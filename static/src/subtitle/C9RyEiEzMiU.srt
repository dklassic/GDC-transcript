1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,933
So I'm going to be talking about maths.

2
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:07,497
And it's maths.

3
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:10,440
You do your GDC talk, and you put it in.

4
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:13,104
And I had one piece of feedback.

5
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:17,249
And that piece of feedback was that I had a typo,

6
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,130
that it's math.

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,271
It's like, it's not.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,462
There are multiple types of math, it's math, you know?

9
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,145
So, what I wanted to talk about is this thing

10
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:31,828
that I worked on, a unified method of noise generation.

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:37,994
Right, so, firstly, I'm gonna talk about

12
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:42,357
some of the problems that we had to solve making No Man's Sky.

13
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:44,619
So I'm going to give you a little bit of history first.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,342
And that's because we were a super small team

15
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:52,586
and we had this problem to solve which is that we made

16
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,028
kind of one of the most played games of last year

17
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,391
with just this really tiny team.

18
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:03,235
And so that brought this whole set of weird problems, right.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,463
Secondly, I'm going to talk about one of our solutions to that problem,

20
00:01:09,643 --> 00:01:13,587
like just kind of one specific small part of that,

21
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:17,770
which is a way, a new way of kind of generating noise that I worked on.

22
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:21,953
And the reason that I've flown in because I want to talk about it

23
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:25,516
is because I hope that other people build on it and I hope, you know,

24
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:35,592
I hope that that is useful to people and I would love to see more in terms of procedural generation, more in games.

25
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:42,856
And that's the third thing I want to talk about is I've got thoughts on where I think procedural generation could go in the future

26
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:45,897
and where we at Hello Games would love to go with it.

27
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:50,198
But first, some history.

28
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:55,160
So I started out at Criterion, which is now EA.

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,500
I got bought by EA.

30
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,162
And I sat down to write this,

31
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:03,823
and I realized, to write a little bit of history about me,

32
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:05,424
I realized I'm really old.

33
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:07,365
I'm so old now.

34
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:10,046
Like, I don't know what happens to old programmers.

35
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:12,827
Like, as in you don't generally see them,

36
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,088
but I presume I'm about to find out, right?

37
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:16,729
Like, I think...

38
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:19,970
I think they come for you in the night, I don't know.

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,750
Something happens, you get disappeared,

40
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,811
but I'm near that time now, right?

41
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,292
Because I started digging out some of this.

42
00:02:27,312 --> 00:02:29,112
So I worked at Criterion, and Criterion,

43
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,973
maybe not so much, maybe not as much now,

44
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:36,714
but at the time was kind of becoming known for engine

45
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:38,735
and kind of cutting edge tech and stuff like that.

46
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:41,135
And there's a reason why I want to explain this.

47
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:43,696
So like I started out there at 21,

48
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,501
as like a junior programmer and I left when I was 25 and I had done stuff like

49
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:53,563
engine coding, engine lead, tech director, stuff like that

50
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:56,364
at various different places on various different games.

51
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,569
The reason I discovered that I'm old is because the first quote about RenderWare,

52
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,091
when they say next generation graphics, they're talking about PS2.

53
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,172
So that's how old I am.

54
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,793
Like, they're coming for me soon.

55
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:19,756
And when they talk about Black, a next generation engine on current generation

56
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:24,497
hardware, that was an engine that I was engine lead on and something I worked on

57
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:24,938
a lot.

58
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:29,239
And that was PS3, like was next generation then.

59
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,693
you know, I'm like one of those old farts that talks about the spectrum all the time.

60
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:42,977
So, I worked there, I actually worked on a whole load of math stuff, so I didn't work

61
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:48,100
on RenderWare, but I ended up writing like this math library that ended up getting used

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,621
in RenderWare, which was in...

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,124
like games that you might have played like GTA and Call of Duty and Battlefield and stuff like that.

64
00:03:55,404 --> 00:04:02,048
And you'll know this because I did the, I optimized the animation code and it's got a bug in it and I

65
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:08,573
saw it in so many games and it was horrible. You would see arms pop inside out and if you saw that

66
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:12,195
then you would, you know, that was me. That's my mark right.

67
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:22,749
So the reason I'm explaining this is because I think engines really dictate design decisions.

68
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,912
And that's almost your first decision, your first design decision on any game is what engine you're using.

69
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,894
And loads of things cascade from that.

70
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:38,697
And like I said there, before somebody lynches me, it's totally fine if you use Unreal or Unity or whatever.

71
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:41,858
It's just not something I have ever done, really.

72
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,140
Like I think they're great and stuff, but...

73
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:49,533
Before starting No Man's Sky,

74
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,615
when I sat down to write the first lines of code,

75
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,296
the previous seven years,

76
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,718
every single year of those seven years,

77
00:04:58,338 --> 00:05:01,080
I had been part of writing a new engine from scratch.

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,121
So I had done that like seven times

79
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:04,362
across seven different games.

80
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:07,024
And like,

81
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,546
it begins to get a bit boring,

82
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,648
and you're solving the same problems all the time.

83
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:14,788
And so,

84
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:15,169
I...

85
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:23,221
guess I wanted to do something a bit new.

86
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,224
So No Man's Sky started as a hobby.

87
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:28,685
It was like a hobby project.

88
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,187
It sort of still is for me.

89
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,811
I love riding engines and I think it's a real craft

90
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,372
and I would hate to see it die out

91
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,033
and I would hate to see us all use Unreal.

92
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,977
Because I think like almost every new genre,

93
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:45,418
when you think of any new genre,

94
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:46,318
it was.

95
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:53,666
created in a new engine right like when you think of doom and things like that, you know, I'm we need

96
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:58,188
The zombie apocalypse is going to come and then who is going to write our engines, right?

97
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:03,950
Somebody needs to remember how to do that. So I think it's a really cool thing and I could never not see doing that

98
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,230
but

99
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,712
it was starting to get boring and we have

100
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:13,893
Gravitated towards a certain place in games where things are are

101
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:17,632
are quite iterative, you know, like you look at,

102
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:20,654
if anyone watches like, looks at Digital Foundry

103
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:22,896
or something like that and they zoom in on images,

104
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,697
you know, comparing two games

105
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:26,658
and they're comparing literally pixels

106
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,980
and between one engine and another,

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,561
you know, in terms of like the anti-aliasing method.

108
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:33,943
So I just wanted to sit down

109
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,285
and write something completely different.

110
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:40,467
Mainly, selfishly, because I just thought of the things

111
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:41,628
that I wanted to learn about.

112
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:46,692
and then I started to write an engine that had those things in, I guess.

113
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:50,295
And that was fun, like, that was really fun

114
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:53,778
and a really fun period of my life where

115
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,381
every evening and weekend I was coming home from coding all day

116
00:06:57,422 --> 00:07:01,605
and I would go and I would write my little engine and that was really fun.

117
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:06,770
Then we showed it, we showed the first trailer

118
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,591
and from then on it was like...

119
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,061
It was like we were building a rocket ship on the way up,

120
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:15,303
like to the sun, being fired into the sun

121
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:18,165
with like the skin burning from our faces, right?

122
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:21,188
It was like, it was a bit of a rollercoaster ride

123
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:21,728
from then on.

124
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:25,070
But at the start, it was genuinely just a hobby

125
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,812
and something super enjoyable.

126
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:33,677
And so it was something new, right?

127
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:35,438
And that's the thing that's easy to forget

128
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:37,079
when you're playing it, is this.

129
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,404
if you are playing No Man's Sky,

130
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:41,805
then you're getting an experience

131
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:45,228
you kind of can't have anywhere else, right?

132
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,110
Like, don't get me wrong,

133
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,512
I'm super excited that this area is being explored now

134
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:53,835
and that you have Star Citizen and Elite and Astroneer

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,236
to help loads of other games

136
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,978
who are doing things in this area

137
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,420
and solving similar types of problems.

138
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,521
But at the time, as we were going through it,

139
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,363
we were going through it reasonably on our own

140
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,885
without a reference point.

141
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:12,468
And it was super technically challenging and that makes it super interesting.

142
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:14,108
And I think

143
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:19,650
that's like selfishly as an engine programmer, that's fun.

144
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,152
Like there's interesting problems there and I had kind of lost that a bit.

145
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:27,033
So,

146
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,814
actually if I just take

147
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,916
some examples of what I mean by that, or just even one little example, right.

148
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,792
Like when you're working in No Man's Sky, when you're working in the engine,

149
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:45,896
like one, you were never within floating point accuracy, right?

150
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:50,878
You were always outside the bounds of what the computer is actually able to compute

151
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,239
and understand.

152
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,321
Your Y is no longer up, which is way more...

153
00:08:56,976 --> 00:09:00,317
It's way more difficult than what you realize, and I'll try and get into that.

154
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:04,218
Nothing can be pre-baked, nothing can be pre-calculated.

155
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,359
Like, every solution to even the smallest problems is really unique.

156
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,799
And I find that quite interesting, like,

157
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,901
really simple example, okay, if you are in any normal game, any normal game,

158
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,682
and you want to put like a little marker over the top of a building,

159
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,724
and then that's really simple you just get the building

160
00:09:25,084 --> 00:09:26,805
get its position and put the marker there

161
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,946
right like that is an easy problem

162
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:30,966
uh... in no man's sky

163
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:32,787
you go to get the building

164
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,809
and let's say the building is on the same planet as you

165
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:40,571
uh... which is one problem but let's say the buildings are the same planet as you

166
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:43,272
you have to account for the curvature of that planet

167
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,133
that building might be directly underneath you

168
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,754
or it might be

169
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,374
you know on the other side of the planet

170
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,035
so now you're gonna have to cast

171
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:55,696
that marker up onto the horizon of where you're stood.

172
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,117
So to do that, you remember that your Y isn't up anymore,

173
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:03,698
so you're going to have to calculate the tangent and bitangent.

174
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,498
You're going to have to think about how close you are to the pole.

175
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:09,159
You're going to have to bring that marker up.

176
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,959
So that's okay, that's not too bad.

177
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:14,520
But maybe it's on another planet, right?

178
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,420
And maybe it's on the back of that planet.

179
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,761
So now you've got to cast that round to the side of that planet.

180
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,495
So that's a little bit tricky.

181
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:27,237
But then there could be another planet between you and that planet.

182
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,238
So you've got to bring it around the side of that one.

183
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:32,860
But then both of those planets might be underneath you,

184
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,441
because there's planets underneath you.

185
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,103
So you've got to take that marker, bring it round, bring it round

186
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:39,023
onto the horizon.

187
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:41,945
And then as you fly towards it, it's got to move to the right place.

188
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:43,586
So that's OK.

189
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:44,386
That's not too bad.

190
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:48,349
Except none of those buildings exist right now.

191
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,415
because they're all being generated,

192
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:53,316
and they're quite expensive to generate.

193
00:10:53,556 --> 00:10:55,616
So now you're going to say, find me the nearest building

194
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,257
of this type.

195
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:59,558
And to do that, you're going to have to start generating

196
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:00,618
where buildings are.

197
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:03,158
And that's really expensive.

198
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:04,599
So now you've got to multithread it,

199
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,160
and you've got to run it over a longer period.

200
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,260
And you're going to have to start generating

201
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,682
actual terrain of planets and working out where buildings are.

202
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,659
and getting the nearest one.

203
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,160
That's too expensive to do,

204
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,621
so you need a bunch of heuristics to do that.

205
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:23,602
And now you've got the building,

206
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,983
but you have to take into account,

207
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:28,424
is it perhaps unable to exist there

208
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:29,745
because it is underwater,

209
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:32,486
because it's on too steep a slope, something like that.

210
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:36,348
So these really complex, expensive things to work out.

211
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:37,729
And then even then,

212
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,170
when you finally get the position of that building,

213
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:47,261
it's not in floating point accuracy, so you're going to have to move between multiple different spaces

214
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,723
in order to get it. Then you can place the marker

215
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:52,005
and then the player can fly towards it.

216
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,689
And I love that, like that is fun.

217
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,253
It means everything takes way longer than what you expect and

218
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,116
it's a whole bunch of different problems, but it's cool, you know,

219
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:04,438
at some point...

220
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:08,973
any game developer here must have hit that point where

221
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:13,099
it's a bit like falling off a log every game that you make you kind of just

222
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:16,084
doing the same things over and over again and this was new and different and

223
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:16,665
exciting

224
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,389
and now that we've done it like

225
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:21,770
it gives us a great

226
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:22,930
kind of

227
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,732
power and capability going forward

228
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,612
for other things that we can do

229
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:31,194
you know if you're a company and you can generate an entire planet in like the

230
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,055
press of a button

231
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:34,316
in moments then

232
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,297
it's so freeing in terms of

233
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:39,918
what kind of games you can make and what kind of problems you can explore and stuff

234
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,261
so I'm just going to click through

235
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,241
some images

236
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,022
and people have taken from the game

237
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:53,579
I just kind of want to get across the diversity in the game at the moment.

238
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:03,223
These are all just from people who've played or taken screenshots.

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,545
So what's interesting about that, which I think there was a really diverse world,

240
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:14,628
is that No Man's Sky is really big, but it's also really small.

241
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,149
It was a 2 gigabyte...

242
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,283
Steam download, but actually most of that was audio.

243
00:13:21,303 --> 00:13:24,646
Another 200 megs was like pre-baked UI.

244
00:13:24,986 --> 00:13:27,268
So everything that you saw there in those screenshots,

245
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:28,689
because they don't show UI and audio,

246
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:32,292
like that was generated in about 300 megs, right?

247
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:34,974
And that's super fun, like I find that super cool.

248
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,817
And like by contrast, when we uploaded for Steam,

249
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:42,861
we had to upload our like, you know, XE,

250
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:46,544
and that's two gigs, and our goddamn four gig banner.

251
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:48,583
PSD, you know.

252
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:51,365
So think like in terms of,

253
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,287
there's a bunch of different unexplored areas

254
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,889
or areas that are super cool right now

255
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,150
in terms of procedural generation,

256
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,951
like web games or things that you download,

257
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:04,954
I think is super interesting.

258
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,516
So it's small,

259
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,119
but it's also a game that was,

260
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,961
it was played quite a lot.

261
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,172
So if you take, I'm just gonna talk about some of the games

262
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,094
that I've worked on, so if you take Joe Danger,

263
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:25,918
of which there were like.

264
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:28,203
for Joe Danger, right?

265
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,545
You take all the Joe Dangers and you put them all together.

266
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,507
We sold about a million copies of Joe Danger.

267
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:36,568
And it was played a lot.

268
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,209
It was really well liked and well reviewed

269
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:39,650
and stuff like that.

270
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,932
But the total number of hours is like this, okay?

271
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:45,374
And then this makes me a bit sad.

272
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,555
So there was a game I worked on, Black,

273
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:50,537
which sold really well, like exceptionally well.

274
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:52,558
And this is the total number of hours

275
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:55,039
that Black was played for by comparison to Joe Danger,

276
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,260
which is kind of annoying.

277
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,001
and you know having just come from there.

278
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,223
So before that and a bunch of time in between

279
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:06,763
some of the team that I work with,

280
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,165
we worked on Burnout.

281
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,786
So Burnout in particular, I'm taking Burnout 3 here,

282
00:15:14,186 --> 00:15:18,727
which was like probably the most played Burnout.

283
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:20,968
Really highly reviewed, sold incredibly well,

284
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:22,728
and that's what that looks like.

285
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,195
and tons of total number of hours played

286
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:31,418
and you're talking about roughly similar numbers of copies sold between black and

287
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,058
burn out and

288
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,099
uh... things like that

289
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,420
uh...

290
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,940
black was a shorter game

291
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:39,442
uh... so

292
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:43,664
this is this is sort of depressing for Joe Danger

293
00:15:43,684 --> 00:15:45,585
uh... but no man's sky

294
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:47,866
dwarfs them in terms of

295
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:49,027
uh...

296
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:50,088
hours played

297
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:55,483
And in fact, if you look at Steam and things like that,

298
00:15:56,683 --> 00:16:00,904
you know, compared to a lot of the big releases of the year,

299
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:05,245
like Deus Ex or Far Cry or something like that,

300
00:16:05,806 --> 00:16:10,007
you know, No Man's Sky is, to my surprise,

301
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:12,087
significantly above those, you know?

302
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,948
And he's, like I said, one of the most played games

303
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:15,288
of the year.

304
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:20,915
And that, I think, and the reason I'm bringing that up is not some boast or something,

305
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:24,938
it's because I think it is down to the diversity of the worlds.

306
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,482
And it's really interesting to me, the sheer amount of time that people can play for.

307
00:16:30,043 --> 00:16:31,364
Like, we have a...

308
00:16:32,763 --> 00:16:37,326
kind of scary number of people who've played for 100 hours or more.

309
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:42,029
Like so far beyond any other game that I've worked on.

310
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:45,511
And loads of people, like I'm not sure how to feel about this,

311
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:49,073
who have played for a thousand hours, which is like the game has been out six months,

312
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:53,076
it's like five hours a day, every day or something like that.

313
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:58,139
Except presumably it's like three solid weeks of not eating and not sleeping,

314
00:16:58,219 --> 00:16:59,279
or something like that instead.

315
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:03,833
And we were a super small team.

316
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,234
I probably harp on about this a lot,

317
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:10,576
but I do it to give credit to the team that worked on it.

318
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,858
Like actually, if you average it out,

319
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,979
there was only about six people working on the game.

320
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,140
You know, like as in average.

321
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:22,383
It was an incredibly small team,

322
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:26,725
and that, you know, we are publisher and things like that,

323
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:30,207
so that includes production, publishing,

324
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:31,668
marketing, and all that,

325
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:32,148
not that we're.

326
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,970
you know, very good with that kind of thing.

327
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,335
So that gives you a little bit of an overview of

328
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:44,801
like the history of the game and my history and stuff like that.

329
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:48,785
So I wanted to get into the kind of

330
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,869
like how we created that diversity.

331
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,531
And I'm going to pick one thing in particular.

332
00:17:56,278 --> 00:18:00,601
So I wanted to talk about actually noise generation.

333
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:03,043
So this is a gross simplification,

334
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:06,725
but basically we generate a whole bunch of noise,

335
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,547
which is like the terrain and a bunch of other stuff,

336
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:13,330
clouds and populations of stuff and things like that.

337
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:18,533
That all goes into some voxels, then we polygonize it,

338
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,415
then that goes to render physics,

339
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,157
population, that kind of thing.

340
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:25,378
Ines did a.

341
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:30,084
good talk earlier and it's way more complicated than that but

342
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:31,966
I don't understand it all

343
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,529
and no it's it's just

344
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,512
just because I'm going to talk about the noise generation

345
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:39,994
and so I'm going to talk about

346
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:44,652
a bunch of different ways that I tried to solve this problem.

347
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:47,873
And the problem was creating diverse worlds

348
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,854
that would surprise me when I'm playing

349
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:54,095
and would kind of surprise anyone who played

350
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:56,336
and keep them interested

351
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:59,737
and meant that they could play for hundreds of hours and see something new,

352
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:01,998
but also remained playable

353
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:05,419
and also remained, like, predictable in a way

354
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:08,420
in that I needed to know how much memory they were going to take and...

355
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,605
what kind of performance they would have and stuff like that.

356
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:14,946
So, my first attempt,

357
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,950
this is like way back, five years ago, I just copied Minecraft.

358
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,055
That was quite popular at the time, to clone Minecraft.

359
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:29,039
So, by that I mean the same method as Minecraft users, which is

360
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,781
trilinear filtered,

361
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,083
kind of low density.

362
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:37,958
Perlin noise fields stacked on top of each other.

363
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,361
So I was actually, like, Notch has talked about this a bit,

364
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:46,063
but at the time, what I did was I got Minecraft

365
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:49,544
and I disassembled it, and then I named all the variables

366
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,045
and I worked out how it was working,

367
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,927
which is probably bad, but we didn't use it,

368
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:56,168
so it's fine, and I can't be sued, right?

369
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,840
I hope, I think, I hope, right?

370
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,741
But yeah, it was really interesting.

371
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,164
And the reason I did that is because no one talks about this

372
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:07,405
but Minecraft is amazing.

373
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:08,847
Like in terms of the worlds,

374
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:11,729
like I think that is the secret.

375
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,591
And anyone who clones Minecraft, they always forget that

376
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:16,773
and they end up with way less interesting worlds.

377
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:19,615
And I think it is the core

378
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:22,277
of why Minecraft is so compelling, right?

379
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,639
And why it's been such a phenomenon.

380
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:32,376
Now the problem is we were polygonizing these worlds and we were making something that was more realistic.

381
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:40,603
And the thing that makes Minecraft really interesting is all this kind of terraced shape and makes it play really well.

382
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:47,129
And the reality is that when you put something realistic over that, it's like draping a cloth over that.

383
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,772
And these are low-density points.

384
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:55,765
on a Perlin noise field and then trilinear filtered off.

385
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:59,027
So effectively what you have is just a load of mounds

386
00:20:59,328 --> 00:21:02,510
and pyramids when you put that cloth over the top.

387
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:07,215
And actually it doesn't work in a realistic sense.

388
00:21:08,132 --> 00:21:11,653
So it didn't play particularly well for us and actually you expect to see

389
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:14,474
way, you know, instantly you want

390
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,034
crevices, you want erosion, you want

391
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:20,615
you know, you want this kind of thing, which is actually built in Minecraft.

392
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:24,556
But you want this kind of detail, this more realistic shapes and mountain

393
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:25,676
shapes and things like that.

394
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:29,057
So I abandoned that

395
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,458
and then I just tried something simpler, so

396
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,998
just high density

397
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:36,738
rather than low density, high density noise fields.

398
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,041
Straight kind of Perlin noise.

399
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:43,465
This is what Space Engine uses if you're used to that.

400
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:44,827
It's the classic

401
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:46,909
image of a terrain sim.

402
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,530
I'll show you what I mean.

403
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,532
This is a render from Terrigen

404
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,295
and this is Perlin noise.

405
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:01,998
I go through like people's CVs and demos and stuff like that when they apply

406
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:06,761
and like this is the classic thing that you see which is just unaltered Perlin noise

407
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:10,803
and it sort of looks like mountains but it also sort of doesn't.

408
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:16,827
I used to apply loads of image processing to this to pick out features, highlights,

409
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,729
add more contrast, things like that, layer loads of things on top of each other

410
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:25,912
and in some of our earlier like videos and demos and stuff like that we were...

411
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:28,150
using some of these methods but

412
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:32,234
the worlds aren't that interesting and actually the real world isn't like this

413
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:37,258
the features are extremely repetitive in Perlin noise

414
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,942
and they also are unrealistic in that

415
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:44,344
the slope, the gradient is reasonably constant

416
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:47,827
and that's not what you see in the real world, in the real world you see

417
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,529
sharp cliffs, you see

418
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,091
way more distribution of noise

419
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,633
which brings me on to the next thing that I tried

420
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:02,935
So DEM data is digital elevation map data.

421
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:05,437
And you can just download it online.

422
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,519
And it's the real world, if you know,

423
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,705
real world data just like captured,

424
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:16,727
it's kind of what Google Maps and things like that,

425
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,849
it's contour data from the real world

426
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,790
captured at various points.

427
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:26,788
and I thought it would be cool and somebody else had already done it in Parbury

428
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,809
way better than me

429
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,033
but download this and actually extract data from it so parse

430
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:34,974
like just take

431
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:37,376
Utah or something like that right

432
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,838
and then parse all the data from it

433
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,180
and work out what's the rate of change of slopes and shapes

434
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,180
and try and get some of that data out

435
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,201
and then feed that back into noise generation.

436
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,722
Work out the distribution of shape change

437
00:23:53,822 --> 00:23:56,183
because I decided that the distribution of shape change

438
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:58,263
in parallel noise isn't very realistic.

439
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:01,844
And these shots are taken from that.

440
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,751
paper in Parbury, which is a really good paper.

441
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:12,133
And his conclusion, and mine's the same,

442
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:16,554
that noise in the real world is exponentially distributed.

443
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:18,835
And you'll see what I mean.

444
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:22,256
Okay, so this is normal Perlin noise,

445
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:24,877
and then this is when you train Perlin noise

446
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,698
basically on DM data.

447
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:29,259
So you get something that's much more realistic.

448
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:36,811
right and and this like if I had my time over like I would love to put more time

449
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:44,854
into this this is such a rich area for investigation and it is however

450
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:52,275
unfortunate the real world is super boring and so we would put this into our

451
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:56,136
game and I don't know if anyone's ever been for a walk

452
00:24:57,067 --> 00:25:00,569
but it turns out walking in the real world is super boring.

453
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,773
I hadn't been, but I realized that playing the game, right?

454
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:08,035
Like, you walk for ages and nothing happens.

455
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,717
And so that's what was going on.

456
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:15,061
And I said that I'd used Utah,

457
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:16,803
and I said it to my friend who lives in Utah,

458
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:17,803
and he said, like, oh,

459
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,867
you can, like, Utah's so flat sometimes

460
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,849
that you can see the back of your own head, right?

461
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:31,390
So, but this is a video from that talk.

462
00:25:32,771 --> 00:25:35,372
And you see, it looks awesome, it looks real.

463
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:38,073
And this is what you want,

464
00:25:38,113 --> 00:25:40,154
but you just want it at a different scale.

465
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:42,996
These are the kinds of shapes that we want, right?

466
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:45,617
But you can see, that is pretty boring.

467
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,003
Okay, so, I went from there to a thing called UberNoise.

468
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:57,943
I call it UberNoise.

469
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:02,706
And that's this kind of unifying method of noise generation.

470
00:26:06,749 --> 00:26:10,892
So, the reality is all that experimentation before,

471
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,154
and that happened over the course of about like,

472
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,615
three or four years,

473
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:19,359
informed what we needed and what we didn't.

474
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:22,919
what we wanted from this and what was possible and what was

475
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:27,841
what makes something fun to play what doesn't what controllability we want

476
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:28,501
and things like that

477
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:29,941
okay so

478
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,882
and I say over the course of four years like

479
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:36,764
I can't explain this enough but

480
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:41,025
No Man's Sky was such a small team in the majority of the time there's only a few

481
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:42,005
programmers on it

482
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:42,886
and

483
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:47,717
Any one programmer like myself, we were doing a million different things.

484
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:52,600
So this would be like every once in a while I would get a week to work on this,

485
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,881
or I would work on it in my spare time or something.

486
00:26:55,901 --> 00:27:03,545
And so let me take you through some of the things that I'd used previously,

487
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:07,868
and then I'm going to talk about how I kind of brought all those things together

488
00:27:07,908 --> 00:27:09,208
and what that leads to.

489
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:13,627
Okay, so here are the current noise methods

490
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:15,868
that you see really commonly used.

491
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,268
Lots of different places use this.

492
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,950
So Perlin, Simplex, Billow, Ridge, Worley,

493
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,531
analytical derivatives, domain warping,

494
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:26,292
and I'm just gonna take you through a couple of those.

495
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,834
So, Perlin, this is what you've seen.

496
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:39,104
Everywhere this is that like and I don't mean to sound bad about it Perlin super amazing, right?

497
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:46,414
And Ken Perlin one is like Oscar for this and stuff like that and everyone still uses it and it's cool

498
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:56,541
What's going on is basically that you are taking random noise, which looks like your TV when it's tuned to static,

499
00:27:56,962 --> 00:28:02,585
and it's just completely random noise, and then you're kind of creating gradients from that,

500
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:07,908
and creating something that is more cohesive, and ultimately has this kind of shape,

501
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:10,490
right, almost like a sine wave.

502
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,110
And...

503
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:13,671
But...

504
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,594
it is kind of cohesive and it is fractal.

505
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,195
So if you take fractional Brownian motion,

506
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:28,957
you put multiple layers of this noise on top of each other

507
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:32,138
at different amplitudes and differing frequencies.

508
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:34,578
And so you can imagine if you did that here,

509
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:35,699
you would start to get something

510
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:37,019
that looked much more mountainous.

511
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,940
But I'm just gonna go with one octave of noise.

512
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,061
But obviously you would use multiple, multiple octaves.

513
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:49,237
So below, so like this,

514
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:53,039
this like, I'm embarrassed by this,

515
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,280
but this is this graph,

516
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,782
and then you just put in an abs, okay?

517
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,564
So you just abs everything that's underneath,

518
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:03,306
and you get something that looks more like rounded hills.

519
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,568
So we want, sometimes as we're walking around the terrain,

520
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:07,969
so when I talk about Uber Noise,

521
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,051
sometimes you want it to look like this,

522
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:12,653
and sometimes you want these nice round hills.

523
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:16,442
and kind of create rolling hills and

524
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:16,502
uh...

525
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,885
like sharp creases and stuff like that

526
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:21,546
so it's really simple so you just

527
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:23,428
abs it as you go

528
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:30,214
and then taking the complement of that so just one minus

529
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,536
you start to get like

530
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:37,030
like these really sharp ridges.

531
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,632
So you get ridge noise, which people talk about and use.

532
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:43,834
And actually, this does a disservice.

533
00:29:43,854 --> 00:29:46,655
This obviously looks really simple, or it looks like.

534
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:50,829
kind of like Bart Simpson's hair or something like that.

535
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:56,471
But in real terms, if you do this in 3D and you do enough octaves, it looks super realistic.

536
00:29:56,531 --> 00:30:00,012
And it's the kind of terrain sim noise that you've seen before.

537
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,674
Normally this would look genuinely like Alpine mountains.

538
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:09,336
If you've used Terrigen or something like that, or Worldbuilder, you see that kind of thing.

539
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:10,696
This, though...

540
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,435
This is the good stuff, right?

541
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,617
So this is really important. Anyone who's doing noise and who's not using this,

542
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,319
like, you absolutely should, right?

543
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:35,189
So, what we want is to have our features change in relation to different octaves of noise.

544
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:41,313
Like, that's what happens in the real world. So, I'm gonna explain a thing, but it's probably really obvious.

545
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:45,475
we have this massive array of voxels,

546
00:30:45,695 --> 00:30:46,856
like billions of them,

547
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:50,018
and we are gonna generate one voxel.

548
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:52,199
So we're just gonna pick an X, Y, Z position

549
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,640
somewhere in the universe,

550
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,082
and we are going to say, fill in this voxel.

551
00:30:57,443 --> 00:30:59,445
And when you do that,

552
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:03,087
you cannot, as part of that equation,

553
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:06,830
you can never query the voxels round about you.

554
00:31:07,777 --> 00:31:10,799
Because if you had to do that, to generate this voxel here,

555
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,042
like in this world, to generate this one,

556
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:16,424
you needed to ask this one what was in it,

557
00:31:17,184 --> 00:31:19,186
then that cascades, because to generate that one,

558
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:20,807
you need to ask that one, to generate that one,

559
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:21,868
and it goes on and on and on,

560
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:24,310
and it's an intractable problem, right?

561
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,313
So because of that, it's really hard to have erosion,

562
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:29,714
which is what you really want,

563
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,297
because in order, it would be simple to have erosion

564
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:34,458
if you knew that when you were generating a voxel,

565
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,001
that it was on a mountain, or that it was high up or low down,

566
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:41,504
or that it was perhaps at the bottom of like a lake or something like that,

567
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:45,146
but you can't find that out because you can't ask any of the voxels around you.

568
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:49,269
And it seems like this almost unsolvable problem,

569
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:52,071
and it's a real problem if you're generating caves,

570
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,694
or you're generating erosion, or you're generating rivers,

571
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:57,996
because one feature needs to flow into another,

572
00:31:58,136 --> 00:32:00,938
and it needs context, and you can't get that context.

573
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:03,980
But what you can guess is the...

574
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:11,278
derivative, if you had that, then you would know the rate of change of noise at that point.

575
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:16,081
When you have that, you know that you are on a slope, or you're on a flat, or you're

576
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:17,621
trending upwards or downwards.

577
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:24,906
And if you have that knowledge, and you can return from Perlin Noise the analytical derivative,

578
00:32:26,307 --> 00:32:29,869
then you're going to be able to have certain features.

579
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:36,512
much more prominent on slopes, so you can make them much more noisy or much less noisy.

580
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:39,695
You know, if you were in a desert, then slopes are very smooth.

581
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:45,101
If you were, you know, in the Alps or something like that, then slopes are very, very craggy

582
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:45,661
and noisy.

583
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:48,624
And that's exactly what we need.

584
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:51,707
And it's kind of, it's an awesome trick, and once you have that...

585
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:55,128
then there are so many things that you're unable to do.

586
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,749
We also, from this UberNoise function,

587
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:03,290
we need the analytical derivative returned from UberNoise.

588
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,730
So even after it's calculated,

589
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,650
all this billow and stuff like that and ridge,

590
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,651
we need to know that analytical derivative

591
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:12,451
so that we can feed it in further to other things.

592
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,912
And I'm just gonna shout these out

593
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:21,173
because this site's IQ, who probably everyone knows

594
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:21,613
who works in.

595
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:25,896
It works at Noise, it used to work at Pixar, and is now at Oculus, I think,

596
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,978
and runs a Patreon, whichever one's your sponsor.

597
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,741
These sites explain this far better than I do.

598
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:40,205
And I actually am about to steal some images from those sites, so

599
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:42,467
don't sue me for that,

600
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:45,068
because they lay it out really well.

601
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:46,609
Here's an example.

602
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,030
This is what like...

603
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:52,198
kind of normal, boring, repetitive Perlin noise looks like.

604
00:33:52,538 --> 00:33:55,119
But then if we feed in the derivative,

605
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,540
we can start maybe smoothing out some of the slopes.

606
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,701
Having little pockets of detail in there.

607
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:05,602
And this looks, I hope that's obvious,

608
00:34:05,922 --> 00:34:09,643
but it's really obvious when you're down in amongst this,

609
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:13,164
playing the game, is way more interesting

610
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:14,624
and is way more realistic.

611
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:16,345
And gives way more variety,

612
00:34:16,385 --> 00:34:17,685
and this is the kind of thing we want.

613
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:24,147
When I'm talking about this, by the way, I'm going to talk about it as if we're generating one layer of noise,

614
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:28,670
but like, in No Man's Sky we generate so many layers of noise.

615
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:32,973
Like layers upon layers, and each one feeds into the next, into the next, into the next.

616
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,203
So the other thing I'm going to talk about, and I'm going to steal some images here as well,

617
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:41,224
is domain warping.

618
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,026
This is super cool.

619
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,787
And this is basically

620
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:48,570
distorting the domain of the noise that we're generating with another function.

621
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:51,773
And often feeding noise into itself

622
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:54,255
in kind of

623
00:34:54,315 --> 00:34:55,376
successive octaves.

624
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,357
So this is a little snippet.

625
00:34:57,758 --> 00:35:00,340
This is what normal Perlin noise looks like.

626
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:09,603
So let's feed in another function, warp it, and you start to get something that looks a bit more realistic.

627
00:35:09,703 --> 00:35:15,867
I don't know if that's obvious, like, I've looked at this for so long that that's really obvious to me.

628
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,609
But I'll try and show you. So let's do that again.

629
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:27,969
And now, hopefully you can see, that looks a little bit more like an aerial photograph of some terrain.

630
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:32,051
And in case that's not obvious, here it is blown up.

631
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:35,714
And you can start to see things that look maybe like rivers and things like that.

632
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,256
We actually use this to create our coastlines, our rivers,

633
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:45,440
and also if you look really closely you can kind of see shapes look like they're flowing into one another.

634
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:48,553
It's kind of like, you can see why it's called warping.

635
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:51,133
You're just warping the image.

636
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,774
IQ has an awesome image on his site

637
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:55,614
where he has colorized these.

638
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,815
And I think I could easily be looking at

639
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:02,795
an aerial photograph of some terrain, right?

640
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:07,376
Like, if I just flick to some real terrain,

641
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,156
like this is real terrain.

642
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:12,037
Real terrain's really fractally, right?

643
00:36:12,277 --> 00:36:13,637
Like it's so, you know.

644
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:14,987
It's awesome.

645
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:17,788
But just going back and forth between them,

646
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,829
you can see really similar kind of shapes evolving.

647
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,329
And like with this,

648
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:24,350
if you were to start filling this with water,

649
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,171
if you imagine water coming up from this,

650
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:31,312
that you would see all those little cracks start to fill in

651
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:32,432
and you would get little rivers.

652
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:34,593
You can see some of them up in the kind of top right

653
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:35,073
and stuff.

654
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:38,794
And that looks really nice and starts to not look like,

655
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:42,615
you know, kind of a classic terrain sim at all.

656
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:54,707
So, what we want from our UberNoise is we want domain warping, like I just explained.

657
00:36:54,727 --> 00:37:01,390
We want erosion on our slopes, we want control over altitude erosion, we want ridges, plateaus,

658
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:06,032
terraces, rolling hills, we want non-repeating features, and we want an analytical derivative

659
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:10,314
returned at the end of it so we can go and feed that into more layers of UberNoise.

660
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:14,756
And this is kind of how, this is the function for how.

661
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,461
terrains are generated in No Man's Sky.

662
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:25,664
So this is the function that we want, right?

663
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:29,725
We want each of these to be a little individual control and in case it's not

664
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:30,285
obvious

665
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:33,266
you would take yet more noise

666
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:35,147
over the top.

667
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:38,138
and generate these floating point values.

668
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:44,143
So you're going to vary the warp over time or the sharpness

669
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:46,285
or the amplification of features or whatever.

670
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:51,830
Which gives really varied features as you walk around.

671
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,494
So sharpness is really easy.

672
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,256
That's just like I explained before.

673
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:01,638
Just getting your ridge and your billowed noise.

674
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:05,919
and then just kind of blending between them. So now instead of just being binary

675
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,601
we can just blend between them.

676
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:13,508
Slope erosion, just like we were talking about before,

677
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:16,852
again this is where you're going to be able to control

678
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,516
the amount of noise and kind of detail

679
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:21,477
on your slopes.

680
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:28,088
You also have altitude damping, so things that you want to do sometimes is you want to have

681
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:34,220
like a basin that flattens out or maybe some, you know, kind of like you would guess in

682
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:38,415
I guess, erosion that comes,

683
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,855
like, because you have various different types of erosion.

684
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:43,896
And a lot of these can be used to mimic that.

685
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:47,497
So you can have tectonic erosion or glacial erosion.

686
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:50,658
You get these more smooth shapes coming in sometimes.

687
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:53,859
And what you're doing is you're varying the amplitude

688
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:56,340
based on the derivative.

689
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,821
We're gonna perturb the domain,

690
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:01,661
so like domain warping, those are gonna create

691
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:05,102
our nice little flows of rivers and things.

692
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:10,372
and amplifying some features.

693
00:39:10,773 --> 00:39:14,734
And this is really simple and it drives me crazy

694
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:16,355
that I didn't think of this earlier

695
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,336
and I didn't work on it more.

696
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:20,697
As you go between octaves,

697
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,863
The lesson that I learned from the exponentially distributed noise,

698
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:32,846
a really nice trick is to have different emphasis on different octaves of your noise.

699
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:38,449
And to have certain features really stand out and damp down certain features.

700
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:44,112
It creates... So, like, a really nice trick is to have your first octave

701
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,615
not actually be that prominent, because that's what's giving you these really repetitive

702
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:50,476
sequences of mountains.

703
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,917
Varying that makes a huge difference.

704
00:39:54,578 --> 00:39:57,359
Having some of the lower octaves have more impact.

705
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,101
Now that's an area where we could have, and we didn't,

706
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:05,703
where we could have taken the learning from exponential distributed noise,

707
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:08,425
take some DEM data and start feeding it into this,

708
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:11,907
and have every octave have a different kind of emphasis

709
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:13,507
as we go through the terrain.

710
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:16,509
So I'm going to show you some images.

711
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:22,919
And these are just, I just screenshot of these a minute ago.

712
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,300
But just booted up on a planet and flew around

713
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,200
and took some pictures.

714
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,761
Okay, so you can start to see some of the features

715
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:29,661
that you're getting involving.

716
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:32,422
So when you have 3D noise,

717
00:40:32,782 --> 00:40:36,864
you're also getting at the sides,

718
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,584
you can see sheer cliffs sometimes,

719
00:40:40,025 --> 00:40:40,925
and other times not.

720
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,466
Really round shapes sometimes.

721
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:46,707
So that's coming from our amplification

722
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:47,847
of features sometimes.

723
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:53,290
and also I'm talking about noise as if it's being generated in 2D

724
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,172
the reality is we mix 2D and 3D a lot

725
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:00,693
so that's why you get these kind of overhangs

726
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:02,654
and that's something that

727
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:04,455
a lot of

728
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:07,476
kind of demos that you see

729
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:11,858
like of planet generation and things like that

730
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,619
they're in 2D

731
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,100
and

732
00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:19,495
and two-dimensional generations, a generation of height fields, is so much easier

733
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:24,617
because literally, you go from having to generate millions of voxels

734
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:26,557
to having to generate billions of voxels.

735
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:30,818
But it's worth it to get caves and overhangs, and we needed that

736
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:33,539
because otherwise the terrains aren't interesting enough.

737
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:38,140
And the real core part of exploration is to have those shapes, to have...

738
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:42,991
these non-smooth shapes and to have things like cliff edges and stuff like that.

739
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:48,192
So here you're seeing that domain warping, you're seeing that kind of snake through,

740
00:41:48,212 --> 00:41:55,493
and a huge differentiation in noises there, where you're not seeing those repeating hills, right?

741
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:58,334
You're seeing massive hills sometimes, other times not.

742
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:03,955
And we have, you know, kilometer, two kilometer high mountains sometimes,

743
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:07,855
each with like little caves inside them and things.

744
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,721
These overhangs again are super cool. I haven't really talked about caves, but caves is a

745
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:21,104
super difficult problem, much like the erosion was, because you need to know when you generate

746
00:42:21,144 --> 00:42:25,286
the cave how are you going to break through so that it actually has a hole that comes out when

747
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:30,609
you generate that hole. Because remember that when you're generating any voxel, you cannot know about

748
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:36,052
the voxels around it. To generate that cave and to generate it breaking through the terrain

749
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,733
is a difficult problem.

750
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:42,546
This is a nice image.

751
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:45,848
So this is just actually, I happen to know,

752
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:47,209
is one layer of noise.

753
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,070
So this is just one layer of Uber noise.

754
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,871
And you're seeing so many different things going on there.

755
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:55,894
So down in the bottom, that's domain warping

756
00:42:55,934 --> 00:42:57,274
that's giving you those nice shapes.

757
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:58,795
If you were to fill that in with water,

758
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:00,536
you would get really nice little rivers

759
00:43:00,556 --> 00:43:01,457
and things going through.

760
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:05,779
You're seeing steep cliffs, and then at time round edges.

761
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,374
You're seeing in the far distance a real change

762
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:15,837
in terms of like heights of mountains and things like that.

763
00:43:16,198 --> 00:43:17,539
And actually their shapes are changing.

764
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,540
I don't know if that's obvious, if you can make that out.

765
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,182
They're going between quite round

766
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:23,563
to starting to be quite sheer.

767
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:28,315
And this is one of the things that I think really works in No Man's Sky.

768
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:32,656
One of the reasons why people play it for so long is because we get it all the time.

769
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:36,297
We get people saying, I played for a hundred hours and then I landed on this planet

770
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:38,677
and it looked like something I hadn't seen before.

771
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,678
And so I think that's cool, that's interesting.

772
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:46,819
And people know because they know they haven't seen it before that it's different.

773
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:48,400
It gives a real sense of exploration.

774
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,900
It's important to the game.

775
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,231
Okay, there's loads of stuff that I haven't talked about

776
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:56,513
that if I didn't hate talking to you all

777
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:59,595
that I would love to talk about some time in the future

778
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,516
so if people want to ask me about it, they can.

779
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:05,659
Creating SDFs, maintaining that, that's a difficult problem.

780
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:10,082
Caves, features, terraces, erosion flowing into rivers.

781
00:44:10,202 --> 00:44:12,084
And the really difficult one is

782
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:17,127
noise is very unpredictable and non-evenly distributed.

783
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:20,462
and okay so

784
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:24,625
let's go through this real quickly, I'm probably running out of time

785
00:44:25,806 --> 00:44:27,148
so I wanted to talk about

786
00:44:27,808 --> 00:44:30,711
how difficult it was to build this and to test this

787
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:34,520
So, we're talking about testing the untestable, right?

788
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:38,322
An infinite number of planets and permutations, you can't possibly test them all.

789
00:44:38,602 --> 00:44:40,343
You've got limited memory and performance.

790
00:44:40,983 --> 00:44:43,485
Every player, I mean, think about what a nightmare this is.

791
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:46,266
Every player is going to boot up into a different star system

792
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:48,227
and have different memory requirements.

793
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:49,968
And we can't know.

794
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:51,488
Like, we cannot know.

795
00:44:51,828 --> 00:44:52,569
We can guess.

796
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,209
We can use heuristics.

797
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,990
What we did in the end was...

798
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,304
flying little drones out, you know, effectively.

799
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:02,086
We had a smoke test and that would run

800
00:45:02,106 --> 00:45:04,389
and it would return how the overall performance

801
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,312
of the game was doing after every check-in.

802
00:45:06,672 --> 00:45:09,896
And it would also, like, send back info, right?

803
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:11,999
And we could just do it by numbers,

804
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,500
but we can't possibly.

805
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:15,883
test every single permutation.

806
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,445
So we tried to generally fire out

807
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:22,068
about as many and run as much tests and stuff like that,

808
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:25,591
test as much as we could to the kinds of numbers of players

809
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,032
that we thought we were going to have.

810
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:31,055
So we were trying to guess how many players

811
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:31,716
that we would have.

812
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:35,479
So we kind of looked at what was out there at the moment.

813
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,762
So we were looking at like the two previous games

814
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,263
that had come out on Steam, right?

815
00:45:42,084 --> 00:45:43,704
that we had no better way of doing it, right?

816
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:46,945
So Inside was an indie game, we're an indie game.

817
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:49,385
It felt like everyone was playing it when it came out.

818
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:50,946
It is an awesome game.

819
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:53,146
They beat us at every awards.

820
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:54,466
They deserve us.

821
00:45:54,786 --> 00:45:55,547
It's beautiful.

822
00:45:56,347 --> 00:45:59,327
So they had had about 3,000 players concurrently.

823
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:02,908
That's kind of where I thought we would be.

824
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,228
But Sony would occasionally say to us,

825
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:08,089
like, well, this is kind of a triple A type product.

826
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,087
And so we were looking at things like Far Cry.

827
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:12,948
So this was like the game that had just come out.

828
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:15,369
It's a huge game obviously, I love Far Cry.

829
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:18,831
So they'd had like 14,000 players, max concurrent.

830
00:46:19,772 --> 00:46:22,654
And we kind of, that made us feel a little bit nervous

831
00:46:22,854 --> 00:46:25,335
in terms of our servers and the amount of people,

832
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,617
sheer number of people booting up day one.

833
00:46:28,357 --> 00:46:30,159
You know, like 14,000 people are gonna play,

834
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:31,679
are we testing it to that degree?

835
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:36,348
We had more players than we expected.

836
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:38,911
So we had around 250,000 when it launched on PC.

837
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:51,773
But the other problem, which is a lot, and the other problem was that people were still playing on PS4 when we launched.

838
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:58,699
So at the time of launch of PC, there was around 500,000 people playing.

839
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:04,904
Which is difficult when they are all booting up on planets that you haven't been to.

840
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:07,366
And it's extremely nerve-wracking.

841
00:47:07,426 --> 00:47:10,028
And when, like, the networking team...

842
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:14,199
who is handling the uploads and connection to the server.

843
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:16,980
He's like one guy, and it's only one of his jobs.

844
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,481
And we had like half a billion discoveries uploaded.

845
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:24,682
It was like insane numbers that we were dealing with.

846
00:47:25,922 --> 00:47:28,643
But it was super fun,

847
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,624
and it's a super interesting thing to do.

848
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:35,205
When we launched,

849
00:47:35,225 --> 00:47:37,366
we had.

850
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:44,079
about 1% of players on PC

851
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,080
having crashes in terms of crash dumps that we were getting and stuff like that.

852
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:51,061
Most of those were people operating at a min spec,

853
00:47:51,421 --> 00:47:52,382
but there was a bunch of

854
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:53,702
things in terms of

855
00:47:54,302 --> 00:47:58,203
like as you would guess, memory and stuff like that. It was pretty much on par with

856
00:47:58,283 --> 00:48:01,284
games that I've released before, so games like Burnout and stuff like that,

857
00:48:01,704 --> 00:48:03,865
but we were just operating at a different scale.

858
00:48:04,905 --> 00:48:08,126
It was far beyond what I'd experienced before in terms of

859
00:48:09,046 --> 00:48:10,727
people playing a game kind of thing.

860
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,691
and by the time foundation came out which was our update

861
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:21,953
and we had far far fewer so it was about .01 percent

862
00:48:22,473 --> 00:48:25,954
and we had about a million people playing on the day that foundation

863
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:30,216
released and a really small number of kind of crash dumps from that

864
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:34,537
and again most of that was just playing outside of min spec and things like that

865
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:39,099
and but we've kind of learned that lesson a thing

866
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,320
that

867
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:46,190
that is a little bit crazy is to fix some of the bugs

868
00:48:47,571 --> 00:48:51,394
but also because we wanted to really embellish the worlds that we had

869
00:48:52,455 --> 00:48:52,655
and

870
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:54,958
we rebuilt

871
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:56,759
the universe which meant

872
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:58,521
just doing it all over again

873
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:00,182
and so

874
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:03,105
rebuilding the universe, resetting all the players

875
00:49:04,256 --> 00:49:08,078
So no matter what you're doing in the game, we've got to take you and place you somewhere safe.

876
00:49:08,138 --> 00:49:10,559
Maybe you're just repairing your ship,

877
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,502
maybe you're just about to get to crash ship or you're in the middle of a battle or whatever and you've saved your game.

878
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:20,344
We have to sort you out even though the entire universe has changed.

879
00:49:20,985 --> 00:49:22,105
And that's a fun thing,

880
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:29,729
when you know that people are going to update and just go through a million different edge cases.

881
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,511
But it's a really unique game and there's, like I said, unique problems that come with it.

882
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:39,056
But that's something that we're going to keep on doing is actually continuing to work on this terrain.

883
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:42,218
And it's something that people can't quite put their finger on.

884
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:47,782
So with the Foundation update, something we kept hearing was that the game feels a little bit more epic,

885
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,104
or that there's a different feel to it, and that...

886
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:56,787
is the terrain. I know because when our changes went in, everyone on the team started saying it.

887
00:49:57,228 --> 00:50:01,049
And it's hard to put your finger on exactly why, but you know that you're visiting more

888
00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:04,691
interesting places and things you haven't seen before. And that's something we're going to keep

889
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:12,554
doing. Which is fun and scary and a very unique problem. Most people don't update their game and

890
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:19,457
have every level change entirely in construct kind of thing. It's weird. So yeah.

891
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:26,490
The thing I wanted to say is that we're hiring.

892
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:27,811
This is,

893
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:32,974
I guess I know that procedural generation

894
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:37,256
will be a small part of games in the future.

895
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:41,258
I mean, loads of the talks at GDC,

896
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:44,500
whether it was Horizon or Wildland,

897
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,282
were talking about procedural generation components

898
00:50:47,302 --> 00:50:47,922
to their games.

899
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:49,543
Super cool.

900
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:54,415
For us, it is a big part of our future.

901
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:59,818
And making really unique, weird engine decisions,

902
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:03,601
and then allowing that to dictate a cascade of problems,

903
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,703
it's cool for me to be able to stand up and say

904
00:51:06,883 --> 00:51:08,764
to talented people like yourselves

905
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:11,385
that we're looking for that kind of thing.

906
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:14,207
And we want to continue going forward

907
00:51:14,247 --> 00:51:15,848
making new impactful technology.

908
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:18,830
We know how hard it is to make games.

909
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:25,244
I personally, you know, had to break into the industry and that was hard.

910
00:51:25,664 --> 00:51:30,205
Then I worked on some AAA games and that was really hard. That was like the hardest thing

911
00:51:30,226 --> 00:51:34,907
I'd done in my life and so stressful, something that you care about so creatively, to work on it

912
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:41,389
and to finish it. It's a really intense experience. Then I started a company.

913
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:46,372
and had the additional bonus of running out of money

914
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:50,154
and having to finish under those horrible constraints

915
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:52,476
and making sometimes bad decisions,

916
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:55,739
sometimes good decisions because you have to

917
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,781
because of money constraints and funds and things like that.

918
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:00,963
And then I know what it's like on top of that

919
00:52:01,003 --> 00:52:04,265
with No Man's Sky to do something new and weird

920
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:05,686
and experimental on top.

921
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:12,783
of, you know, also running out of money and also trying to finish something you care about

922
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:14,684
really creatively.

923
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:21,949
So if you are, like, interested in working on stuff like that, then great.

924
00:52:22,629 --> 00:52:26,532
But let's say you're interested in working on that kind of thing, but you also want to

925
00:52:26,592 --> 00:52:30,574
start up and do your own thing, then we're going to try and help with that a little bit

926
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:30,894
as well.

927
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:36,084
So we're starting this thing, it's super low-key at the moment, but it's HelloLabs.

928
00:52:37,225 --> 00:52:39,868
And we're going to try and fund and support a couple of projects.

929
00:52:39,928 --> 00:52:41,349
We've won already in development.

930
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,932
And the focus is going to be on procedural generation.

931
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:47,454
And kind of experimental games.

932
00:52:48,475 --> 00:52:50,036
Games research, that kind of thing.

933
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:52,739
More details will follow, but if you were there

934
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,781
and this is the kind of area that you're interested in,

935
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,724
we would love to help people.

936
00:52:59,665 --> 00:53:04,409
avoid some of the pains that we went through ourselves, kind of thing.

937
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:06,491
It's something I care really passionately about.

938
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:13,576
So, that's my talk.

939
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:17,139
If you're interested, come and mail me.

940
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:22,174
flew in, I now run and fly out.

941
00:53:22,354 --> 00:53:24,534
I'm not doing questions and stuff like that,

942
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:26,935
but you've got the email addresses,

943
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:29,735
and I will hopefully try and be out

944
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:31,576
in one of the break rooms later

945
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:33,116
if people have questions and stuff.

946
00:53:33,536 --> 00:53:37,517
And I'll let everyone leave, finish up their GDC day.

947
00:53:37,537 --> 00:53:39,198
I'm sure you're sick of people talking.

948
00:53:39,978 --> 00:53:40,318
Thank you.
