1
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:09,631
Awesome.

2
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:09,851
Thank you.

3
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,631
Awesome.

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:10,931
Awesome.

5
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:11,031
Okay.

6
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:11,651
Hello everybody.

7
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:12,712
Thank you all for coming.

8
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:16,393
Yeah, so let's just start off with a couple of thanks here

9
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:18,053
to get it rolling.

10
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:19,933
If the slides work.

11
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:20,513
There we go.

12
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:21,154
Awesome.

13
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,774
Firstly, I want to say thank you to GDC for inviting me.

14
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,675
Thank you to the organizers of the Indie Summit

15
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,215
for putting this whole thing on

16
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:28,435
and finding such great speakers.

17
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:30,116
Kate Compton's talk last one,

18
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:31,516
if you saw it, that was amazing.

19
00:00:32,977 --> 00:00:34,938
So I want to say hi, I'm Matter.

20
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm a professor, as mentioned,

21
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,741
from NHTV University in the Netherlands.

22
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,202
It's an awesome place to study.

23
00:00:40,242 --> 00:00:41,943
If you want to learn about video games in Europe,

24
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:43,284
you should be going there.

25
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:44,745
I'm a games developer.

26
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,606
I ran my own company called Matterzone

27
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:48,728
for seven years as an indie developer.

28
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,650
I made games for myself, for the web,

29
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,952
for friends, and for companies like MTV2 and Channel 4.

30
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,374
After that I went to join people like EA and Rebellion,

31
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:01,995
working on a few different titles for them,

32
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:05,015
where I was a writer, narrative designer,

33
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:06,876
lead designer in the very end,

34
00:01:06,896 --> 00:01:09,657
before I went off to work on other things.

35
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:13,298
Most recently I released Fragments of Him last year

36
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,599
on Xbox One and PC in collaboration

37
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,479
with an awesome couple of guys at a studio called Sassy Bot.

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,400
So that's an emotional storytelling kind of game.

39
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:26,781
It was nominated for the best writing in a video game by the Writers Guild of Great Britain,

40
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:30,706
where since I'm now a full member and a member of the video game committee.

41
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,970
I also consult and train people in narrative design.

42
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,994
I do more stuff, I'm writing books about...

43
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:39,816
Anyway, I basically do game stuff,

44
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:41,958
and I have done for my entire adult life.

45
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,259
So I'm going to be talking to you today

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,561
about why understanding story structures

47
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:48,623
is a useful skill for games developers.

48
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,344
And often it's actually something

49
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:52,125
which is already done intuitively.

50
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,567
So that's one of the interesting things about this,

51
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:55,768
that a lot of stuff that I'm going to say,

52
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:58,770
you can go, oh yeah, we kind of already do some of that.

53
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,512
It's a way of me moving that into kind of a conscious realm.

54
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,708
We're gonna look at a reliable storytelling structure

55
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:08,069
that you can use, which will help you tell stories.

56
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,771
And some debug questions to help you fix stories

57
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,431
or gameplay that feels unrewarding.

58
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:15,533
There's gonna be two takeaway diagrams

59
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:16,994
at the very, very end of this session.

60
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,915
So after I've said thank you at the very, very end,

61
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,577
there'll be two pictures which you can take a photo of,

62
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:23,578
and it'll give you loads of summary information

63
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:24,999
about the things I've been saying today.

64
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,800
So we're gonna talk about how to build those,

65
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,421
and there's a nice, easy takeaway for you

66
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,382
if you wanna bring up a camera right at the end there.

67
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,493
This is a lot to cover, so I'm going to be talking fast.

68
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,434
The key points are going to be on the screen behind me.

69
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:37,915
I have an English accent.

70
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,936
Not all of you are native English speakers,

71
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,878
so if you can't follow too easily,

72
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:43,799
if you look at the screen,

73
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,299
you're going to get all the main points as we go.

74
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,763
So let's start off talking a little bit about flowing games.

75
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,004
This is something that we all understand is important.

76
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:55,006
We usually express this as a diagram

77
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,827
where we've got challenge on one and skill on the other.

78
00:02:57,308 --> 00:03:00,289
And if it's got very low skill, sorry,

79
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,391
very high skill requirement but low challenge,

80
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,172
then a game becomes quite boring.

81
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:07,814
And if it's got a low skill but high challenge,

82
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,075
then the game becomes too difficult.

83
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,356
It makes players really anxious.

84
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,379
So we decide really that we should try and keep people

85
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,120
what's called the flow channel.

86
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,583
Now we started off thinking that this was kind of a

87
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:20,165
straight line, that challenge and skills should escalate

88
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:22,087
in perfect relationship to each other.

89
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:24,529
But we've discovered really that it's kind of more fun

90
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,673
if it's kind of wavy, wobbly line as we go along there.

91
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:32,115
Now if you want to learn more about Flow, there's some great people you can read up on.

92
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:34,797
Jenova Chen, Jesse Schell, Mihaly Cixen.

93
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,819
He was the kind of guy who came up with a lot of this stuff.

94
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,882
Tricky one to search for, just go Mihaly and Flow, it'll come out fine in Google.

95
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,204
These people have done amazing work on Flow. Look it up.

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,741
Now, when we think about storytelling and tension,

97
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,981
we also can express this as a diagram, and we often do.

98
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:56,262
So we often have tension along one side

99
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,742
and time going along the bottom there

100
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,563
from zero to 100% of our story.

101
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:03,403
And as we go through, we have the inciting incident,

102
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,544
which is that first peak.

103
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:06,864
We have a low midpoint where things have got worse

104
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,685
unexpectedly when we tried to fix them.

105
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,145
We have that final, what's called the black moment

106
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,106
in writing, where there's this moment

107
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,946
of the greatest darkness threatens us,

108
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:16,366
and then we eventually overcome it,

109
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,167
which is the end of our story.

110
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:22,832
story. Now it's actually generally slightly more sort of knobbly than that

111
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:26,736
and I'll explain why it's a bit more knobbly than that later on but as

112
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:29,338
you can see when we could kind of compare these two ideas together we see

113
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:33,122
that there's still this thing there that if a lot of times gone along and no

114
00:04:33,222 --> 00:04:37,446
tension happened then it's quite boring and if there's a really high tension and

115
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,669
not a lot of times passed then it feels too tense it doesn't feel natural.

116
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:44,289
And so we can see there's kind of this combination of the two

117
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:46,631
that we have these things that go in common between them.

118
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:50,535
But really, what does that kind of wobbly line

119
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:51,596
actually represent?

120
00:04:52,356 --> 00:04:54,058
What is this thing when we talk about games?

121
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:56,160
What is this thing going on here?

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,941
Now, when we think about this, we

123
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,063
could think about what is the story of your game?

124
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:06,034
Now, we kind of go, well, your game has things that we might call pre-authored content.

125
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:13,318
So this is things like events and content, the storytelling, the mechanics, the world that it's in.

126
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,920
These are things that we put into our games to tell the stories of them.

127
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:19,716
On the other hand, we've got our players.

128
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:23,217
Awesome, huge bunch of people, all of them playing,

129
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,277
having fun with this kind of stuff.

130
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:26,918
We could call this a user-generated version of the story.

131
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,199
This is their interaction with the world,

132
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,100
and it's their interpretation of the world.

133
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,760
Because the world that we design

134
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,401
might not be the world that they see,

135
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:36,002
because they interpret things differently

136
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,142
based on their experiences of playing games

137
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:39,303
and the world around them.

138
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,956
So between the two of these, we might get different things.

139
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,838
So imagine we've got a world which has a car in it

140
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:47,639
on a racetrack and it's in the middle of a city,

141
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,420
well we've already got a narrative setting there.

142
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,961
We know about cars, we know about cities.

143
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:54,563
And it starts off the race and there's this back and forth

144
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:57,225
between you and a rival and then on the final bend

145
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,826
is coming up and the rival's just ahead

146
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,188
and that final corner, the rival doesn't drive

147
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,569
particularly well and you manage to take it on the inside.

148
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,051
Fantastic excitement, lovely little story

149
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,213
encapsulated in that moment there.

150
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:12,542
That's a tiny little story within a game.

151
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,563
And we can see that whether we think about tension

152
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,504
in stories or whether we think of this as flow,

153
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:19,664
this is basically a story.

154
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:23,466
These two lines fit with this experience over here.

155
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,586
Now, as developers, we shaped that.

156
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,767
through the AI, maybe we did rubber banding on the AI to make sure that

157
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:34,228
that opponent was close on that final bend but stupid enough to crash just as

158
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,429
we were taking past it there. We changed it with a track design to

159
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,229
make sure that it was fun, that there was going to be straights and

160
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:44,330
corners that felt exciting and built in this rhythm of a story as you

161
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,951
played. And from a player's perspective, well they were using their skill,

162
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:51,212
their choices, their ways of controlling the corners

163
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,192
to create that story for themselves.

164
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,736
So these two things have basically

165
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,718
created the player experience between them.

166
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,941
This line, this story that they've created,

167
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:06,265
this wobbly line is basically the place between these.

168
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:09,449
And ideally, that's the thing that we make

169
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:10,570
as games developers.

170
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,133
We create that experience, we create that space for it,

171
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,015
and we help our users get to that point.

172
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,337
So how do we do this kind of stuff?

173
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:23,255
So flow theory says that it's good to keep players in that flow channel.

174
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,555
We know that that's a good place to keep them.

175
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,056
But how do we do this?

176
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,916
Well, there's lots of other ideas out there based on mechanics.

177
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:33,957
But storytellers have structured systems that they've been reliably using

178
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:37,317
to create great audience experiences for millennia.

179
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,018
So rather than perhaps reinvent the wheel for understanding a player experience,

180
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:45,139
we can learn a lot from storytellers in how they shape experiences,

181
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,459
how they guide the emotional journey the players go on.

182
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:50,529
So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna build in

183
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,311
a diagram which covers the basics of storytelling.

184
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,693
We're gonna have a little bit of stuff about motivations,

185
00:07:57,713 --> 00:07:59,335
we're gonna have some stuff about scene structure,

186
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,216
and a lot of it is gonna be about a flow

187
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:02,056
from beginning to end.

188
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:03,757
Mostly covering from zero to 100%,

189
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:06,079
with a little bit more and a little bit at the end.

190
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,200
This whole diagram will be shown

191
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,081
at the very, very end of this slide,

192
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,182
so you don't need to take photos

193
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:12,383
progressively as we go, by the way,

194
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:13,524
unless you want to.

195
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:16,285
And I'm also gonna be filling in some information

196
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:17,766
about what happens at each juncture there.

197
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:21,037
So let's start off talking about motivations.

198
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,241
This is a really key part of telling a good story.

199
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:27,879
So for characters, these are divided between external

200
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,160
and internal motivations.

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,081
An external motivation is the desire to change something

202
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:33,361
in the world outside you.

203
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,102
So this is often to get richer,

204
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,084
to steal some money from a bank,

205
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,485
or become rich and famous through doing a particular thing.

206
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,725
That's a very common external motivation.

207
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,706
It changes your status in the outside world.

208
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,247
Another one is to travel.

209
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,947
You want to reach to a certain place,

210
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,368
you want to explore a new area.

211
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:54,510
That's a change in your status in terms of your location.

212
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,019
Forming friendships and love and relationships

213
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,181
is changing your relationship status.

214
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,762
It's a status in the outside world.

215
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:05,163
Emotions are an internal thing in some ways,

216
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,164
but how they affect the outside world

217
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:08,445
is still an external motivation.

218
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:11,067
So it could be to date the hot guy in the office,

219
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:11,687
for example.

220
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,548
That could be the objective of the game

221
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:14,609
or for your character.

222
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,491
So in terms of motivations here,

223
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:19,632
an internal motivation is a desire

224
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,153
to change something inside the person.

225
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:26,478
This is usually termed like overcoming a problem, so overcome a block.

226
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,123
It's often an emotional block, overcoming a sense of loneliness, overcoming grief.

227
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:37,907
Now, revenge is an external thing because you affect revenge on the outside world.

228
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,730
Overcoming grief is the inside part of that.

229
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,672
You try to overcome grief by killing people in the outside world.

230
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:45,814
That's how a lot of video game plots work.

231
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,847
Another internal motivation is learning something new.

232
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,031
Usually it's something they should have already known.

233
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:55,498
And you can succeed in one and fail in the other.

234
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:58,779
And often when you succeed in external motivation

235
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,240
and fail in internal motivation, you get a tragedy.

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,600
That's Romeo and Juliet.

237
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,141
Two families alike in dignity,

238
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,182
who failed to actually ever come to terms

239
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:11,163
with the fact that they should stop fighting.

240
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,763
And their internal necessity

241
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,764
to learn something new about themselves,

242
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,944
to learn that they're all the same,

243
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,585
to learn to accept their differences.

244
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:23,127
And their failure to do that kills their children.

245
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:25,229
And that's why that's a tragedy.

246
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,591
So learning something new is a huge thing of an internal change there.

247
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:33,034
Now both of these things, like I say, they are about change.

248
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,655
A story is always about change.

249
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,357
A story that doesn't have change from beginning to end

250
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:39,439
is a very, very boring story.

251
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,701
Now it can just be that your character got bigger guns.

252
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:47,832
It's change of a kind, you know, and it works pretty well, it really does.

253
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,736
I'm not putting down games which are just purely about mechanical advancement,

254
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:55,520
that's a lot of fun as well, but there are other things we can do to change internally.

255
00:10:57,142 --> 00:11:01,246
So that change must happen in some kind. But how do we apply all this kind of stuff to games?

256
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:05,151
Well, we might not think of Tetris as a game with the greatest of plots.

257
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,525
but it really does follow these kind of things pretty well.

258
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:11,167
It's a very, very compelling player experience.

259
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:12,347
Now if we think about this,

260
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,768
if we think about the tension arc

261
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,189
that we go through when we're playing this,

262
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,950
it fits that flow thing, it fits that tension arc.

263
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,612
And the player has both external and internal goals.

264
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,633
We have the scores as an external goal,

265
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:23,753
and we have that internal goal,

266
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,654
which is kind of a desire for order.

267
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,796
Tetris is driven by the thing that we like the world

268
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:30,197
to be slightly neater than it is.

269
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:35,109
And this is a tiny place where maybe, just maybe, we'll succeed in making it happen.

270
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,831
And it's always a tragedy, because we always fail.

271
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:44,277
But I think that internal goal is a really powerful part of the lasting appeal of Tetris.

272
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,780
That sense of desiring order and it always chasing away from us.

273
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,125
That's a very human experience, and I think that's one of the reasons it works as such an enduring appeal for us.

274
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:56,634
So if you add that quickly into our diagram there,

275
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,036
we have the external motivation is looking for change,

276
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:01,737
usually expressed through very direct verbs

277
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:03,558
like save and find and things like that.

278
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:06,919
And internal is about overcoming or coming to terms with.

279
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:11,922
So, let's move on to plot structure.

280
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:15,746
You've got your goals for your player character,

281
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,447
your external, internal motivations there.

282
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:19,908
Now we need a well-structured series of events

283
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,269
through which change will happen.

284
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,010
The external goals are just a desire.

285
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,291
We need the plot to make that change happen.

286
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:29,613
So a plot controls the speed of progress

287
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,494
through the tension arc of the experience.

288
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:33,255
And so I'm gonna be talking a little bit more in detail

289
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,296
about how this plot works.

290
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:38,818
So, start your story before the big events begin.

291
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,460
This is one thing that a lot of games fail to do properly.

292
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:46,816
By this I mean you don't start your story with,

293
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:47,636
you're a wizard, Harry.

294
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:51,298
You have this whole part of meeting the Dursleys,

295
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:54,499
you have his childhood, his normal everyday life

296
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,943
outside of the wizard world before you see Hagrid come in,

297
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,764
before you experience the world of magic.

298
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:05,405
Because the world of magic by itself means nothing

299
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:08,126
unless it's contrasted by the world of the ordinary.

300
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:12,497
We see this sometimes in games, and when we do, it's very powerful.

301
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,639
Prince of Persia, Sands of Time is one of my favorite storytelling games.

302
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,721
And it's got a little snatch of normality at the very beginning of it.

303
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,463
It's beautiful, really lovely game.

304
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,325
So you set up your character, the situation, and the basic rules of this.

305
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:26,526
This is otherwise known as a tutorial mission.

306
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:29,448
You can do it that way. You can literally do it.

307
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:30,749
Set it in a normal world.

308
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,211
Call of Duty sometimes does this, that you train on the base

309
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:37,193
before you go and shoot people who are ideologically opposed to you.

310
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:44,353
So you, I wasn't going to do politics.

311
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,195
I said I wouldn't.

312
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:48,437
So start your story before the events begin.

313
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,278
It's really important to build empathy

314
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,500
with your characters if possible.

315
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,962
So we want the character to overcome

316
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:54,903
the challenges ahead of us.

317
00:13:55,283 --> 00:13:57,365
Now a really great example of this I think is Firewatch.

318
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:59,127
I think Firewatch did beautiful work with this.

319
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,309
So before we reach the lake in Firewatch,

320
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:03,271
which is really when the story begins to kick off

321
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,112
and that tension starts.

322
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:08,436
We know a lot about Harry, we know about his external and internal motivations

323
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:12,719
and the story begins with that moment there, that his external motivation is really

324
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,704
kicked off by, there's trouble in this park. So we've got this internal stuff,

325
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,165
that growth, that need to escape

326
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:24,349
and we know at some point he's going to have to go back. It's a nice setup and it makes

327
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,612
the rest the game powerful. If we just started with that confrontation with the

328
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,996
teenage woman, it probably wouldn't work so well.

329
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,479
And then we have what we call the inciting incident.

330
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,861
So now your player character knows their place

331
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,243
in the world, we can start to set up

332
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:40,103
the challenges for them.

333
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:43,046
So we increase the narrative or mechanical tension here,

334
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,288
and we add the antagonist or the enemies,

335
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:48,270
the risk, or we break the usual situation.

336
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,912
Something which was normal and everyday

337
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:51,293
becomes less normal.

338
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:52,494
Suddenly it stops working.

339
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:54,335
See this in the Stanley parable,

340
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,476
the button stops going.

341
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,849
Overcoming this problem is usually the external motivation of your plot.

342
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:05,072
Trying to find the source of that problem and bring it back into normality

343
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,753
is usually what drives your main character.

344
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:11,597
But to begin with, the player character avoids the problem.

345
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,198
The player doesn't usually go straight to attacking the problem,

346
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:17,141
they'll either explore their abilities, explore the world,

347
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:19,482
they'll avoid the big issue that's facing them,

348
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,624
or they'll have some smaller battles along the way.

349
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:26,750
So in VVVVVV, which I shall call Spikes from now on,

350
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,691
so in Spikes, the player character

351
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:29,932
has to rescue their colleagues.

352
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:32,454
It's a really lovely little game.

353
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,215
It reminds me a lot of Jet Set William.

354
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:36,797
It's really a lovely little game, it's very, very fun.

355
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:40,019
But to begin with, basically the player wanders aimlessly.

356
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,960
Really, that's what you do.

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,021
You don't, you're not setting off,

358
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,602
ah, I shall find everybody immediately.

359
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:46,763
No, you go off and play and you see

360
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,204
what the kind of puzzles are in the world.

361
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:52,946
Now after a little while of exploration, they make a choice to act with intention.

362
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,048
After a while the player feels like they know the territory enough to make that

363
00:15:56,328 --> 00:15:59,411
focused choice to act, or there's no choice left but to act.

364
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,893
You've done all the sub-missions, you have to go do a story one.

365
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,397
In Spikes that means basically, I better use the map more.

366
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,149
If you ever play the game, eventually you kind of go,

367
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,209
oh yeah, I'm lost, okay.

368
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,490
What is this flashing elephant?

369
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,271
They engage with the external objective

370
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:18,512
of the story or the world that's ahead of them.

371
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,173
And that's when they really begin to kind of get into this.

372
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:23,334
But as they get further into it,

373
00:16:23,374 --> 00:16:24,695
the complexity begins to increase.

374
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:28,256
The abilities seem less effective, maybe.

375
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,737
New enemies are added, which are more challenging.

376
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,419
New story elements show that things were not so simple

377
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,559
as we thought they were to begin with.

378
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:37,994
And I think Tetris is a masterpiece

379
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,655
because of exactly this moment.

380
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:46,158
Suddenly complexity has increased.

381
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,980
And suddenly we know that there's gonna be

382
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,300
difficulty ahead and we're gonna have to,

383
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,722
our strategy of just piling things on top of each other

384
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,963
is now a strategy of slipping things underneath

385
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,324
just about quickly, move down, oh no.

386
00:16:58,425 --> 00:16:59,745
Suddenly the complexity has increased

387
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:01,586
and this is a storytelling moment in itself.

388
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,569
I think the complexity has to increase to make the experience compelling,

389
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,452
otherwise it stays at this kind of flat level, the tension doesn't change.

390
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:13,117
So that complexity can change through narrative terms, mechanical terms, or through both.

391
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:17,081
I like both, if you can, but you can just do it with narrative.

392
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,665
I think that's a really valid way of doing it, if you're making purely narrative games.

393
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,730
So in Virginia, we see divisions between the protagonists

394
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,352
and the dreams begin to call some of reality into question.

395
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:32,195
And this is a complexification of the everyday setting

396
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:33,155
that we've gone into.

397
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,978
In Firewatch, an extra layer of conspiracy is added.

398
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,460
There's not just missing women,

399
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,041
there's some other stuff going on in the park

400
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,943
and it all gets a bit, ooh, it's cool, I love that game.

401
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,705
In my own game, Fragments of Him,

402
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:46,846
Will's kind of been trying to build

403
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,488
a big long-term relationship and halfway through,

404
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,870
he begins to doubt whether he can stay in a relationship

405
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,931
without hurting other people.

406
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:58,640
It's a big doubtful moment and this is the low midpoint of most stories.

407
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:03,711
So the first strategies and weapons are no longer enough usually.

408
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,694
In shooters, new patterns and combinations of enemies are added.

409
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:10,317
Something like Super Stardust tends to add in new things halfway through.

410
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:13,600
Enemies use better targeting, more bullets or homing missiles.

411
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:19,126
Enemies begin to get dangerous new abilities like moving faster or tracking you.

412
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:23,750
In Left 4 Dead, you would not throw these things at the player as soon as they walk out the door.

413
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:25,828
It's just natural, isn't it?

414
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:26,568
And that's what I mean.

415
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,650
Some of these patterns are intuitive to us.

416
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,591
We just know it wouldn't be a good idea.

417
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,293
Then hope overcomes fear with some effort.

418
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:35,034
Player finds new weapons or strategies

419
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:35,874
to overcome the enemies.

420
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:37,496
The external change happens.

421
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:38,956
They get power-ups or grinding.

422
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:42,079
This is kind of the weapon montage

423
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,399
and the training montage in a film.

424
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,401
They find the strength they never knew they had.

425
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,402
They have that moment of internal change,

426
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,323
which I think Life is Strange does so well

427
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:50,584
with Kate's story.

428
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:55,692
and the character learns to unite their skills and teams behind a single purpose.

429
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,173
It has high risks.

430
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,974
There's danger ahead now. Before it was just fun,

431
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,235
but now there's danger in facing these things.

432
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,216
But it is their only hope to continue.

433
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:07,777
Guns. Lots of guns.

434
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:10,923
And then we get to the black moment.

435
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:13,085
All hopes of overcoming the problem are at risk.

436
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:15,708
The final boss is killed, but it's not even his final form.

437
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:18,310
Oh my God, it's this kind of moment

438
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,512
that the escalating danger seems too much.

439
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,394
And all the knowledge, the relationships,

440
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:23,455
the strategies developed through

441
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:24,516
the player character experience

442
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:27,418
are needed to overcome this final challenge.

443
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:31,322
The final choice, the heartbreaking relationships

444
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:34,224
you've built along the way are all at risk now.

445
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,486
And what choice will you make about the future?

446
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:39,648
It's a powerful moment, the black moment.

447
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,690
Very, very important in your story.

448
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:45,574
And then, you end it as fast as possible.

449
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:47,957
People often say, how long should my ending be?

450
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,899
You say, you do it as quickly as you possibly can.

451
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,721
And you keep the ending neat and short,

452
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:54,044
wrapping up as many of the threads as you possibly can,

453
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,265
as easily as you can.

454
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:58,663
So let's add all of that to our diagram.

455
00:19:58,943 --> 00:19:59,364
Okay.

456
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,907
So we're gonna start off with our before it begins moment.

457
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,949
We get to our inciting incident,

458
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,731
where we kind of have a need for change.

459
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,833
But the character kind of tries to avoid it,

460
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,194
thinks it's somebody else's problem.

461
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:11,775
And then it kind of gets that statement

462
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:12,596
of external objective.

463
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:13,977
Yes, I will face up to this.

464
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:16,920
Yes, I will use the map more and find my colleagues.

465
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,080
They try this, they try these kind of things and it's not really working.

466
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,161
We get to the low midpoint.

467
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:24,541
They're going to have to get better.

468
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:26,842
They're going to have to find new ways of dealing with these kind of things.

469
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:29,723
Training montage, people get to power up,

470
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:32,244
people grind as their characters a little bit more to get the high things.

471
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:34,584
We get some hope entering into the story.

472
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,365
Maybe if I keep on doing this, if I get better at this game,

473
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,546
I'll overcome these challenges.

474
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,959
Then we get to this moment of building up,

475
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:45,160
that everybody assembles behind this one plan

476
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,300
which is gonna push us forward.

477
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,580
When we reach the black moment where all is at risk,

478
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,001
and maybe just with enough skill,

479
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,421
with enough of the things that we saved along the way

480
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,302
we can overcome, and we have the final satisfying conclusion.

481
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,243
Cool, you may have noticed there's a bit missing

482
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:01,063
at the beginning and the end there,

483
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,623
because that's the model for most stories.

484
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,344
As a player's character journey,

485
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:05,924
this fits most strong experiences.

486
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,764
A lot of films you see will follow this model

487
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:08,705
pretty much exactly.

488
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,445
It works on an intuitive and emotional level to feel very rewarding.

489
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:15,888
But if you're making a thriller, an action or a horror story,

490
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,710
you might want to add an extra little bit on there.

491
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,132
Horror stories in particular do this one.

492
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,835
There's an additional bit of structure you might want to consider adding at the very beginning,

493
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:23,796
which is called the grabber.

494
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,499
It's a burst of action or fear that promises future of the game

495
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,481
and slows down before the inciting incident.

496
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:33,945
So it's a way to let the player character know there's going to be excitement ahead

497
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,367
and then you give them a bit of breathing space later on.

498
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:41,310
For example, this is the Metroid games where you end up with loads of great powers at the beginning

499
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,293
and then they take them away and kind of go, okay, let's let you build those up slowly now.

500
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:50,656
Or the Goblet of Fire. It gets a moment of horror at the beginning

501
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:53,378
and you know it's going to have another moment of horror later on.

502
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:56,840
And sure enough, a teenager is killed in cold blood at the very end.

503
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,289
That's a... Spoilers, sorry.

504
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,712
But it's a way of telling us

505
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,973
that there's gonna be something coming along.

506
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,616
Deus Ex does this, with all the abilities at the beginning,

507
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:08,938
takes them away, slower paced a bit after that.

508
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,140
Star Trek, J.J. Abrams.

509
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,982
You've got death, you've got love, you've got birth,

510
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:16,124
you've got sacrifice, you've got amazing stuff,

511
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:17,506
not the first five minutes of the film.

512
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,989
Really, J.J. Abrams is a master of the grab.

513
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,351
It's a very important thing, I think,

514
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:24,452
if you can do that kind of stuff.

515
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:29,350
In horror stories you often also have a final moment of fear at the end, which is called evil lurks.

516
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,732
So in Carrie this is when the hand comes up from beneath the earth and grabs her.

517
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,072
It's the nightmares at the end of Event Horizon.

518
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:42,593
But also you sometimes have this in thrillers where the organization perhaps wasn't quite defeated.

519
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,894
So in Austin Powers, Dr. Evil escapes.

520
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:48,314
This is a fairly common kind of structure that we do with this.

521
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:51,235
Or the end of Killzone 2, where you've killed the big boss.

522
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:54,796
Oh my god, it's brilliant. The war is over, you walk outside and the war is still going.

523
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,887
Oh, Evil Lurks, there'll be a Killzone 3.

524
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,155
So we'll just add those quickly at the beginning

525
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,698
and the end of that structure, there we go.

526
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:10,826
So we've described this so far,

527
00:23:10,866 --> 00:23:12,227
this nice smooth curve in here.

528
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,190
The diagram explains the player character journey

529
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,890
pretty nicely there.

530
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,193
It could be applied literally to help

531
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:18,174
write an in-game story,

532
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:21,157
or as a metaphorical structure to shape tension

533
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:23,320
in a compelling mechanics-driven experience.

534
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,641
Whichever way you want to do it,

535
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,964
this kind of structure works on an emotional way.

536
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,756
So we can also set it out like this.

537
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,098
This model works as a meta-structure for the entire game,

538
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,200
but also you can do it on a smaller level.

539
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,143
It can repeat on a level-by-level basis,

540
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,785
with each little bit of the level

541
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,428
contributing to the journey

542
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,370
towards that external, internal motivation.

543
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,473
This is what I did on Aliens vs. Predator, for example.

544
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,836
Every level of that has a full story inside it,

545
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,158
as well as contributing to the full story of the game.

546
00:23:53,613 --> 00:23:55,696
But that's too much detail for each encounter or scene.

547
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,579
So if you want to make a good scene to work with that,

548
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,541
we need a little simpler, shorter guide for that.

549
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:02,804
Basically, we want to turn this

550
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:04,766
into that kind of knobbly version.

551
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:06,568
So how do we go about doing this?

552
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:07,969
Well, we do this with scene structure.

553
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,703
This is the final part of that diagram we're going to add in there.

554
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:16,247
So all scenes on your level must have an objective, which is the player's target goal or experience.

555
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:20,230
It must have conflict, something that makes the objective more difficult to reach.

556
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,754
This can be either narrative or mechanics or both, some sort of conflict that makes us struggle,

557
00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:27,515
makes it harder for us to make these things happen.

558
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:31,518
And then an outcome is reached by requiring change from the player or the character.

559
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,936
So they either resolve or adapt to the conflict,

560
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:37,697
building to the next part of the experience of the story,

561
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:40,278
and the story goes on with escalating tension there.

562
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,759
And you get these nice little peaks of,

563
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,800
oh, I'm gonna make it, oh no, that wasn't what I expected,

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,161
oh, damn, you get these little tension arcs

565
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,361
coming all the way along the way there.

566
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:50,142
So this was the lead character from Aliens vs Predator,

567
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:51,063
I was the writer on this one.

568
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:57,325
One of the first objectives you get is to reset the colony powers to make it work again.

569
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:03,209
The conflict is the player successfully resets the power, but it blows the circuits across the colony.

570
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:07,151
So the colony is actually more at risk before, and the character's life is more complex.

571
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:11,533
Now notice here that the player succeeded whilst the character failed.

572
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:15,035
So you can still have player success as long as you signpost,

573
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:18,857
well done, you've done the right thing, your player's life now sucks even more.

574
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:21,199
perfectly fine.

575
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,922
In fact, I thoroughly encourage you to do that

576
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:23,984
as often as possible,

577
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:26,087
because if your character's life is easy,

578
00:25:26,428 --> 00:25:28,572
their story is usually pretty boring.

579
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,697
So try and play with this kind of stuff as much as you can.

580
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,961
So another example from this might be God of War series,

581
00:25:37,081 --> 00:25:39,022
where the objective is to continue killing everything.

582
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:41,223
And then you have the conflict,

583
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:42,844
which is he gets enemies with shields,

584
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:44,144
which block the usual attacks.

585
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:47,686
And so the player has to start using new attacks to progress,

586
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,207
making the game more challenging.

587
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:51,068
The complexity increases for the player,

588
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:53,029
the character has not changed.

589
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:54,790
The character just wants to keep on killing everything.

590
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,352
So here we see again that we've got that escalating

591
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,973
little peak and trough in a scene,

592
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:01,674
but it's working the other way around

593
00:26:01,714 --> 00:26:03,895
for the player's complexity this time.

594
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,952
So let's add that in there.

595
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,734
So we have our objective, we have our conflict,

596
00:26:08,794 --> 00:26:09,675
and we have our outcome.

597
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:12,218
This will be on the final slides.

598
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,080
You don't need to go, and I'm gonna change it now.

599
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,801
Ha, too late.

600
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,933
So games are players' stories.

601
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:21,994
So if your game feels flat,

602
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:24,515
then think of your player's experience as a story.

603
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:25,656
It's a good way of debugging it.

604
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,336
Think about what they're experiencing

605
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:28,257
as they're going through it.

606
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,518
So here are four debug questions to ask

607
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,299
that a game, event, or level feels unsatisfying.

608
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:34,780
And I'm gonna put a diagram of this

609
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,881
at the very end as well, okay?

610
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,082
Is the player's objective clear?

611
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:42,983
Is there an escalating mechanical or narrative conflict?

612
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,184
Or is it only repetition?

613
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:45,325
Have we done this before?

614
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,968
Does the outcome meaningfully add to the mechanics,

615
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,048
the narrative, or both?

616
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,109
And over the whole game, was there change

617
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,930
from start to finish for the player, the character, or both?

618
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,791
That change is a really key thing

619
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,272
to making your game experience feel good.

620
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,033
Really, really important thing.

621
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:06,714
So I'm just gonna conclude this,

622
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:07,974
wrapping this all up now.

623
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:11,875
Good designers already intuitively use story structures

624
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:13,796
to create compelling and rewarding games.

625
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:16,884
Learning to do so consciously, though,

626
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,626
I think is a powerful way of understanding

627
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,508
how we shape great experiences.

628
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:22,430
Using stories consciously,

629
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,832
understanding this tension arc that people go through,

630
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,014
that it is peaks and troughs, not a straight line,

631
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:28,296
is a really important thing to do.

632
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:31,079
So whether your game is narrative or mechanics oriented,

633
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:32,760
learning to think like a storyteller

634
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:35,563
helps you make intelligent, player-focused design choices.

635
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:38,773
I hope you found this talk interesting and useful.

636
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:40,133
Get in touch if you want to know more.

637
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:42,994
Please leave comments with a view after the session.

638
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,575
I do read all the comments you put in there.

639
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:45,395
Those are awesome.

640
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:48,496
So I'm going to show those two diagrams after the next slide.

641
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:49,817
So I'm going to say thank you one,

642
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:50,917
then I'll show the two diagrams.

643
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:53,038
Then we can all take photos and stuff like that.

644
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,380
Before that, I want to just say have fun, make great games,

645
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,700
and please tell some great stories.

646
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,581
And thank you so much for listening.

647
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:02,101
29 minutes, 15 seconds.

648
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:02,361
Woo-hoo!

649
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:02,561
Thank you.

650
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:10,659
Thank you.

651
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,340
Right.

652
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,742
Let's do the camera bit.

653
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:16,763
Here we go.

654
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:19,344
I love this bit.

655
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:20,965
I see about 200 cameras come up.

656
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:21,465
It's great.

657
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,530
I should get my camera out and take a photo of you.

658
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,751
Everybody who just took a photo,

659
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:32,852
hold your camera in the air.

660
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:35,933
Awesome.

661
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:36,734
Thank you.

662
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:39,255
Okay, let's do the next one.

663
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,108
There we go, some scene debugging questions for you,

664
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:42,888
just to help you through there.

665
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:44,828
Some tips about how to use them,

666
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:46,848
kind of what sort of things are probably causing you problems

667
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:49,709
if you don't get a good answer

668
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:50,949
to those questions for yourself.

669
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,270
Cool, okay.

670
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,690
Do we have time for questions

671
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,230
or do we have to wrap up right now?

672
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:58,711
I think we probably have to wrap up.

673
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:01,451
There is a wrap up room which is 2022.

674
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:07,172
I think they said 2022, is that correct?

675
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:08,813
It is correct, excellent.

676
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,691
Everybody, thank you so, so much for being here.

677
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:13,853
I hope you enjoyed that talk.

678
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:14,635
Thank you once again.

679
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:15,757
Thank you.

680
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,101
Thank you.

681
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:18,301
Thank you.

682
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:18,502
Thank you.
