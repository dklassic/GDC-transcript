Hey, I'm Diana and I'm from Mytona.

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:04,254
We are game developers and publishers.

3
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:08,778
I'm sure you know that Japan is one of the most lucrative markets in mobile gaming

4
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:14,523
and any developer or publisher would like to see themselves in the top grossing chart of this amazing country.

5
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:17,025
Wouldn't like to have a piece of delicious pie, right?

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,528
But when we take a look in the top grossing chart list,

7
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,452
we see that the majority of games have really cute and anime style.

8
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:27,855
Back in the days, when we were entering this specific market,

9
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:35,859
We did a lot of research on how to make culturalization, localization, and we didn't have any practical example, unfortunately.

10
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,541
So, I have really good news for you guys.

11
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:45,204
After long months of developing the process, we made a full culturalization for our game Seekers' Notes Hidden Mystery.

12
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:49,387
And I'll be really happy to share with you this unique experience from start to launch.

13
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:53,409
And more importantly, I'll be sharing with you the AB test results.

14
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:56,571
So, please come and join me at my talk.
