1
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:08,884
First of all, thanks a lot for coming along to my talk.

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,865
Thanks once again to Lee Petty for the opportunity

3
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:12,747
to come here and speak at GDC,

4
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:16,330
talk about some stuff that I've learned.

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,233
Don't forget to fill out the questionnaire at the end

6
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,316
and remember to silence your phones.

7
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:27,119
Okay, so just over two years ago, I got into photography

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,061
and that journey has been something that,

9
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,142
it's been like one of the biggest learning experiences

10
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:31,383
for me.

11
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,485
one to help me kind of grow as an artist,

12
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:36,545
one to help me get out of my comfort zone.

13
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:40,467
And in that process, I learned about art,

14
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,968
about art direction, the technical side,

15
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:44,788
and also things like marketing.

16
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:47,289
And I really became curious how far I could push that.

17
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:49,450
And that's kind of what I'm gonna talk about today.

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,971
When I think back to when I was a kid,

19
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:54,311
I was 10 years old, and I really wanted to be a game designer.

20
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:57,909
and my favorite game was Commandos Behind Enemy Lines

21
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,050
and I wanted to work for Eidos,

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,610
I would have killed someone for a job there.

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,871
I wanted to live on the moon

24
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,472
and I think I had like at least have a futuristic sports car

25
00:01:05,472 --> 00:01:07,452
which is pretty ambitious.

26
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:11,714
But by 18, like that dream was just gone and dead

27
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:15,095
and I really didn't know what I wanted to do.

28
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:16,335
So I had this kind of high school report

29
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:19,056
that basically said I was struggling in class

30
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:21,297
and like I was just super quiet.

31
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:25,864
And so I took a year after high school

32
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,666
because I really didn't know what I wanted to do.

33
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,466
I felt kind of lost,

34
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:31,469
and it turned to video games as a way to escape.

35
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:33,510
And so I played like so much World of Warcraft,

36
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,793
and it really helped build my confidence in a weird way.

37
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:42,577
It taught me about communication, teamwork, and leadership.

38
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:44,519
And I would lead, my words,

39
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:48,121
I would lead raids of like 40 people

40
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:49,923
and sitting in my bedroom when in reality

41
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,584
I couldn't even talk to someone face to face.

42
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,187
So slowly over that year that I took out,

43
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,168
it helped me build my confidence.

44
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,268
And since then, and even now,

45
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,668
these are the three things that have helped me

46
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:00,629
get out of my comfort zone.

47
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:03,749
The first is learning something new.

48
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,329
The second is putting myself out there.

49
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,310
And the third point is surrounding myself with talent.

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,671
And these are the things that helped me

51
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,391
land my job at Ubisoft.

52
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:17,512
And when I joined, I was the youngest director, age 25.

53
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,592
And what I focus on in my day job is visual identity.

54
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:23,605
So my job is to kind of interpret what game is

55
00:02:23,605 --> 00:02:25,326
and translate that into visuals

56
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,767
so that they're unique, memorable, identifiable.

57
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:31,088
So essentially branding the games,

58
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:33,009
creating the logos, motion graphics,

59
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:33,829
anything that relates to the style.

60
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:36,630
And so I knew that at the time,

61
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,912
like throughout my career in the kind of year by year,

62
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,713
I've just slowly been trying to push myself

63
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:44,133
out of my comfort zone.

64
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,213
This is my third GDC talk.

65
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,374
And to do that, I knew I had to like

66
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:48,335
put myself in the deep end.

67
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,870
And when we learn something new,

68
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,951
it's incredibly daunting.

69
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,091
We don't know anything when we start.

70
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:57,512
And it's, sorry one sec,

71
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:03,774
artistically, creatively, we try and think of things

72
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:04,814
that can help push us forward.

73
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:07,215
So for me, that one thing that I'll talk about today

74
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:07,795
is my photography.

75
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:13,065
So believe it or not, these are actually the first photographs I ever shared online.

76
00:03:13,065 --> 00:03:16,508
It was kind of funny because it's the thing I love about photography.

77
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:21,113
We take pictures of stuff we care about. I just happen to love dogs.

78
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:25,477
And when I started taking pictures on my iPhone and when I started to travel,

79
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:28,100
I moved from Scotland, then to England, and then to Canada.

80
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:33,190
I would start to travel a lot and I never really left my hometown.

81
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,651
So I started to just take pictures on my iPhone.

82
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:38,092
Never really shared them and I kept a private Instagram where I think

83
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,933
I had like 10 people, I think one of them's here.

84
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:44,515
So a very small audience and that's because I just felt this fear,

85
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:47,116
these anxieties of like, well you know,

86
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:49,517
they're not like great photos, they're not anything special.

87
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:52,798
And, but I was like, spending my life

88
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,819
and enjoying it. And so everywhere I'd go,

89
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,640
the biggest learning experience was understanding.

90
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:03,037
how the architecture, just how the cities in general

91
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:06,518
had like different moods and different vibes.

92
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:10,138
So I'd go to places like LA for E3, do press stuff.

93
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:11,979
And yeah, just a huge, important learning experience.

94
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,699
And as I got more and more into learning stuff,

95
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,880
all of my shots on my iPhone,

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,561
I would just take my iPhone everywhere

97
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,201
and every day I would just start taking pictures.

98
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,562
And the more and more I learned,

99
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,862
the more and more I wanted to get better at it.

100
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:29,899
So I started to think about composition, symmetry,

101
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,521
just trying to find nice visual shapes in architecture

102
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:33,862
or things that I'd seen.

103
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:36,404
And I just got really addicted to it.

104
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:39,947
But at some point I hit a plateau,

105
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,790
because I'm an iPhone and I can only ever take a picture

106
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,652
of what's in front of me.

107
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,234
And I wanted to push that further,

108
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,115
so I ended up leveling up.

109
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,686
And so after I finished up a game at work,

110
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:58,429
I saved up for a little vacation to Tokyo.

111
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:01,392
And I bought myself a DSLR because I found myself

112
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,314
getting more serious about what I wanted to learn

113
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:04,836
and maybe the artistic stuff

114
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,157
that I could learn along the way.

115
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:07,678
That's where I was like, you know,

116
00:05:07,678 --> 00:05:09,200
how far can I really push this?

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,322
And in the end, like I learned so much

118
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,763
about just art direction in general.

119
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:16,409
One of the first learnings I thought was,

120
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,012
when I think back to when I was a kid,

121
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:20,175
I just, I would freeze up when people were behind me

122
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:20,775
when I was drawing.

123
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:22,378
When I was at university,

124
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:24,180
I would just like minimize all of my windows

125
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,283
because I was ashamed of the art that I was creating.

126
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,987
And it was really photography that pulled me out of that.

127
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,255
So the question I would ask is,

128
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:33,995
we spend so much time on our art,

129
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,117
whether it's a game or maybe it's your music,

130
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:39,478
any of this stuff, and how much time do we actually spend

131
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:40,639
making sure that people see it?

132
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,720
Because to me, at the end of the day,

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,261
it's about creating art that connects with people,

134
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,902
and we get to share our vision and the stuff we care about.

135
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:52,304
And it wasn't really until I captured this one image that I...

136
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,748
my mentality changed, because every picture

137
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,190
that I'd taken before was merely just like

138
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,852
documenting places I'd seen, stuff I'd ate,

139
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:04,034
dogs that I saw, and I put this on my personal Facebook

140
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:06,496
account, and I had like, I don't know how many friends,

141
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,137
a hundred friends, five of them were like,

142
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,458
hey, that's a pretty cool shot,

143
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,460
you should take more pictures, and it really helped me

144
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,841
like, break out of that comfort zone.

145
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,714
And so from there it was like, it's a real turning point.

146
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:21,036
So there's this taxi driver in Shinjuku in Tokyo,

147
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,978
just happened to take the picture,

148
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:25,280
the composition's there,

149
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,323
the guy's face just happens to be lit correctly,

150
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:29,304
and I was like, you know what,

151
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:32,146
I'm gonna go out every day after that, every night,

152
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,247
and try and find these moments.

153
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:36,410
And so each day I had left of my vacation,

154
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,011
I just went out and I took different pictures

155
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,114
and I would post them on my Facebook.

156
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,315
And at some point I started to think like,

157
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,156
oh, okay, maybe I can...

158
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,390
branch out a little bit, go a bit further

159
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,572
out of my comfort zone.

160
00:06:48,572 --> 00:06:51,474
All the while, like, realizing that I was taking pictures

161
00:06:51,474 --> 00:06:53,076
of stuff like signage, typography,

162
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:55,298
the stuff that I was used to dealing with

163
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,379
on a day-to-day basis.

164
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,162
And then, this image stood out in particular,

165
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:03,565
and I sent it off to Smithsonian's Photo Competition,

166
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:05,047
and it became a finalist, 2016.

167
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,440
And so two years on, when I look back at this image,

168
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,700
all I can see are the flaws.

169
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,021
So it's that idea of progress.

170
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,841
You know, I go from just taking regular pictures

171
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:16,082
to suddenly, like, ah, photography's really something

172
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:18,123
that's driving me.

173
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:19,804
The funny thing is, I shot this picture in auto

174
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:22,625
because I didn't know how to use my camera,

175
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,725
even though it was a pretty good DSLR.

176
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,326
And I shot the image in JPEG instead of RAW

177
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:28,967
because I really didn't know my camera.

178
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,208
I literally got it the week before.

179
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,728
The man's out of focus, there's blurring in the image,

180
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,509
the composition's slightly off.

181
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:41,350
And it was actually, my first GDC talk was March,

182
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,313
so like 2016, and I just came back,

183
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:46,055
I did my first talk, and I felt kind of like,

184
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,397
I don't know, like a little bit of a buzz,

185
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:48,418
and so I was like, you know what,

186
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:49,439
I'm gonna put my work out there,

187
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,720
because I spoke to people randomly.

188
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,843
At this point, no one had seen my stuff,

189
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:55,305
and so I sent it off to Kotaku,

190
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:57,528
just because people encouraged me to do that.

191
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:00,493
And one of the biggest learnings I think about

192
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:02,214
in my day job, actually, what I focus on

193
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,916
is really marketing art, or like something

194
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,077
that's gonna summarize what a game is

195
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,938
so people remember it and it's identifiable.

196
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,600
One of the key points I would give off to someone

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,002
would be to create a press release.

198
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,222
As artists, developers, whatnot,

199
00:08:15,222 --> 00:08:17,404
we already have this body of work

200
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:18,564
that we're just kind of sitting on,

201
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:22,527
and I go into that mentality of just like,

202
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,928
why not just put it out there?

203
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:26,349
So gather like five or 10 images of the stuff you have,

204
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,710
write a little bio about yourself,

205
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:32,394
and a little description about what the work is,

206
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:33,075
and include your links.

207
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:36,297
Best case scenario, someone is gonna share that,

208
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:39,158
and it's gonna go further than your own network.

209
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,379
Worst case scenario, nobody replies,

210
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,900
but you already have that work,

211
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,802
so you just send off the email and see where it goes.

212
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:51,625
And then it went online, and over that period of the year,

213
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,406
went up on all these websites.

214
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:59,505
Which is crazy because it was just a vacation picture that I took that kind of inspired me to keep taking more and more.

215
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:08,131
And so at this point, I did my vacation, whatever, went back to my day job and I wanted to get better at photography.

216
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:15,176
So I started taking photos every day, slowly and surely, learning more about how to operate the camera, learning more about the technical side.

217
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,930
If I was at work, I'd go out on my lunch break

218
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,831
and just go with other people who were photographers.

219
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,993
They would teach me all of the different ins and outs

220
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:24,634
of how the camera functioned.

221
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,954
On my weekends, I would go out at night

222
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,575
and just practice, practice, practice.

223
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:28,996
Even when it comes to events like this,

224
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,817
I'll message people and say,

225
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,099
hey, does anyone wanna go take pictures?

226
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,421
So I set myself little mini tasks to make it manageable.

227
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,162
Maybe it was how to capture movement, how to freeze time,

228
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,443
how to get closer to subjects,

229
00:09:40,443 --> 00:09:43,265
because as someone who's kind of awkward,

230
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:43,725
I just never did it.

231
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:48,108
And to do that, I knew I needed to level up my gear,

232
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,609
so I reached out to Canon, and they were able to loan me

233
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:51,650
a bunch of different stuff.

234
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,652
So I thought about the areas I was lacking,

235
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,873
and just so that I could become more comfortable

236
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:58,774
with those kind of things.

237
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:02,295
And I keep training my eye, like simple shapes,

238
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:03,216
symmetry, that kind of thing.

239
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,113
And at some point I realized I had all of this knowledge

240
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,794
that I already had within my comfort zone,

241
00:10:07,794 --> 00:10:10,056
which was directing style guides,

242
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,417
being able to do different styles

243
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,259
for different games or products,

244
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,500
and I wanted to apply that to my photography.

245
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,303
So I looked back at the things I was inspired by,

246
00:10:18,303 --> 00:10:19,964
whether it was Akira, Ghost in the Shell,

247
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:22,066
Blade Runner, Enter the Void,

248
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:23,967
and at the time I'd never really seen photography

249
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,548
pushed to that kind of level,

250
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:28,130
because it was the point where I saw my photography

251
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,312
less like documenting stuff and more like art.

252
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:35,044
So leaning on my skills in graphic design style guides,

253
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:38,704
I thought about the use of color, composition, content,

254
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,085
in a way to make it consistent, to be distinctive,

255
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,525
and so that people would remember it.

256
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,906
And so I'd have more and more pictures where,

257
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:48,427
I was thinking about silhouettes, composition.

258
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,288
The thing about photography is talking about patience,

259
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:52,408
like waiting for the right shot.

260
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,648
Randomly these two people happen to go by,

261
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,809
and they're like 50-50 split right down the middle,

262
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,030
the guy and the girl, the umbrellas,

263
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,010
and I was like, there was this kind of stuff

264
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,770
that was just driving me.

265
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,478
Other times I'd get a bit more creative

266
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,119
because I was learning about the technical side

267
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:08,159
and I would get flashes with gels

268
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,260
and I would just place them in the streets

269
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,621
and kind of wait at the end and take the shot.

270
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:16,283
Almost like setting up my own little fashion shoot

271
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:17,744
on the street, which I never really,

272
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:18,804
I don't think people do that.

273
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,145
So other times I'll just capture moments

274
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,606
thinking about my composition,

275
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:23,846
nice clean lines and whatnot.

276
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:26,127
And so these are just images and images.

277
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:30,467
So then, at some point I started just tagging

278
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,567
different musicians or directors,

279
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,908
songs I was inspired by, and through that,

280
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:37,008
I was able to kind of, I don't know,

281
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:39,569
share my work and have people who like the stuff

282
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,809
I was into also get behind it.

283
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,109
Things like, if you think about art direction,

284
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:47,530
we think about choosing the right silhouette,

285
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,711
even if it was doing logos or it was doing concept art,

286
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,671
I was able to kind of look through all my thumbnails

287
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,872
and figure out what was it about the image

288
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:57,642
would work.

289
00:11:57,642 --> 00:12:00,484
And I posted the image on the right,

290
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:02,265
and I actually took about 2,000 different images

291
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:05,647
on the first half to get to this one image.

292
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:08,489
And I cropped out the stuff that was maybe

293
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,410
not in the same fantasy of like cyberpunk

294
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,012
or these kind of saturated visuals,

295
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,113
and I darkened down the silhouette

296
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,894
because I studied a lot of Roger Dean,

297
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,395
not Roger Dean, Roger Dean's sci-fi,

298
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,937
Blade Runner stuff.

299
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,621
And I was able to turn a camera around and readjust myself,

300
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,743
reposition myself, whilst learning

301
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:28,523
all of these new skills.

302
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:33,587
And then at some point, I started to just play with color,

303
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,169
play with mood, realizing that I was capturing some moments that

304
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:39,351
were kind of isolated and whatnot.

305
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:41,092
I'd bring in the audio to link the people,

306
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:43,754
and then I would also just think about what

307
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,495
it was I wanted to communicate, using color to do that.

308
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:47,937
And this is all the stuff that I was doing in my day job.

309
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,259
So again, I was randomly in Tokyo

310
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,000
and I saw this place just outside of Tokyo,

311
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,741
which was, it just looked like Midgar from Final Fantasy VII,

312
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,602
and I posted on Twitter, and then a bunch

313
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:00,542
of Final Fantasy fans and stuff looked at it.

314
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,863
And so all the while remembering

315
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:04,404
that I never really put my stuff out there,

316
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:07,104
and suddenly I have this confidence,

317
00:13:07,104 --> 00:13:09,465
slowly by slowly, to kind of level it up.

318
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,131
And this was one of the more recent pictures I posted.

319
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:18,394
And actually at the time, I looked at classic Blade Runner.

320
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:19,936
I was trying to deconstruct what they did

321
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,318
with their color palette.

322
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,779
And there was one shot in particular

323
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,801
that I kind of wanted to match the feel of.

324
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,943
And so going from like,

325
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,785
I want to learn a new skill to,

326
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:33,807
here's putting my stuff out there, bringing me out,

327
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:35,789
being able to share my work.

328
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:39,332
One of the things I realized that held me back was,

329
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:42,059
all of the stuff I wanted to learn.

330
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,300
And being able to get to that stage,

331
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,801
I knew that the only way to do it

332
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,983
was to surround myself with people who knew it best.

333
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:53,048
And so, again, I just wanted to see

334
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,149
how far I could take that.

335
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:57,092
And I started reaching out to different people

336
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,993
because really what I wanted to learn about was portraiture.

337
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:01,456
When you do street photography, it's quite like a,

338
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:04,498
you know, it's like just me by myself,

339
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,760
often at night or whatnot, going around by myself.

340
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,089
And the thing I always struggled with was confidence,

341
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:11,550
like face-to-face communication,

342
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,371
especially the anxiety that I would feel

343
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,253
of just meeting somebody new for the first time.

344
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:19,615
And so I sent off all these different emails

345
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:21,857
ahead of the next trips that I'd planned,

346
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:25,779
whether it was LA or San Francisco or Vegas, Tokyo.

347
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:28,241
And I had a lot of people reply.

348
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,378
And so yeah, I was able to learn from these people

349
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:34,380
because they'd been in situations

350
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,123
where they were already used to posing

351
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,164
and I never had to worry about that.

352
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,748
I could see how makeup artists worked.

353
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:43,314
I could see how they held themselves for different shoots.

354
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,814
all whilst knowing that I'd never really done that.

355
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:49,637
These are actually, I never shot pictures of people at all

356
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:54,741
before, maybe my nephew at his birthday.

357
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,822
But suddenly I just had this confidence

358
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:59,745
and I accepted the nervousness of like, you know what,

359
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:00,866
I have nothing to lose,

360
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,307
so I would just reach out to different people.

361
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:04,833
On the bottom right, you see my message.

362
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,834
I go like, love your work.

363
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,616
If you're ever in Montreal, let me know.

364
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,376
Here's my link.

365
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,837
Nothing more than that.

366
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:12,179
Put it out there, and I think it was that mentality

367
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,320
of like, you know, today, tomorrow.

368
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,382
Nothing in my life's really gonna change,

369
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,224
so I might as well take that step,

370
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:18,785
almost like tennis, and just serve it.

371
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,328
And so what was cool is I got to meet these people,

372
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,570
and they were really inspiring to me

373
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,812
because these are people that all actually

374
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:28,453
had some kind of link to video games.

375
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,524
This is a DJ called Danger.

376
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:33,146
He's actually inspired by one of the things,

377
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,687
the Black Mage in Final Fantasy.

378
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:36,508
So he has a mask.

379
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:36,828
French DJ.

380
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,871
And he actually did the soundtrack for Fury,

381
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,512
which is a little indie game.

382
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:42,212
Great.

383
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:45,835
The other thing is he's a graphic designer,

384
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:47,756
so he designs all of his stage graphics.

385
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:49,618
He designs his logo, all his branding,

386
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:50,819
handles it all himself.

387
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,140
So I was like meeting these people,

388
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,281
although I had this camera,

389
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:56,022
it became this kind of device or way

390
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,363
that I was able to just meet people

391
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:58,384
and hear about their stories.

392
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:04,494
At some point, one of the biggest J-pop bands reached out.

393
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:07,735
I noticed they followed me, so then I just sent a message.

394
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:09,656
And at some point they were like,

395
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:12,017
hey, you're in LA, why don't we, you take my picture?

396
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:12,978
I was like, cool.

397
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:15,819
And this is actually the first shot of people I ever did.

398
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:19,260
And it's, there's nothing special, but it's, I don't know.

399
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,801
It was that idea that I randomly was in Japan,

400
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:25,082
like in LA, sorry, and people I'd never met

401
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:25,823
had to take this picture.

402
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:30,696
Another person I ended up reaching out to was Ryuhei Kitamura,

403
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:31,816
and I knew his work from film.

404
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:36,420
He made the movie Versus, Midnight Meat Train, things like that,

405
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,242
one of the first Japanese films I'd ever seen.

406
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:42,605
What I didn't know is he actually directed all the cut scenes in Metal Gear Solid.

407
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:46,388
So from there, I had this skill, I realized I got to know him,

408
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,050
and he mentored me, I think he just kind of helped me out a lot.

409
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,514
And it was actually because of him I got to take pictures of someone else that I'll show later.

410
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:58,090
There's also a Shima Shirai, she was a climber.

411
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,411
And so I think it's more a point of get is like the fact

412
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,252
that I'm here, I'm at my phone, and I was like,

413
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:07,192
there must be some opportunities that I can seek and hunt

414
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,633
down just so I can learn more and learn faster,

415
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,414
learn efficiently.

416
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,714
On the right is actually Jessica Vann, who's an actress.

417
00:17:15,714 --> 00:17:18,495
She was actually Hannah in Battlefield 4.

418
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,656
So it was a surreal thing of like, you know,

419
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,036
I'm making all this stuff that I care about.

420
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,197
I'm channeling video games and whatnot.

421
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,712
and meeting people along the way.

422
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,513
At some point, I get the comic artists of,

423
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,554
it's like Spider-Gwen,

424
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:34,636
and you can see the similarities anyway.

425
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,177
But at some point, I knew I was in LA,

426
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:38,238
so I reached out to one of the biggest

427
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,380
Spider-Gwen cosplayers,

428
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,520
and it happened to be Hendo,

429
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,681
who has a huge following online.

430
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,122
She actually used to work at Square Enix, I think.

431
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:48,637
And so when I was meeting these people, I had this kind of these anxieties,

432
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:51,739
because I get really anxious when I meet somebody

433
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,760
and I didn't know what I would be able to talk about,

434
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,521
how I'd be able to direct them,

435
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:59,324
how I'd be able to meet the shot that I had in my head

436
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,605
and finding locations, being prepared for it.

437
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:02,026
Two more points.

438
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:08,615
Yeah, so as I continue,

439
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:10,497
just taking pictures of different people,

440
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,078
it was something that,

441
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:14,899
basically I picked up photography, plateaued,

442
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:16,901
then I was like, I need to learn something more,

443
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:18,642
I started to learn the technical side,

444
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:21,023
start to learn about lighting, consistency and whatnot.

445
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,425
And it was this that kind of led me to

446
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,907
a fashion shoot randomly.

447
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:31,250
And so I was in Japan at the time,

448
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,031
just on vacation actually,

449
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:34,132
and I was directing five models.

450
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,875
in the middle of Tokyo and I had seven days to turn it around.

451
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,200
So as someone who kind of works in AAA,

452
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,163
I used to do indie stuff in the past,

453
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,565
but I wasn't used to that quick turnaround.

454
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,530
So it was entirely out of my comfort zone.

455
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,993
Each model was from a different place.

456
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:51,989
yeah, I had like a brief and had to match it.

457
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:55,331
And it was a weird thing as a game artist because

458
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,953
I spend so much time just, you know, at my computer or whatnot.

459
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,795
I actually don't go outside that much.

460
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:04,178
And so this was helping me to kind of just get out there,

461
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,258
put my stuff out there.

462
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:09,541
And it was a weird thing actually seeing my stuff physically,

463
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,542
which sounds kind of weird to some people.

464
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:11,903
Whoops.

465
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:14,124
So yeah.

466
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,884
I guess the craziest thing was like Nigo who's,

467
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:21,008
he works for Uniqlo and did Bape and stuff like that.

468
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:24,452
So when I think about, you know,

469
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:26,594
I was trying to build this talk and originally they said,

470
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,677
why don't you do a talk about your journey in photography?

471
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:31,439
I was actually trying to think of the stuff

472
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,000
that has really honestly helped me in my journey

473
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,803
and to try and get to where I wanted to go.

474
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,545
So the points that I made were,

475
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:38,906
first one, like learn something new.

476
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:39,386
I think.

477
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:43,667
one of the most important things is to keep learning different skills that can help

478
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:50,209
impact the stuff that you do so that you can grow as an artist. Number two, put yourself out there.

479
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:55,610
I think as artists we think about the things that we're scared of. We're scared of if people won't

480
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,971
like stuff, if they won't look at it, if you're honestly just wasting your time, if you won't make

481
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:06,173
money, all of this stuff. I learned to just forget about all of that, put myself out there in a way

482
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:09,653
that I was comfortable with, which actually meant not actually speaking to people.

483
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:11,935
just reaching out.

484
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,417
And I knew that the last point is,

485
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,379
the only way to progress was to actually

486
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,421
be around people who were doing that stuff well.

487
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:21,604
So I have like one last example.

488
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,304
This to me was like a surreal moment

489
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:27,950
because at this point I'd been putting my stuff out there

490
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,652
and suddenly I lift up my viewfinder

491
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,153
and it's Hideo Kojima on the other side

492
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:32,914
and I was just like.

493
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,376
mentally I was like shaking my cameras and stuff,

494
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:37,877
because I was just like,

495
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:39,338
I'm not going to get a good shot of this.

496
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,579
Like, it's just not going to happen.

497
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,160
But then I realized that everything, you know,

498
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,422
I'd practiced enough and I was comfortable enough

499
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:48,603
with the camera, any anxieties I had,

500
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:51,564
it basically took like 2000 pictures of just like,

501
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:52,505
I better get something good.

502
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:54,786
And I knew I wanted to shoot.

503
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,467
So the panic was like lesser than what I thought it was.

504
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:00,328
And at some point I'm stood in front of him,

505
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:01,309
it's just him and his office,

506
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,669
and I'm just like, I have no idea what I'm doing.

507
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:04,890
Like my background is mostly aesthetic pictures,

508
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,271
and I was just like snapping away.

509
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,572
So after a few days of like hanging out,

510
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,253
I was hanging out and I was like,

511
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,014
I need to show him something

512
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:15,654
because I don't want to make him wait too long

513
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:16,915
because I don't know.

514
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:18,675
And I, you can tell actually the anxiety

515
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,016
because I sent a picture of my,

516
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,537
from my phone instead of the high res picture.

517
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,438
Because I was like, I'd rather he doesn't see

518
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,938
what the colors look like and all of this stuff.

519
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:29,258
I sent him a DM on Twitter and I sent it to Hideo Kojima.

520
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:33,141
So it was like sneak peek and he's like master of the sneak peeks and stuff.

521
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:36,183
So I was like, this is probably the most stupid thing I've ever done.

522
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:38,644
And to make it worse, I see the little blue tick and I'm like,

523
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:39,685
he's like left me on red.

524
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:41,346
And it's it only been like six minutes,

525
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:44,828
but it was like the most stressful six minutes of my life.

526
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,869
And it was funny because as an art director, you know,

527
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,831
being working like five years, nothing.

528
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,253
You're always going to feel these anxieties.

529
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,998
And at some point, they feel less worse

530
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:57,359
once you kind of get out of your comfort zone.

531
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,260
And he sent me the little thumbs up emoji.

532
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,840
And I was like, phew.

533
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,281
Because I was like, he's not gonna reply.

534
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:04,981
He's not gonna happen.

535
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:07,022
Probably just gonna, probably forgot I even existed.

536
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:09,342
And what was funny is like, you know,

537
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:11,383
I was inspired by the stuff growing up.

538
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:13,684
I'm sure a lot of us played Metal Gear Solid.

539
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:15,284
Some of us might know Snatcher.

540
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:15,904
It's a Cyberpunk game.

541
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,825
I think it was the first game he ever worked on.

542
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,915
And this was the image.

543
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:25,778
And I took a bunch of other images.

544
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:29,400
And so yeah, the point I was making is just,

545
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,141
it's a weird one where I learned a skill,

546
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,623
but I was able to lean on the stuff

547
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:37,605
that I was comfortable with,

548
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,627
whilst also just being completely out of my element.

549
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:41,088
And I have one video,

550
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:44,230
which I felt summarized my feeling.

551
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,271
It's not gonna play the audio.

552
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:45,771
Great.

553
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:52,689
into the water than you feel you're capable of being in.

554
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,890
Go a little bit out of your depth.

555
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,571
And when you don't feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom,

556
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:01,171
you're just about in the right place to do something exciting.

557
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,392
So a cough, yeah, because basically, like,

558
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:04,953
if you feel safe in the area you're working in,

559
00:23:04,953 --> 00:23:06,973
you need to go a little bit out of your comfort zone,

560
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,814
a little bit out of your depth,

561
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:12,615
because that's where you're going to make the most interesting stuff.

562
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:17,850
So sometimes as artists we need to go out of our comfort zone,

563
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,712
pick up a new skill, try a different style,

564
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:24,295
do a lot of work to kind of slowly chip away at that,

565
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:26,456
go on a stage, speak at GDC,

566
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:28,398
things that help us move forward

567
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:31,940
either a day, a month, a year,

568
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,862
but ultimately things that pushes out our comfort zone.

569
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:35,022
That's all.

570
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:35,623
Thank you.

571
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:48,803
I don't know how I'm doing for time.

572
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,765
I can take questions.

573
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:52,625
Five minutes.

574
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,626
Feel free to go up to the mic.

575
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:57,347
Tell me where you're from, what you do.

576
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,490
Hi there.

577
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,691
My name is Brantley McCord.

578
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:05,514
I'm an instructor over in Indiana at Purdue University

579
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:07,576
co-instructing while I'm a grad student.

580
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:11,519
And so where we're at, we mostly try to develop tech

581
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,882
artists, and we're kind of in an awkward position because

582
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:16,783
we're mainly an engineering school.

583
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:20,686
So not the best artists, but also not the best programmers

584
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:22,187
yet, and we're working on that.

585
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:26,250
But a lot of my students seem to have a reluctance to make

586
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,252
a portfolio because they feel like they need to get their

587
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:28,572
foot in the door.

588
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:31,174
good enough for the portfolio to show it first.

589
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:33,815
Do you think that holds them back

590
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:35,416
or do you think there is a threshold

591
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,378
that they should get their artwork to first

592
00:24:37,378 --> 00:24:39,539
before they start showing it?

593
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,400
So that's a good question.

594
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
I guess the question is like,

595
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,181
yeah, what point do you feel comfortable

596
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,662
with your portfolio enough to share it

597
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:47,744
and maybe the process it took to make it?

598
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:49,665
For me, I think it was after university

599
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:53,168
and again after I realized I wanted to move up.

600
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:55,569
I dedicated a lot of my time to working on my portfolio

601
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,350
and I think

602
00:24:57,007 --> 00:25:03,070
When you're starting out, one of the most important things is being able to realise what the quality bar is.

603
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,413
Me personally, I would go on LinkedIn, I would find all of the artists that were in the area I wanted to work in,

604
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:10,053
and I would actually just reach out to them.

605
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:15,116
And I would say, hey, my name's Liam, I'm just starting out, would I be able to ask you some questions?

606
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:17,617
And I'd just leave it. I always end with a question in email, I'll keep it brief.

607
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,578
They would reply and they'd give me all of this feedback.

608
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:22,965
So I think the most important thing is really knowing

609
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:25,806
where your work is in relation to where it needs to be

610
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,747
so that you can really clearly identify

611
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:28,767
the parts that you need to grow.

612
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,068
That's what helped me personally.

613
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:30,408
Thank you so much.

614
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:30,568
Thank you.

615
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:31,788
Good for time.

616
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:32,408
Okay, thank you so much.

617
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:33,449
I think there's a room after, but cheers, appreciate it.
