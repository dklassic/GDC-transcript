1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,330
Okay, I think I'm gonna get started soon.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,961
Hello everyone, I'm Steve Lee.

3
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:15,722
This talk is called An Approach to Holistic Level Design.

4
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,764
Before I get started, I'd like to remind everyone to turn off

5
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,066
your phones and make sure you fill in your review forms

6
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:22,706
after the talk.

7
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:26,328
Especially if you've stayed in from the last talk, I think

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:33,471
you need to leave the room and make sure you get scanned so

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,412
that you can receive the notification

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,473
to review the talk.

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:39,708
Finally, if we're looking fairly forward,

12
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:42,031
in general it's cool if you can sit closer to the middle,

13
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,553
so it's easier for people to sit down

14
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,975
if they enter during the talk.

15
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:50,082
And also, yeah, there's no filming allowed

16
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:51,804
after like the first five minutes of the talk,

17
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:52,405
I've been told.

18
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,327
Okay.

19
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,960
So a little bit about me.

20
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:58,742
I've been a level designer in the industry

21
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:02,066
for about 10 years now, shipping these four games.

22
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:05,449
The first one in the list is an open world

23
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:06,430
action driving game.

24
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:08,973
But since then I've kind of deliberately made moves

25
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:12,377
towards first person games and games

26
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,259
with an increasingly kind of holistic approach

27
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,621
to level design in terms of how I see it.

28
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:19,263
that satisfy a particular set of values.

29
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:22,906
Particularly the last two, Bioshock,

30
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,707
and especially Dishonored 2,

31
00:01:25,207 --> 00:01:26,608
which are games that belong to this genre

32
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,010
known as immersive sims, which I'll touch on a lot.

33
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,492
I'll kind of discuss a lot of ideas

34
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,713
kind of connected to that genre.

35
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,414
So one thing to bear in mind is that while I hope the ideas I talk about in this

36
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,878
presentation are kind of relevant to many kinds of games,

37
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:46,422
I should say that these three games are three of my favorites of all time and

38
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:46,842
they kind of,

39
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:50,146
you know, this talk is very much informed by their sensibilities.

40
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:54,714
OK, so what do I mean by a holistic level design?

41
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:59,436
The dictionary says, it will talk about how holistic

42
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:02,497
thinking is generally about seeing everything, every part

43
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:05,359
of a design in terms of how it affects the whole and how the

44
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,399
whole can be much greater than the sum of its parts.

45
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,941
My favorite summary of this idea is a quote from this

46
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,042
great book called 101 Things I Learned at Architecture

47
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:14,262
School.

48
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,508
which isn't a level design book,

49
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,850
but I recommend it to all level designers.

50
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,393
It's got a lot of stuff that has very strong parallels

51
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,095
to the creative process and that kind of thing.

52
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:26,918
The quote is about the nature of beauty,

53
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,199
and it goes like this.

54
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,422
Beauty is due more to the harmonious relationships

55
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:32,924
among the elements of a composition

56
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:34,565
than to the elements themselves.

57
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:36,667
And needless to say,

58
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:38,489
I think this is often very true of level design.

59
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,862
So speaking of the elements of the composition,

60
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,945
these are the 3 elements I'm going to talk about in games,

61
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:47,846
which are, well, referred to,

62
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,949
which are presentation, gameplay, and story.

63
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,492
If you just kind of categorize all the different parts of games

64
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:55,592
into these 3 main pillars.

65
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,255
And note here that by presentation,

66
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:01,657
I generally mean all the kind of audio visual output of the game,

67
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,379
and so like graphics and sound,

68
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,520
and everything the player sees,

69
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,282
but also like text and stuff like that,

70
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,483
and I'll get into why later.

71
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:15,208
Now these big 3 elements are all very important in their own right, all deserving of talks

72
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:19,851
dedicated to each of them, but this talk is specifically about how everything works together.

73
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:24,093
So I'm going to focus on topics that emerge from the relationships between these things

74
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:25,734
instead of the things themselves.

75
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:31,338
So to explain what I mean by this, between these pillars of gameplay and presentation,

76
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:34,940
I'm going to talk about these concepts of affordances and intentionality.

77
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:42,025
Between the way we present things in story emerges this idea we refer to as world building.

78
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:52,908
And finally, between gameplay and story emerges this idea of interactive narrative and all that kind of thing.

79
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:55,089
So this is a talk to kind of highlight and summarize these things

80
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,770
and give a few tips on what we can do to apply them in our level design.

81
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,531
So first up, affordances and intentionality.

82
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:07,326
2 concepts which emerged from this relationship between gameplay and the way we present things.

83
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:11,450
I'm going to talk about affordances first and then use that to lead into the concept

84
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,373
of intentionality because they're very strongly connected.

85
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:20,700
So affordances is this term that is generally considered to come from the world of industrial

86
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,080
design.

87
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,185
A great book to read about this is this one, The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman.

88
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,038
And the classic example of affordances in action

89
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:31,279
is the design of door handles.

90
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,300
So if you look at this photo, you can see two doors.

91
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,441
And the one on the left should be pushed.

92
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:37,522
The one on the right should be pulled.

93
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:41,644
And the problem here is that the handles for both of these doors

94
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:42,284
look the same.

95
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:44,885
And also, they both look like they should be pulled.

96
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:48,067
So you can imagine how people will approach the door

97
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,908
on the left and intuitively pull it instead of pushing it

98
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,369
and look like a bit of a fool.

99
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,536
So here we can say that the affordances of these door handles on the left are very poorly designed because they're misleading.

100
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:10,132
By contrast, here are some much better door handles where the push panel on the left clearly affords being pushed in a way that kind of contrasts with the one that should be pulled.

101
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:14,267
And indeed, in this case, the affordances

102
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:16,448
are so clear and strong that you could remove the text

103
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:20,011
from these door handles and use them in any country,

104
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:22,092
and people would just intuitively use them correctly.

105
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,074
And that's the kind of goal of affordances,

106
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:27,396
is that it's about communicating

107
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:29,118
how things work intuitively.

108
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:31,900
We can talk about this as form-conveying function

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,521
to use kind of industrial design lingo.

110
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,245
And designing a font as well is a crucial part

111
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:39,088
of designing anything that is used by people.

112
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,913
And of course, this includes games and level design.

113
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,259
So what kind of a fonts are we talking about

114
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,120
when it comes to level design?

115
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:50,145
This is a screenshot from an early mission in Dishonored 2,

116
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:54,247
Edge of the World. Not my mission, I'll talk about mine later.

117
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:58,350
In a fully realized, immersive 3D game like Dishonored,

118
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,691
the most obvious affordances in first-person level design,

119
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:04,913
in particular, are visual, and they're conveyed through things

120
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,914
like layouts and lighting and all this kind of stuff,

121
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,116
all relative to the player's view as they move through the environment.

122
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:13,689
So, you know, some of the main affordances we're talking about

123
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,772
are like the presentation of the player's navigation options

124
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:18,874
in relation to their goals and the obstacles.

125
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,358
And, you know, we design layouts partly to present options

126
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,900
to the player about where they can go and what they can do.

127
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:26,682
And in the case of Dishonored,

128
00:06:27,143 --> 00:06:28,884
we deliberately add a lot of verticality

129
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,887
to allow the players to reach higher viewpoints,

130
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:35,451
which, you know, afford a much better view of the situation.

131
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,721
And finally within the layer we have like you know a bunch of

132
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:43,182
specific interactive objects that we had and that afford

133
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:44,762
particular gameplay opportunities.

134
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:48,124
And this can be both was that the play could pick up and throw

135
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:52,265
to distract gots on those that we and could sneak a place and

136
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,626
peek through the key holes and that kind of thing to spy on

137
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,007
people and in this screenshot we have a street speaker that's

138
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,989
hanging above the streets and that the play can shoot down to

139
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,989
distract. Gots and that kind of thing.

140
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,895
We also employ this rule that every wall of lights,

141
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:09,055
which is the obstacle in the far end of the screenshot,

142
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:14,316
every wall of light is connected by a cable to its power source,

143
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:18,797
and so it affords following that cable and using a panel,

144
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:22,638
reaching the power panel to disable the wall of light.

145
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,858
And I mentioned that every wall of light follows the rule

146
00:07:26,878 --> 00:07:29,319
because it's important that these kind of low-level

147
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:32,320
gameplay affordances like this are all consistent.

148
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:36,408
For example, it's important that we're very clear about

149
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:37,950
all kind of low-level interactions,

150
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,891
like whether a door is interactive or not,

151
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,834
or whether this glass can be broken or not,

152
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:43,434
and that kind of thing.

153
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:48,146
And this screenshot here above is about how at Arkane,

154
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:50,086
it's forbidden to use the same meshes

155
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,548
for a non-interactive door as an interactive one.

156
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,149
Because we really want to make it clear

157
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:58,050
so that players don't just kind of only find out

158
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,031
that it's a non-interactive one when they've walked up to it

159
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,452
and when they're trying to use it.

160
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:05,233
So we tried to establish a very clear visual language,

161
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:08,434
like non-interactive doors being physically blocked by things

162
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:11,916
that are always used in this world, in this district.

163
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:15,797
And you know, and on a high level, the fiction of the world,

164
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:19,218
like Dunwall and Karnica,

165
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,218
there's a reason why there's always kind of disease

166
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,759
and stuff like that, because it justifies buildings

167
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,239
being abandoned and closed down

168
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,340
and kind of justifies these level design requirements

169
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
that we can't have every door be interactive, right.

170
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,501
So yeah, we try to establish a clear visual language

171
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,722
and then stick to it so players can learn consistently

172
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:40,783
about how things work and then act with that information.

173
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:45,865
And as well as those kind of low level of funds this there are lots of kind of

174
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,146
broader high level ones to consider to such as

175
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:53,027
community communicates the play how broad the possibility space and how much

176
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:53,847
agency they have.

177
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:56,967
You know this is no there's no use in kind of

178
00:08:57,368 --> 00:09:00,228
designing a big complex level full of different stuff

179
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:04,049
if players don't realize that it's not a number there while the play.

180
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:08,190
So this is a screenshot of the dust district which is my mission into some

181
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,290
of 2.

182
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,141
And I worked on this with level architect Christophe Lefort.

183
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,603
We knew that the mission kind of fundamentally

184
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,345
revolved around two factions and a choice

185
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:19,526
about helping one over the other.

186
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,808
So one of the first things we talked about

187
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,809
was reflecting this in the layout at a high level

188
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,011
and presenting the two factions at a very clear junction.

189
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,662
And hopefully this kind of not only makes it very clear

190
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,022
that there's a big choice to make

191
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:34,003
and that it's a fundamental part of this mission,

192
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,844
but also we hope that it allows the players

193
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:39,145
to look at the layout from this perspective

194
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,186
and kind of visualize and intuitively understand

195
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:44,746
how different this mission can be based on their choice.

196
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:50,653
Another heavy lift when it came to high level of finances and

197
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:53,274
exposing the size of the possibility space and that kind of thing

198
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:57,295
I was the briefing with Megan the start of the mission and the task of

199
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,215
dates that come afterwards.

200
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:02,657
At the end of the day the Dust District is quite a busy mission with a lot of

201
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:03,817
stuff in it that we

202
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:06,858
could potentially talk to the player about and let them understand.

203
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,600
But in the end we were very deliberate about

204
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,461
which information we convey to the player and which stuff we kind of hint at in a vague way

205
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,922
and which information we just don't give the player at all.

206
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:21,854
So in one category, there's the crucial stuff about the mission that the player needs to know.

207
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:25,620
Like, there's two factions, this is the choice you can make,

208
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:30,347
and we want to be explicit about the fact that it will change the future of Karnica

209
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:32,350
and change the endings and that kind of thing.

210
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:37,876
And kind of the second category is stuff that we talk about in vague terms and hint at,

211
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:42,739
kind of, you know, such as the fact that you can find a solution to the Jindosh Lok,

212
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,861
which is the thing you need to open to progress to the next mission.

213
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:50,004
You can find a solution without helping the factions, in fact, if you find out how.

214
00:10:50,264 --> 00:10:52,305
And we just tell the player that that solution exists,

215
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,646
but we don't tell them where it is or even what it is.

216
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,728
And we leave that to players who want to explore.

217
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:00,102
And finally, we have a bunch of stuff about the mission

218
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:02,603
which we deliberately don't talk to players about at all.

219
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,524
You know, things like the fact that you can find

220
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:09,425
Corvo's old home in this mission, and things like that.

221
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,246
But also, there's this huge thing,

222
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:15,527
which is that you can skip the entire mission

223
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,247
by solving the Jindosh lock on your own.

224
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:21,367
And it was important to us that we didn't tell the player about this at all.

225
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:25,410
We actually kind of iterated on the dialogue in the briefing

226
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,832
and, you know, kind of tuned the text and the task updates

227
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:32,694
to make it, well, sorry, the information for the objectives and stuff.

228
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,157
We deliberately tried to hype it up as something that is really,

229
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:39,098
like, nobody's done it, like, nobody in Kanaka has ever solved this puzzle

230
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,240
to kind of, you know, make it seem like this big thing

231
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,743
that is like this impossible obstacle, you know.

232
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:51,537
But then at the same time, we positioned it near the start of the mission so players would

233
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,518
find it on their own and discover it on their own.

234
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:59,540
So it was important to us that we just didn't talk to the player about this at all and let

235
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
them discover it on their own.

236
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,201
So if you're making non-linear levels, it's really worth thinking about how and how much

237
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:09,343
you choose to be explicit about the size and the content of the level's possibility space.

238
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:12,100
We want players to understand the situations they're in,

239
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,021
but without giving so much away that we spoil surprises.

240
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,881
And we don't want to spoil the genuine experience

241
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,802
of exploration and discovery.

242
00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:22,843
Unfortunately, we've dishonored by making levels

243
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,963
that are very non-linear and very dense.

244
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,204
We're in a cool position where we can promise a lot to the player

245
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,145
by being explicit about the mission,

246
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:31,925
but then hopefully deliver even more

247
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,646
to kind of surpass people's expectations

248
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:35,487
that we've established.

249
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:46,930
One final thing I wanted to talk about in relation to affordances is this kind of running joke or recurring idea that players don't look up in level design.

250
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,531
And the thing is that while players...

251
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:54,557
looking up has become kind of slightly trickiest since the big

252
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,459
kind of make mainstream make it me to us consoles and controllers

253
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,382
and you know we kind of know that this isn't true in the case of certain games

254
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:05,144
for example in dishonored you know plays the couple the time because they're in a

255
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,045
stealth situation

256
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,828
and the very mobile and we teach players that being in high ground is very safe

257
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:12,549
and it's very useful for like

258
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,813
surveying this the situation and second of example players look up in Titanfall

259
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:19,514
especially multiplayer

260
00:13:20,192 --> 00:13:22,835
because they're always looking for opportunities to run on walls,

261
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,618
they're getting sniped at from rooftops,

262
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:27,581
and of course there are like 50-foot robots blowing things up.

263
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,483
So you're going to look up all the time in that game.

264
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,276
And kind of on a more moment to moment basis,

265
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:34,938
you know, players look up when they go up a staircase.

266
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,659
They look up if they're in a small room,

267
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,180
but there are cables hanging from the ceiling.

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,582
A pipe above the player gushing water onto the floor

269
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,342
would make them look up.

270
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:45,664
Maybe if they were in a dark room

271
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,405
and the only light source is above them,

272
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:50,526
they would naturally look up at the light source.

273
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,668
So the lesson here is that when players aren't looking up,

274
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:55,789
The problem isn't like players,

275
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:58,269
the players or the human nature or anything like that.

276
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,730
It's actually like affordances that have kind of emerged

277
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,870
without us knowing perhaps.

278
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,611
You know, and if the players aren't looking up,

279
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:08,051
it's either like maybe we can redesign

280
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:10,972
the way we present the situation they're in

281
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,192
to kind of teach them to look up.

282
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:15,273
Or perhaps we're fighting kind of higher level affordances

283
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,353
where the game, maybe the rest of the game

284
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:18,854
has taught them that this isn't a game

285
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:19,654
where you need to look up.

286
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,594
And people are kind of like just running

287
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,155
with that higher level affordance

288
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:23,895
from the rest of the game.

289
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,940
And so the reason I talk about phone says is because of how

290
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,702
they relate to the subject of the talk with topic which is

291
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,144
player intentionality

292
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:38,568
and because the phone says a crucial to facilitate this idea of

293
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,609
play intentionality.

294
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,032
It's a quick set.

295
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:47,357
This idea of intentionality in games seems to have been coined around 1997, I

296
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:49,619
think, partly by Doug Church who did a talk.

297
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:52,699
and an essay on gamma sutra called

298
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,099
Formal Abstract Design Tools,

299
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,700
which you can still read online,

300
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,581
and a book by Janet Murray called

301
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:58,861
Hamlet on the Holodeck,

302
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,002
which kind of explored this in terms of narrative,

303
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:02,062
an interactive narrative.

304
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,165
So, there's lots of fancier definitions

305
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:09,686
that you can Google of this,

306
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:12,707
but my version is that acting of intentionality

307
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,107
is making conscious choices

308
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:16,708
with specific goals and expectations in mind.

309
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:19,717
And this might sound like super basic,

310
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,199
like something we can take for granted

311
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,860
that players are just naturally doing all the time

312
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,481
when you play a game,

313
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:25,762
but it's often kind of not the case

314
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:30,206
and often because of kind of maybe slightly wonky choices

315
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:31,447
in the level design and that kind of thing.

316
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,390
So here's some examples of weak intentionality

317
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,452
that we've kind of probably all experienced at some point.

318
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:40,255
You know, being lost and trying to find something to do

319
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:43,137
or trying to figure out what's going on is, of course,

320
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,279
not really acting with a strong sense of intentionality,

321
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,720
just kind of wandering around aimlessly.

322
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:51,307
And kind of a mod doing something without knowing why you're doing it,

323
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:54,593
but only because either the game's UI has told you to do it

324
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,117
or because it seems like the only thing you can do

325
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,822
or because you think it's what the designer wants you to do.

326
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:03,579
or you know that that thing where you find a lever in a game and you pull the

327
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,420
lever because it's a lever in a video game and you're always supposed to pull

328
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,240
leaves in video games.

329
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,001
That's not acting with intentionality, that's kind of lame, right.

330
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:14,502
And finally like twitch reacting to sudden surprises is not really

331
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:18,623
you know if a monster jumps out at you from behind a door you've just opened

332
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:22,164
it's more of an instinctive response and not an intentional kind of

333
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,625
you know choice, you know.

334
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:26,285
So that doesn't really count as

335
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:28,226
intentionality as far as we're concerned.

336
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,676
And the thing is that enabling player intentionality

337
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:35,080
is at the heart of all immersive sim gameplay,

338
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,045
and the way that systems and level design is approached.

339
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,891
To us, this is the whole point of presenting these gameplay

340
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,093
challenges and stuff to the player.

341
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:51,009
So this is why in Dishonored, all of the gameplay mechanics

342
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,491
and abilities revolving around this idea of giving the player

343
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:57,614
unique and combinable powers, like blinking and bend time

344
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:59,695
and all this stuff, that encourages players

345
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,457
to come up with their own ways of solving problems

346
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:04,499
and overcoming obstacles.

347
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,401
Going back to the screenshot of the Edge of the World mission

348
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:06,861
in Dishonored 2.

349
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:11,090
All of these affordances that we were talking about are trying to present the player

350
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,857
information about their situation so that they can

351
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:18,664
understand their options in relation to their goals and formulate a plan

352
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,327
and then act with intentionality.

353
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:24,027
This concept of intentionality is so important at Arkane

354
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:24,987
that as a level designer,

355
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,590
if you suggest a gameplay challenge or an optional puzzle

356
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,251
that seems like it's kind of lacking intentionality

357
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:34,133
at any point of the way, the idea will just be rejected.

358
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,335
Like it's just bad level design as far as we're concerned.

359
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:40,477
And wherever possible, we probably slip up sometimes,

360
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,899
but wherever possible, we always want the player

361
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,560
to be acting with intentionality by default.

362
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,372
So to break the concept down a little,

363
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:51,194
these are the four things that I think players need in order

364
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:52,275
to act with intentionality.

365
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,137
First of all is choice, the presentation of a choice.

366
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,761
Second is motivation, having goals in mind.

367
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,203
The third one is information that they

368
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,805
garner from clear and consistent affordances.

369
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:07,408
And finally, you need time to process that information.

370
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:08,829
You can't pressure the player too much

371
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,232
in order to distract them from the information

372
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:12,913
that they need to have.

373
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,215
And with those in mind, here are some ways

374
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,117
of facilitating intentionality.

375
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:21,259
First of all, it's the clear and consistent advances

376
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:21,939
that I've talked about.

377
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,763
Second of all, it really helps if you present the player

378
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,664
with higher level and longer term goals,

379
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:31,226
instead of kind of drip feeding them lower level tasks,

380
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:33,347
like look over here, and walk in that room,

381
00:18:33,387 --> 00:18:34,148
and press this button.

382
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,790
It's way cooler to just give them

383
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,772
a higher level objective, which they

384
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:40,973
can find their own solution to.

385
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:44,364
And of course this is how Dishonored always works.

386
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:45,726
The textbook Dishonored mission is,

387
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,247
you're at this part of the map

388
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,729
and somewhere on the other side of the map

389
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,571
is some bad guy you've got to kill

390
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:52,373
and it's up to you how you do it.

391
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,075
And it's up to you to explore

392
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:55,916
and find your own journey towards that goal.

393
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:02,060
Finally, there's this idea of player-driven pacing and player-initiated action.

394
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:04,202
It's generally...

395
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:06,725
Again, it relates to the idea that players need time

396
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:10,229
to take in the information and formulate a plan.

397
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,494
It's just way cooler if you can find ways of giving the player space

398
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:16,416
to act intentionally.

399
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,609
And with this in mind we can consider a kind of a 4 step

400
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,090
cycle of a kind of a game play cycle.

401
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,311
I'm not sure who originally came up with this to be honest,

402
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:29,212
it's been mentioned in other talks at GDC

403
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:32,453
like by Clint Hawking, Nels Anderson, Forrest Darling

404
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:33,253
have all talked about this.

405
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:38,554
But yeah, it can be useful to consider this loop as something

406
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,615
that the player continuously goes through as they play.

407
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:43,456
So if we start at the top with observing,

408
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:45,496
the player is taking in information

409
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:46,296
about their situation.

410
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:49,084
And then they use that information and combine it

411
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,665
with their goals and their motivations to form a plan.

412
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:53,966
Then they execute the plan.

413
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:57,028
And then perhaps there's a fourth step

414
00:19:57,068 --> 00:20:00,269
where they react, perhaps instinctively,

415
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:04,071
to maybe the plan not going to as they thought it would,

416
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:08,733
or reacting to some emergent situations that arise from it.

417
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:11,174
And then they go back to observing, of course.

418
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:12,394
And there's just this constant cycle

419
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:14,815
of taking in information, formulating plans,

420
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:16,536
and acting with those plans in mind.

421
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:20,818
And of course, stealth gameplay is particularly good

422
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:21,878
at emphasizing this loop.

423
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,261
It's built into stealth games that the player starts

424
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:28,463
in a hidden state, where they then have time

425
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,225
to think and explore and analyze the situation,

426
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:34,087
and then formulate an intention before they reveal themselves.

427
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,448
And they have to start thinking in a more dynamic way.

428
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,765
And as I said before, in Dishonored,

429
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:42,967
we use a combination of player mobility and verticality

430
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,869
in our layouts to empower the player to reach safer,

431
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,310
higher places that give them more time

432
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,611
and a better perspective for their observation and planning

433
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:50,991
phases.

434
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,973
But a crucial point here is that you don't need to be making

435
00:20:54,993 --> 00:20:58,095
a stealth game to kind of facilitate intentionality.

436
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:02,477
This is a screenshot of Doom 2 on the left, which I love

437
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:05,399
dearly, and Doom 3, which I was a little bit less keen on.

438
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,259
And

439
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:10,019
Dooms 3, the thing was partly because of its move

440
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,020
towards a scary horror game kind of vibe.

441
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,042
It had a lot of monsters kind of popping out of nowhere

442
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,344
and trying to eat your face and that kind of thing.

443
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,746
And often it would like teleport monsters behind you

444
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:22,567
after like doing something arbitrary,

445
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,948
like picking up some ammo or pulling a lever

446
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:25,609
or something like that.

447
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:27,970
And this kind of works for the horror vibe

448
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,291
that it was going for.

449
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:31,972
But the kind of flip side to this

450
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,994
is that this reliance on frequent surprises.

451
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,742
where the player has no way of knowing what's going on

452
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:38,223
until it's in their face,

453
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:41,086
it has a side effect of killing a lot of the player's ability

454
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,267
to act with intentionality.

455
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:45,790
And it's kind of reduced to very short-term twitchy responses

456
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,492
to things that they didn't expect.

457
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:51,504
Now, Doom 2 generally had some of these surprises too.

458
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,705
Sometimes you would open a door and a pinkie's in your face,

459
00:21:53,865 --> 00:21:54,445
and that kind of thing.

460
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:57,806
But as well, it also offered way more situations

461
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:00,967
where the player was in a much bigger area

462
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:03,547
where they had time to consider the situation

463
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:05,608
and always choose which weapon they wanted to use

464
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:07,108
against these set of monsters I've seen.

465
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,254
And also in the screenshot on the left, which is from a classic level called Barrels of Fun,

466
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:17,120
it would even use setups where enemies were facing away from the player.

467
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,527
So it was almost like they managed to find ways to almost implement a kind of stealth-like approach to the game,

468
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:26,992
where you can see the situation before anyone even knows you're there.

469
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,061
A final point about intentionality is that it affects

470
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,583
how players perceive linearity in level design.

471
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:37,665
Generally, I would say if linearity feels bad,

472
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:40,287
part of the reason at least is often

473
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,988
because the intentionality is kind of lacking or a little weak.

474
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:46,431
I mentioned earlier that Half-Life 2

475
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,692
is one of my favorite games of all time.

476
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,614
One of the things that people often praise it for

477
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:53,756
is this idea that it does a really good job

478
00:22:53,776 --> 00:22:55,657
of feeling a lot less linear than it really is.

479
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,704
And I think there's a lot of reasons for this, you know,

480
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,025
an engaging story with well-written characters

481
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:01,846
helps a lot.

482
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,867
But yeah, like I say, intentionality I think explains

483
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:05,727
some of this as well.

484
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:08,748
The thing is here is that Valve have play-tested

485
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:11,469
their levels so much and iterated on their affordances

486
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,211
so much that in general, they've managed to align

487
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,232
what the player wants to do with the thing

488
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,052
that they have to do.

489
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,633
And so even though the game is linear,

490
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,054
it rarely feels like you're doing things

491
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,335
without knowing why, or just because the game told you to.

492
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:29,634
On a similar note, Portal is even more linear than Half-Life 2.

493
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:33,415
And yet, generally speaking, very few people complained about it being linear.

494
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:37,157
It's because even though there's usually only one solution to progress,

495
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:41,098
being a puzzle game and all, the player is given the time and the freedom

496
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,040
and just the right information to constantly experiment with the Portal gun

497
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,101
with intentionality in order to solve that solution.

498
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,709
One way of looking at it, it might sound kind of goofy,

499
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:57,572
but I was thinking about how the more linear your game is,

500
00:23:57,632 --> 00:24:01,015
the more you can kind of say that your job as a level designer

501
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:04,598
kind of has parallels with what the guys do in Inception,

502
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,640
in the sense that you're trying to present,

503
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,923
kind of design and present situations in such a way

504
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,044
that players will naturally learn and want to do the thing

505
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:12,945
that you want them to do,

506
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,567
but they will feel that it was their idea all along.

507
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,150
And if you get this right, generally speaking,

508
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,711
linearity stops being a problem.

509
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,271
But if you get it wrong, you know, the players kind of jolted out of the experience,

510
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:28,236
they're kind of conscious of the artificiality of the experience and they'll reject it.

511
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:31,499
You know, they won't be as engaged as a result.

512
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,361
So the overall point here is that, you know,

513
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,403
whether your game is linear or non-linear,

514
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:41,407
intentionality is pretty crucial and fundamental to the gameplay experience.

515
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,952
I have a little note to myself about taking a sip of water here,

516
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:47,653
so that's what I'll do.

517
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,638
Okay, so number two of the three big topics,

518
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:58,119
which emerges from this relationship between the way we present things and the

519
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:58,479
story,

520
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,260
is this idea of world building.

521
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,620
I mentioned

522
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,201
earlier on games like Half-Life and Bioshock and Dishonored, you know,

523
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,921
these are all games that are praised for this very rich,

524
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:12,322
vivid sense of place and world building.

525
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:16,323
And to be honest, a lot of this is kind of art direction stuff and high-level

526
00:25:16,363 --> 00:25:17,663
story stuff, which

527
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,204
especially if you're in a big company you won't really have a hand in.

528
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,727
you know, playing with yourself.

529
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:25,329
But I think there's still a lot you can contribute

530
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,752
on a lower level in order to kind of add

531
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:28,492
to the world building.

532
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,235
So with this in mind, I'm gonna present

533
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,217
these kind of three little goals for world building,

534
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:35,559
which is to create a world that feels unique,

535
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,361
cohesive, and meaningful.

536
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:41,184
And with those tips, sorry, with those goals in mind,

537
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:41,885
are a few tips.

538
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:46,333
So number one is that I suggest that world building

539
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:47,614
must always be specific.

540
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:51,517
I mean this both in terms of like being detailed

541
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:53,638
in the kind of ideas you're presenting

542
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,881
and not just being vague ideas of like it's the future

543
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,862
and there's war and corporations.

544
00:25:58,982 --> 00:26:00,203
Like if that's all you present,

545
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:01,904
then you might be establishing a genre,

546
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:03,545
but you're not really building a specific world.

547
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,511
And the other thing is that, yeah, like I said,

548
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,152
the idea must be the more specific to your world

549
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,794
that this idea is, like this particular game's world

550
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:14,896
and not like all sci-fi games or all noir games or whatever,

551
00:26:15,496 --> 00:26:17,537
you know, the more you're building a particular thing

552
00:26:17,557 --> 00:26:19,358
because, you know, people can only judge your world

553
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:21,159
based on the things that are unique about it.

554
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,760
Those are the things that will stand out the most.

555
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,522
And, you know, one thing is here,

556
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:28,443
it doesn't necessarily mean that everything

557
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,604
has to be completely original.

558
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:32,964
Harvey Smith, our creative director on Dishonored 2,

559
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:35,965
he talked a lot about, in interviews and stuff,

560
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:39,726
about, well, he used Kieran Jindosh as an example

561
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,726
of how he's kind of quite a well-used archetype

562
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,767
in this kind of game. He's kind of a crazy,

563
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:46,227
evil, genius scientist guy.

564
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,228
But by layering details and specificity

565
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:50,308
on top of this archetype,

566
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,429
he turns the character from someone

567
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:55,489
who could feel like a bit of a cliche

568
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:57,830
into someone who feels unique enough

569
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,990
to contribute to this world and the world-building.

570
00:27:01,031 --> 00:27:04,693
So to run through those examples, our crazy evil scientist guy

571
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:09,755
happens to look like this weird love child of Nikola Tesla and Prince.

572
00:27:09,815 --> 00:27:12,897
He builds robots and gives them his own voice, which is a bit weird.

573
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:16,819
And when he's tasked with securing an important building,

574
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,820
he does it with this super obscure puzzle, the Jindosh Lock,

575
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,762
as a way of reveling in his own intellect.

576
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,884
And finally, he lost his finger and thumb in an industrial accident,

577
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:29,325
and he has this bionic thumb that he can smoke like a pipe.

578
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:33,015
And these details might seem kind of trivial on their own,

579
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:37,300
but altogether they add enough specificity to the character

580
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,523
to make him stop feeling like just kind of a trope

581
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:43,126
or whatever and becomes unique enough

582
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:44,728
to contribute to the world building.

583
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:49,979
With that kind of stuff in mind, I tried to populate the Dust District, which is my mission,

584
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,485
with scenes that help build the world and tell stories that feel specific to the Dishonored

585
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:59,889
Universe and also to this particular district, which has its own unique story.

586
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:07,097
So just to run through them quickly, on the left is a scene about the inside the Black

587
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:08,138
Market, which is kind of a...

588
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,982
you know, video game shop where you can go in and talk to someone and spend your money

589
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,082
on nice items and things.

590
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:19,384
But I didn't want it to just be a pure gameplay thing, so I added this scene where howlers,

591
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,365
who are like the crime mafia-like style faction.

592
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,047
they're harassing the shopkeeper for protection money,

593
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,008
and supposedly claiming that they're protecting them

594
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:31,569
from the overseers, who wouldn't agree with the fact

595
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,069
that they're selling magical stuff,

596
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,130
like bone charms and stuff in their shop.

597
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,951
The scene in the middle is this scene

598
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:40,812
where overseers are executing civilians

599
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,433
for breaking their religious principles

600
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:45,853
and doing things that are considered impure and forbidden,

601
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:46,894
again, which is this kind of,

602
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,415
an idea that is quite specific to their ideology,

603
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:51,375
and is kind of fleshing out them as a faction.

604
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:53,995
And on the right, there's a scene where,

605
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,815
inside the Overseer Outpost,

606
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,636
where an Overseer is mercy killing a friend,

607
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:00,277
another Overseer, after he was mortally wounded

608
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:01,357
in a fight with Howlers.

609
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:03,758
And through the way it's done,

610
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:05,199
and the way they talk about it,

611
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,780
I hope that it reflects a special kind of discipline

612
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,141
and conviction that characterizes

613
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,221
the way the Overseers think.

614
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:15,023
And so all of these scenes are supposed to kind of

615
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:17,304
convey information that is specific to these factions

616
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,584
in this district and this game.

617
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:24,448
So yeah, in general world building should be as specific as we can make it.

618
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:28,110
The point number 2 is that we should always be world building.

619
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,371
Try not to see it as something where

620
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:31,171
you kind of

621
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:35,273
off the critical path you have a small little room with some world building

622
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:38,254
stuff and then you go back to the gameplay where you're shooting monsters.

623
00:29:38,414 --> 00:29:38,774
If you can

624
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:41,015
try and approach every idea in your level.

625
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:44,158
as an opportunity to build the world.

626
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:46,861
Every NPC you place or you can talk to,

627
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:49,303
every objective or side quest,

628
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:53,127
every kind of piece of loot that you place in a meaningful position

629
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:56,370
can develop the world in some way.

630
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,092
So try and look at all of these things as opportunities.

631
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:02,055
I've got a couple of small examples of this.

632
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,529
in the in the district this this building on the right on the right one

633
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:07,929
in the red.

634
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:12,531
I wish this is just like a facade like an empty building with no interior they

635
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,231
couldn't go into

636
00:30:14,091 --> 00:30:17,672
and and at some point I I realize that it would be really useful to open

637
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,553
up the building so you can go in and you know so

638
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,674
to present the play with more navigation options on this area.

639
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:26,857
And we could have easily made this just like another generic

640
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,098
abandoned apartment.

641
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,540
But instead, through the way we did the set dressing

642
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,241
and appropriate placement of loot,

643
00:30:33,902 --> 00:30:35,643
and by adding a note for the player to read,

644
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:38,685
we tried to tell a story about someone who used to live here,

645
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:40,406
but got kicked out by the overseers

646
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:42,327
when they were moving into the territory

647
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:44,829
and invading on the area.

648
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:46,870
So it's just a small example of how

649
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,332
something that could have been just this generic empty room,

650
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:51,113
we used even that to tell a story.

651
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:55,459
And similarly with a room inside the overseer outpost,

652
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:58,380
you know, I knew that from a gameplay

653
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,520
and exploration point of view,

654
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,061
I wanted a room with juicy loot to pick up.

655
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,741
And again, we tried to find a way that is specific

656
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,922
to kind of not only justify it in the world,

657
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:08,662
but to build the world of it.

658
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:11,323
So we made it into a room where the overseers

659
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:13,063
are confiscating things that kind of break

660
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,104
their religious principles,

661
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:17,185
and so we chose to add like bone charms

662
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:19,545
and stuff like that in there to support this idea.

663
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:24,788
And the third point is about world building,

664
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:26,669
particularly in this kind of game, maybe,

665
00:31:27,209 --> 00:31:28,310
maybe not for all kinds of games,

666
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,032
but it's good if your world building

667
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:33,334
says things about the people in the world.

668
00:31:33,914 --> 00:31:35,416
World building is a form of storytelling,

669
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,177
and stories are always about people.

670
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:39,819
In film, there's a great example of this

671
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,122
in Children of Men, which I really recommend

672
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,102
if you haven't seen it,

673
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:46,985
in which the world building is always about people,

674
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:48,626
and what would become of us in a world

675
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,467
where hope is kind of fading away.

676
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:56,952
In practically every shot of this movie, the background and the mise-en-scene and all that stuff is speaking to us about

677
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:59,653
how this loss of hope would change our society.

678
00:32:00,174 --> 00:32:04,497
You know, it would change the role of police, people's political values,

679
00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:08,860
like attitudes to immigrants and that kind of thing, and even our attitudes to suicide in this case.

680
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,862
In games, the classic example is Bioshock,

681
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,563
where every part of its world is trying to tell

682
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:19,865
and support this idea of how a society might crumble

683
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:22,466
if people were relentlessly pursuing progress

684
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,667
in this Randian objectivist kind of way.

685
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:28,729
One little thing I really like in the game Metro 2033,

686
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:32,891
which is this kind of post-apocalyptic game,

687
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:36,553
is this decision to show a child playing with a toy car

688
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:39,734
inside the player's hub area with an adult watching over him.

689
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:45,394
It feels quite memorable and appropriate and meaningful in the context of this particular game

690
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:50,418
because it symbolizes how people in this world aren't just killing the monsters because monsters are bad,

691
00:32:50,698 --> 00:32:54,721
but they're trying to save the future and build a future for their children.

692
00:32:55,462 --> 00:32:57,964
And it supports the game's kind of recurring ideas and themes.

693
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,445
that are reflected throughout the game and in its branching endings and stuff

694
00:33:01,985 --> 00:33:04,046
about how survival in this world is about

695
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:06,947
more than just like fighting and defeating enemies, but it's

696
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:08,628
also about holding on to like

697
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:12,029
our wisdom and compassion and empathy during kind of dark times.

698
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:17,071
So it's a simple idea, but it resonates with the particular themes of this

699
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:18,111
particular game and world.

700
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,173
And for me, in the case of Dishonored, in my head it's...

701
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:27,395
The world is generally about power relationships and corruption.

702
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:31,137
And this idea that everyone, depending on their place in society,

703
00:33:31,197 --> 00:33:34,939
is either screwing somebody else over or being screwed over by somebody else.

704
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,562
And of course, it's the lower-class citizens who get screwed the most.

705
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:40,963
So, for example, in the Dust District,

706
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:46,026
which is kind of like this lower-class area near a mining district,

707
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:51,842
We added this kind of wooden, weird wooden kind of raised street structure

708
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:56,848
that people have built in response to the dust storms and environmental problems

709
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:57,909
that have been caused by the Duke.

710
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,274
And so they've kind of been figuratively pushed underground

711
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,456
by the problems caused by the people in power.

712
00:34:04,157 --> 00:34:06,618
But also, they're kind of trapped, literally,

713
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:08,739
in the middle of this ideological fight

714
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:09,659
between the two factions.

715
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,860
And this street is placed in the middle of the map

716
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,141
in between those two HQs.

717
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:15,141
And so it's supposed to be something that,

718
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:17,162
you know, more than just looking cool,

719
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:20,123
it's meant to be a symbol of, you know,

720
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:22,624
something that is unique to the story of this district

721
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,785
and its people, and support the broader themes

722
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,806
and the tone of the Dishonored universe in general.

723
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,487
This idea that people are being victims

724
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,568
of the people above them, essentially.

725
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,650
So yeah, to summarize, three points.

726
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,311
Point number one was world building must be specific.

727
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:42,232
Point number two was always be world building

728
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:44,113
and don't just see it as a kind of extra thing.

729
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,974
And point number three was the importance

730
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,894
of saying things about people in your world

731
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:51,415
or relating to human ideas in general.

732
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:56,918
And the third part is, how am I doing with time?

733
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:57,398
Oh, not so bad.

734
00:34:58,178 --> 00:34:59,999
But the third part is interactive narrative,

735
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,980
this idea that emerges from the relationship between.

736
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:07,724
into interactivity and story.

737
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:12,086
So one little disclaimer here is that this is a huge topic

738
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:14,066
that I should not be trying to tackle in 15 minutes,

739
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:18,608
but I'm gonna try and hone in on one or two particular ways

740
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,948
of approaching this topic that kind of resonate

741
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,249
with me personally and that I kind of think are a big deal.

742
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:29,764
I realized that everything, or most of the stuff I wanted to say related to this idea

743
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:31,206
of show and tell.

744
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:38,533
And specifically the fact that in the context of interactive narrative in particular, I

745
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:43,798
don't think this is a really good phrase for us to use as a guiding principle, and I think

746
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:44,679
we should be careful about it.

747
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,041
It's useful for a lot of aspects of level design,

748
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:49,182
like the world building stuff,

749
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:51,643
in the sense that it encourages people to think

750
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,065
about communicating stuff visually

751
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,146
and in the world in front of the player, which is cool.

752
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,787
And not just using cut scenes

753
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,909
and big blocks of text and stuff like that.

754
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,610
But my argument would be that specifically

755
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,372
in terms of like interactive narrative,

756
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:10,074
only showing and telling things is just not the full thing.

757
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:11,195
We need to do more than that.

758
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,031
And the reason why this phrase is kind of problematic

759
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,851
is because we've lifted it from passive mediums

760
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,772
like films and novels,

761
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:22,993
and which don't need to worry about interactivity at all.

762
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:25,753
So with that said, I think we can get somewhere

763
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,353
that's more useful to us if we look at

764
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,534
what this phrase means to those mediums

765
00:36:29,914 --> 00:36:31,454
rather than focusing on the phrase itself.

766
00:36:33,095 --> 00:36:34,895
So to explain what I mean by this,

767
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:38,736
in film, show, don't tell is generally about this idea

768
00:36:38,756 --> 00:36:41,436
of telling the story using the unique strength of the medium.

769
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:44,896
which in the case of film is moving pictures and editing between them

770
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:48,320
in a way that creates drama and evokes ideas.

771
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:52,003
In literature, by contrast,

772
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:56,688
Show, Don't Tell is about the idea of writing in a way that evokes ideas and drama

773
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,291
in the reader's mind and imagination.

774
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,632
So instead of simply telling the reader things like,

775
00:37:04,153 --> 00:37:05,914
John was very sad when he said goodbye,

776
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:09,357
or old abandoned playground had a really creepy atmosphere,

777
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:11,820
we need to write in a way that evokes these ideas

778
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,002
instead of just throws them in the reader's face.

779
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:19,647
So if we take those two key parts of those kind of ideas,

780
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:21,889
we have using the unique strength of the medium

781
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,972
and evoking drama and ideas in the audience's mind.

782
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:28,699
And personally, I think pretty much every game that is kind of

783
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,500
interesting from an interactive narrative point of view

784
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,741
does at least one of these things well.

785
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,462
Some games kind of naturally lean towards one or the other,

786
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:39,883
but yeah, it does one of them, I find.

787
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:44,925
And so first of all, a couple of, a few examples of using the unique strength of the medium.

788
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:48,586
To me, like, the idea of...

789
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:52,854
Well, of course, in interactive media,

790
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:55,176
interactivity is the unique strength of the medium.

791
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:58,780
And combining interactivity with narrative

792
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,163
naturally leads us towards this idea of empowering the player

793
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:04,866
to act with what I'll call narrative intentionality.

794
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:07,588
I talked about intentionality earlier,

795
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:11,232
but mostly in terms of gameplay and gameplay goals.

796
00:38:11,876 --> 00:38:14,297
But here we're talking about the idea of giving the player

797
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,339
the information and the time and the opportunity

798
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,701
to make intentional choices, but with narrative goals in mind

799
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,701
and not just gameplay ones.

800
00:38:22,522 --> 00:38:24,724
I also mentioned how Dishonored and Immersive Sims revolve

801
00:38:24,744 --> 00:38:25,644
around intentionality.

802
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:28,606
And this kind of goes for narrative intentionality, too.

803
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:31,731
And this is on its case, especially like I'm so

804
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:36,615
and it's on his case narrative intentionality is kind of go

805
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:40,759
into the game the systems level in the sense that every NPC

806
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:43,341
in the game can be you know you can even sneak around them

807
00:38:43,441 --> 00:38:44,983
or you can deal with them on leafly

808
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:47,265
or you can know them horribly of course

809
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,728
and we tell the players that this will change the story

810
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,449
in the world and certain scenes in the game

811
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:54,191
and the endings and the kind of thing.

812
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,585
And so what this does is it transforms

813
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,085
like a simple, what would be a simple gameplay choice

814
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:00,786
into an opportunity to act

815
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:02,986
and express narrative intentionality

816
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:04,887
every time you encounter an NPC.

817
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:07,668
That's the kind of thing we're into.

818
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:10,368
Going back to the Dust District,

819
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:11,809
one of the main things that appealed to me

820
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:12,969
about this particular mission

821
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,370
when I was kind of given the mission to work on

822
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,330
is that its premise revolves around this idea

823
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,971
of choosing a faction and making a choice

824
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,211
that will affect the endings of the game.

825
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:26,135
So the mission, the unique thing about the mission

826
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,076
is this act of narrative intentionality

827
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,038
kind of built into the whole premise of the mission.

828
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,880
And with that kind of thing in mind,

829
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,101
I mentioned in the world building section,

830
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:37,583
these three scenes that I tried to develop

831
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:38,544
the world with in some way.

832
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:41,286
But another kind of aspect of it is that

833
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,188
I deliberately designed them to kind of encourage

834
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,590
the player to act with narrative intentionality.

835
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:50,812
So two things about these scenes is that first of all,

836
00:39:50,832 --> 00:39:52,052
they're not just scenes that you watch.

837
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,853
I'm not just showing and telling a story here.

838
00:39:55,413 --> 00:39:57,534
These scenes are deliberately designed to be interrupted

839
00:39:57,574 --> 00:39:58,655
and interacted with,

840
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:01,596
and they all have extra lines and scripting and stuff

841
00:40:02,036 --> 00:40:05,637
beyond the main scene in order to react to certain choices

842
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:06,398
that the player can make.

843
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:09,499
And secondly, these scenes are there

844
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,479
to present interesting dramatic situations

845
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,520
which invite the player to interact

846
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,781
with narrative goals and values in mind

847
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,061
and not just gameplay ones.

848
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:19,606
you know, as far as I'm concerned,

849
00:40:19,666 --> 00:40:22,468
whenever I can make a player make gameplay choices

850
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:23,369
that they're moving through a level

851
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,851
with narrative goals in mind and not gameplay ones,

852
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,213
it's kind of more interesting and, you know,

853
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:29,795
cooler and more immersive and that kind of thing.

854
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,777
And so, you know, any opportunity I can do,

855
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:35,180
take to do that, I kind of try and take it.

856
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,516
So that was about using the unique strength of the medium,

857
00:40:39,556 --> 00:40:43,478
which is agency and how that leads to narrative intentionality.

858
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:47,159
If we take a look at the literature's take on this phrase,

859
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,521
we have this idea of evoking drama and ideas in the audience's mind.

860
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:52,202
And...

861
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:56,103
Yeah, I've got an example of this.

862
00:40:56,143 --> 00:40:57,164
I've got three examples of this.

863
00:40:57,284 --> 00:41:00,525
The first one is a kind of low-level, in-the-moment kind of thing.

864
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:02,486
It's a bit of a pet peeve of mine.

865
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:02,926
When...

866
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:09,154
like basically when something very dramatic and perilous is happening to

867
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:13,696
the player character, but in the game it's presented as a cut scene, so

868
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:17,677
control is taken away from the player just before it happens and so

869
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:20,777
while the character is thinking, oh my god, I'm in peril, the player is thinking,

870
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:24,198
oh, it's a cut scene, I can relax, I don't have to do anything and it's the

871
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:27,699
complete opposite of what the character is supposed to be thinking. So it's just

872
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:30,440
like, you know, I'm a big bit sensitive to this, it always drives me mad.

873
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:35,207
By contrast, this scene from Uncharted 2,

874
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,388
where you're navigating this collapsing building

875
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,589
when the helicopter's blowing it up,

876
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,612
is kind of a crazy, extreme, expensive example.

877
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:43,112
It's amazing.

878
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:46,775
But the cool thing here is that Nathan Drake

879
00:41:46,835 --> 00:41:48,136
is kind of cropping his pants and thinking,

880
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:49,136
oh my God, what am I going to do?

881
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:52,379
And the player is hopefully figuratively cropping their pants

882
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:54,060
and thinking, oh my God, what am I going to do?

883
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,182
And so they've perfectly spent a lot of money and time

884
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:00,104
to align the player's thoughts with the character's thoughts

885
00:42:00,164 --> 00:42:01,665
in this dramatic situation.

886
00:42:02,965 --> 00:42:04,787
You know, it reminds me of this phrase by,

887
00:42:05,207 --> 00:42:08,189
quote from Frank Capra, who's like a filmmaker from the 30s,

888
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:11,691
I think, who talked about how he made mistakes in drama.

889
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:14,053
I thought drama was when actors cried,

890
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:15,934
but drama is when the audience cries.

891
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:20,077
And of course, we can take that idea and apply it to games,

892
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,498
because we want the player's experience

893
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:23,599
to be these dramatic highs and lows,

894
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,881
and not just something they see on the screen.

895
00:42:28,162 --> 00:42:30,904
And my second example of evoking ideas is this

896
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:33,667
classic pick up the can scene from Half-Life 2.

897
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:37,350
For anyone who hasn't played it, well, first of all,

898
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,312
shame on you, you should really play Half-Life 2.

899
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:39,912
It's really good.

900
00:42:40,613 --> 00:42:43,415
But secondly, it's basically a tutorial for the player

901
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,397
for picking up and interacting with physics objects.

902
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,519
But what's cool is that the level designer

903
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:51,562
used it as an opportunity to allow players

904
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,364
to act with a narrative intentionality.

905
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:59,151
you know between the when you pick up the can the game tells you that you can

906
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:02,298
even put it in the in the trash can I can throw it at the combine guys head.

907
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:07,455
And this choice between obeying and rebelling is a narrative thing

908
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:11,979
that the player is going to consider when they go through this tutorial.

909
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,762
But an extra cool thing about this is that these two particular choices,

910
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:18,204
this idea of obeying and rebelling,

911
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:24,169
basically sum up the human condition of people in the world of City 17.

912
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,371
Every citizen here is struggling with this choice

913
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:29,854
of whether or not they should obey and conform or resist and rebel.

914
00:43:30,901 --> 00:43:33,383
And so by being oppressed by the Combine directly

915
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:35,584
and making this choice yourselves,

916
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:37,446
the player relates to their plight, essentially,

917
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:38,827
and relates to them as people.

918
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,609
And so when you come up to this scene later in the game,

919
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:43,190
you don't just shoot the baddies

920
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,511
because they're baddies in a video game,

921
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,473
but you naturally side with the civilians

922
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:47,353
because you relate to them,

923
00:43:47,934 --> 00:43:49,415
and you're naturally opposed to the Combine

924
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,477
based on a personal, interactive experience that came before.

925
00:43:53,713 --> 00:43:57,334
So even though Half-Life 2's story and gameplay is pretty linear and stuff,

926
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:02,735
to me it still qualifies as solid, immersive, interactive storytelling

927
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:05,495
because it's very smart about emotionally involving the player

928
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,055
in the ideas and themes of the story.

929
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:09,976
My final example is,

930
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:13,197
it might be a surprise to immersive sim people

931
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,637
because generally immersive sim people aren't so keen on this game,

932
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:19,498
but I think this particular scene is amazing.

933
00:44:20,698 --> 00:44:21,898
So near the start of the game,

934
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:26,577
It's establishing you as the main character, this father,

935
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:29,859
in a game about losing your child and desperately wanting to save them,

936
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:30,880
and doing anything to save them.

937
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,723
And you're out in the garden, play-fighting in this very melodramatic,

938
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:36,683
Star Wars kind of way,

939
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:42,186
and as with a lot of Heavy Rain, it's a sequence of quick-time events,

940
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:45,448
where you have a prompt to press the button on screen,

941
00:44:46,334 --> 00:44:50,964
And based on whether or not you succeed or fail at this,

942
00:44:51,626 --> 00:44:53,490
the game shows you a different animation, essentially.

943
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:56,055
Now, the interesting thing here is that.

944
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:59,148
if we follow our kind of gamer instincts

945
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,028
to just try and win the sequence,

946
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,670
we end up being a super douchey dad in the process.

947
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,951
And this scene, like I've watched a lot of play-throughs

948
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:08,091
of this on YouTube and stuff,

949
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:10,412
and it's really good at making players realize this

950
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:13,373
as they play and change the way they play

951
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:15,634
based on this kind of narrative desire

952
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:17,335
to play the role of a good dad.

953
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:24,497
And so it's cool because it's like, you know, the subject of this scene is quite grand in the sense that it's,

954
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:29,238
you know, it kind of reflects the fundamental nature of becoming a parent in the sense that

955
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:33,620
when you have a kid, you know, it's like, it changes your life in a way that means that

956
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,961
succeeding in your own kind of selfish terms is no longer the priority.

957
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:40,042
And that's what this whole scene is about, it conveys interactively.

958
00:45:41,628 --> 00:45:43,830
So yeah, it's a great example of how we can take even

959
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,292
something that seems kind of basic and binary

960
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:49,895
and typically trivial as pressing a button in time,

961
00:45:50,555 --> 00:45:52,316
but use it to kind of interactively evoke

962
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:54,618
some fairly big ideas about the story

963
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,199
and about life in general even.

964
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,681
And all of this is inside the player's mind

965
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:01,964
without explicitly telling them anything, which is awesome.

966
00:46:03,906 --> 00:46:07,408
So to summarize, yeah, these are my three points

967
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:08,789
about interactive narrative.

968
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:12,077
Number one was striving to do more than just show and tell

969
00:46:12,217 --> 00:46:12,937
wherever possible.

970
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,738
Number two was empowering the player

971
00:46:15,758 --> 00:46:17,259
to act with narrative intentionality.

972
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:20,100
And or, depending on your kind of game,

973
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,842
you can try and think of ways to evoke drama and story

974
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:27,283
and ideas in the player's mind and not just on screen.

975
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:31,425
And so we've got a couple of minutes.

976
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:32,485
So yeah, to wrap up.

977
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:37,353
As a closing thought, I thought about this particular section of a book called

978
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:40,955
Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud, which is a super smart book that I

979
00:46:40,995 --> 00:46:41,675
recommend to everyone.

980
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:46,998
It's kind of written to educate people and change people's perspective on

981
00:46:47,018 --> 00:46:50,720
comics, but I think it has the effect of doing this, changing the way we look at

982
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,701
pretty much every medium.

983
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:54,462
And I really recommend it to everyone if you like this kind of thing.

984
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:57,731
And don't worry about reading the text on the panels here,

985
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:01,013
but in this section of the book,

986
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:03,034
he talks about how comics used to,

987
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,497
and perhaps still do, suffer from people assuming

988
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:09,699
that because comics are a medium made of pictures and words,

989
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:12,521
that you can just take a great artist and a great writer

990
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:13,982
and kind of just throw them together

991
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,422
and you've got a great comic.

992
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:18,921
And of course, in reality, if you just put nice words on nice pictures,

993
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:22,543
you only end up with something that's pretty like a shallow form of a comic

994
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:25,644
that doesn't really utilize the true magic of the medium.

995
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,726
And the experience of reading a great comic

996
00:47:29,106 --> 00:47:31,508
doesn't just come from the combination of these two things,

997
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:35,950
but it's completely defined by this art form's particular set

998
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:38,031
of special relationships between words and pictures.

999
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:41,570
And of course, the whole point of this talk

1000
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,712
is to talk about how level design is kind of the same thing,

1001
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:45,033
or at least it's one way of looking at it.

1002
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:47,214
I think we've all played games before

1003
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:50,016
where these three elements, the gameplay and the story

1004
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,657
and the graphics and the world or whatever,

1005
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:53,899
they're all good individually,

1006
00:47:53,939 --> 00:47:55,600
but they don't seem to kind of gel so well.

1007
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,282
They're not really working together.

1008
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:02,525
And to me, when games and level design are at their peak,

1009
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:04,106
it's all about how these things work together.

1010
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:06,528
For those familiar with the genre

1011
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:08,549
known as the Massive Sims that I talked about.

1012
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:13,942
To me this approach and this set of ideas says a lot about,

1013
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:18,564
to me explains a lot about what the immersive part of immersive sim really means.

1014
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:25,106
To me these ideas aren't just extra nice little things to sprinkle on top of your gameplay and stuff

1015
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:27,227
to add flavor to the player experience.

1016
00:48:28,293 --> 00:48:30,554
I'd go as far as saying that these kind of games,

1017
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:33,096
with these kind of games and the kind of games

1018
00:48:33,116 --> 00:48:33,956
I'd like to see more of,

1019
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:36,037
these things are the player experience.

1020
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:37,538
You know, these three ideas

1021
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:39,960
are what the player is thinking about all the time.

1022
00:48:41,715 --> 00:48:46,341
You know, so I would argue that the individual pillars of gameplay and graphics and story and all this stuff,

1023
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:50,225
they're kind of just means to these ends, I would say.

1024
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:56,152
Now, to be honest, I'm not really sure that everybody will agree with that, but I would hope that,

1025
00:48:56,673 --> 00:49:01,318
you know, if I can encourage anyone to take this kind of perspective of level design, I think it would be a cool thing.

1026
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:03,959
And finally, on top of that, as level designers,

1027
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,360
when we work with other disciplines,

1028
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:07,122
you know, like artists and writers

1029
00:49:07,182 --> 00:49:08,624
and creative directors and stuff,

1030
00:49:09,224 --> 00:49:10,425
I think the more we can discuss

1031
00:49:10,465 --> 00:49:11,967
and establish these kinds of ideas

1032
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:14,249
as shared goals between departments,

1033
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,231
the better and more interesting

1034
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:17,572
and the cooler our games will be.

1035
00:49:19,114 --> 00:49:19,534
And that's it.

1036
00:49:20,015 --> 00:49:20,535
Thanks for listening.

1037
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:21,536
I hope it was interesting.
