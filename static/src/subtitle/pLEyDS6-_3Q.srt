1
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:04,804
Thanks for coming out.

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:11,009
There's happy hours I know and parties starting, so I appreciate you guys coming out for the

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,591
last session on Thursday.

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:14,117
I'm Drew Murray.

5
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:16,639
I'm the game director at Insomniac Games.

6
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,902
I recently shipped Sunset Overdrive.

7
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:22,264
Marcus Smith, who was supposed to be doing this with me,

8
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:24,686
he was the creative director, he bailed.

9
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,448
But that's my first pro tip for you,

10
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:29,030
is do a talk with someone else, have them bail,

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,811
and say you'll forgive them

12
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:31,853
if they do the entire PowerPoint presentation.

13
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:34,055
It makes presenting a lot easier.

14
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:36,537
So Marcus and I were about halfway through

15
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,018
the production of Resistance 3.

16
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,161
when Marcus, that's him,

17
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:42,726
he was the creative director on Resistance 3,

18
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:44,088
I was the lead designer.

19
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:47,214
We basically won the game design lottery.

20
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:52,070
Ted Price, Insomniac's CEO, came to us and said,

21
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,033
for our next game, we're going to do whatever you guys want.

22
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:59,478
If you guys want to do rabbits in space, we'll do rabbits in space.

23
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,860
That's the game design dream, right?

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,042
That's when you're starting school, or you get your first job.

25
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:06,224
People say, that's never, ever going to happen.

26
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:09,087
You're like, don't just give up the idea that that's ever going to happen.

27
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,588
If it's actually happening to us.

28
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:13,566
And we were as you would expect, we were ecstatic about this.

29
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:15,708
We didn't really have any constraints put on us.

30
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,571
The main one was that we couldn't do an open world game.

31
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:21,173
So we pitched and made Insomniac's first open world.

32
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:25,517
And we were really empowered to come up and create

33
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:26,537
with whatever we wanted to do.

34
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:28,339
And for the first couple months, it was awesome.

35
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:30,721
Marcus and I would get together, and we would brainstorm

36
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,662
like school kids.

37
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:35,605
Well, I like open world games, and centaurs, and Raymond

38
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,067
Pettibone, and La Tigra.

39
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,394
And he'd say, oh that's cool, I like pinball machines

40
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:42,919
and Tank Girl and Badminton and Sunset Walks

41
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,081
with my soulmate.

42
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,925
And we'd be like, awesome, let's make that.

43
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,628
And did I mention my fascination

44
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,972
with vintage Halloween masks and Jeff Koons?

45
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:53,911
And we carried gleefully on like that for a few months,

46
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,173
combined all these loves and interests

47
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:58,216
into this massive bloated PowerPoint

48
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:02,641
with no real connection or method to its madness,

49
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,563
and presented that to the owners of Insomniac Games.

50
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:07,988
And the best thing I can say about it is that they were more

51
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,870
dumbfounded, I think, than a gassed, and Ted didn't actually fire us.

52
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,373
They did have us, they gave us a few weeks and we came back with a little bit more semblance

53
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:18,793
of a game.

54
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:26,216
But today I'm going to talk about that process of how Marcus and I went from this sort of

55
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:30,939
mess of a PowerPoint presentation to what I think is a really fun game and a game that

56
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:31,679
I'm really proud of.

57
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:38,058
So the job of a director is, as you might guess, is to direct.

58
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,879
And to our mind, that encompasses three core aspects,

59
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,500
inspiration, communication, and conviction.

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,701
And these are what I'm going to be using to frame what I'm

61
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,962
talking about as I go through the tools that we used on

62
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:50,582
Sunset Overdrive.

63
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:54,125
Inspiration is something that's relevant to both you and the team.

64
00:02:54,125 --> 00:03:00,771
For you, you've got to be into this idea that you're going to spend the next three to four years of the cluster cuss that is game development.

65
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,173
And then the team obviously also has to be excited.

66
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:05,975
They're also there in that three to four year process.

67
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:15,744
But I think it's really helpful as well if you can give people something that they're able to still fit some of themselves in and be inspired and put a lot of themselves into.

68
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,985
If you're an introvert, and I am, communication is what it will seem like you do all day,

69
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,446
every day.

70
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,028
And it's the hardest part of the job.

71
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:29,371
There's the day-to-day of just making sure everyone is talking to each other and knows

72
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:29,912
what to do.

73
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:35,817
But the hard part was, as I said, taking this kind of crazy PowerPoint and a couple years

74
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:40,762
of Marcus's and my conversation and putting that into a cohesive package that in a few

75
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,004
minutes we could explain what we were trying to do to...

76
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:46,248
to the owners of the company, to the team,

77
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:49,072
and then ultimately when we were pitching it to publishers.

78
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:51,356
And the last is conviction.

79
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,681
You have to be the rock that really believes in the game.

80
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:56,363
You have to be championing the game.

81
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:02,772
Even if things aren't going well, and everybody knows it,

82
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:05,113
and you know it, and the game's awful, and it's broken,

83
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,694
and it's no fun, I think you still

84
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,455
have to be the person who believes in the process that's

85
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:11,856
like, yeah, we've done this before.

86
00:04:11,856 --> 00:04:13,977
It's always kind of shitty at some point.

87
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,978
And if we just keep walking through the swamp,

88
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,799
eventually we're going to hit dry land.

89
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,740
Because if you start feeling like, oh my god,

90
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,141
the process might not work, everyone picks up on it,

91
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,742
and everything starts to fall apart.

92
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,877
And so we can get to the substance of production.

93
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,179
I'm gonna give the most brief description

94
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,840
that I can of the first two years

95
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,822
that Marcus and I were talking about

96
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,383
and working on Sunset Overdrive

97
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:37,525
before we actually started making it.

98
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:41,587
And basically come down, came down to a lunch conversation that Marcus and I had.

99
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,688
If you could make any game, what would you want to make?

100
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:47,529
And we came up with this spin-off of I Am Legend,

101
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:50,330
the book more than the movie, but

102
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,130
we were interested in this idea of this mechanic of

103
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,292
the player being able to go out into a post-apocalyptic world that's

104
00:04:57,292 --> 00:05:00,073
relatively safe, that they could go out and explore

105
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,773
and scavenge and gather things and prepare, but then at night...

106
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:06,818
all the monsters would come out, they'd have to hunker down in their home and use all the supplies

107
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:12,385
that they had during the day and be under siege. And at first it was deadly serious, it was very

108
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:17,551
much the, we would have been going towards the like the insomniac version of day Z if we had

109
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,653
continued down that path.

110
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,402
Fortunately, someone sent around the Gorillaz video for On Melancholy Hill around that time

111
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:28,724
saying, man, it would be really cool to play a game that looks like this.

112
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,686
And the next time we got together, we were like, it would be really fun to make a game

113
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:34,666
that looks like this.

114
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,747
And I think that re-centered us in a very significant way.

115
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:40,849
Marcus and I and a lot of Insomniacs came to Insomniac because

116
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,933
We love the Spyro and Ratchet games, games that are a lot about fun and stylization and humor.

117
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:54,617
And this idea of shifting Sunset away from this dark, gray-toned zombie apocalypse is a very

118
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:58,299
colorful, fun-focused game that didn't take itself too seriously,

119
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:01,041
excited us a lot more and gave us a lot of freedom.

120
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:07,970
And that freedom led us up some, down some great roads and up some more difficult ones.

121
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,914
We really were inspired to start talking about all these things that we loved and found interesting.

122
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,538
We had some mechanical ideas for the game, but what was really exciting to us was to

123
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:21,221
be talking about a particular feeling or mood for the game.

124
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,904
And to that end, we weren't talking a lot about video games.

125
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:29,088
We were having conversations about the meanings of fashion and freedom and consumerism.

126
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,249
We were looking at art.

127
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,411
and talking about, like, the good and bad points

128
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,371
of different animes and British comedies,

129
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:39,273
and we were making mixed CDs with liner notes,

130
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,794
you know, telling each other why we thought that this song

131
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:44,775
embodied the spirit of Sunset Overdrive.

132
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:49,237
And it was really fun, and we were very, very slowly

133
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:52,538
honing in on what we wanted Sunset Overdrive to be.

134
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:55,499
And then once we had that rough concept,

135
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,840
we just needed to convince everyone else

136
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,300
that this was a good idea to make.

137
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,085
And unfortunately for us and anyone who had to sit through the early presentations,

138
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:09,690
we were not very good at distilling all those hours of conversations into soundbites.

139
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,714
And in fact, at the beginning, we didn't even try to distill them,

140
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:19,519
hence the bloated PowerPoint in which we dumped everything we liked in the lap of Insomniac's owners.

141
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:24,490
And the problem which we hadn't really considered but became the bane of our existence for the

142
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:31,039
next year or year and a half is that by changing to something kind of different, it went from

143
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,704
really easy, being really easy to describe the game, to really difficult.

144
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:38,066
When we were talking about making the I Am Legend,

145
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,448
Sunset Overdrive is really easy to be and say,

146
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,689
you know, it's kind of like The Walking Dead except at night

147
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,730
it'll be sort of like Dungeon Defenders or,

148
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,772
you know, it's going to look like Fallout or Resistance.

149
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:52,174
And people really like to default to A plus B statements.

150
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:54,935
They're easy to understand.

151
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:58,497
I think that most games and probably most creative projects

152
00:07:58,497 --> 00:07:59,338
are pitched that way.

153
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:00,358
You know, it's like The Matrix,

154
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:03,000
but The Matrix meets Fifty Shades of Grey.

155
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,780
Or more likely, it's going to have the sales of Call of Duty,

156
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,621
the subscription fees of World of Warcraft,

157
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,601
and the microtransactions of League of Legends.

158
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,121
It's going to be great.

159
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,202
And so what we tried to do was, we had all these things,

160
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,183
and so we tried to create an A plus B plus C plus D plus E statement

161
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,283
that would encompass the main point.

162
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,563
So, imagine the scavenging of Fallout

163
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,784
with the under siege feeling of Nazi zombies,

164
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:27,344
but starring the guerrillas in a hyperactive version

165
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:30,385
of an American city like Tekkonkinkreet was to Tokyo

166
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,845
with a humor of Repo Man.

167
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,027
And you can probably imagine that that didn't go over real well.

168
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:38,751
And I mean, I know the game and I look at that.

169
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,075
I'm not exactly sure what that would mean.

170
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,798
But we just continued forward with that.

171
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:48,100
And we kept trying to get more and more specific.

172
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,541
So we just kind of continued adding to the problem.

173
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,342
We added an F, and then a G, and then an H.

174
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:57,285
And then around the time we got to pre-production,

175
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,745
we had a team of around 20 to 22 people roll on.

176
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:03,268
They were still pretty confused by what

177
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:04,528
we were talking about doing.

178
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:08,650
And I think the team had trust in me and Marcus.

179
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,212
We'd been working with most of these people

180
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:11,892
for quite a while.

181
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:16,194
I think that they trusted our passion for the concept,

182
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:20,336
but I don't think there's a lot of faith in the concept itself at that time.

183
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:27,039
And Marcus and I, I mean, our job is describing the box in which everyone is supposed to be working.

184
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,500
And instead, we basically had this giant Katamari ball.

185
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,863
with all these disparate parts that were glommed on.

186
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,085
And we could talk about the specific parts.

187
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,046
We could say, well, that pink tree,

188
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,309
that represents this idea.

189
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,471
But it was really difficult to explain

190
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:42,393
how those things meshed together.

191
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,874
And so we started trying to come up

192
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,876
with some different strategies to get people

193
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,240
both on board with what we wanted to do

194
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,021
and also helping us figure out

195
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:52,983
what exactly it was we wanted to do.

196
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,155
So one of the first things we did was we started having movie nights.

197
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,017
Marcus and I are very similar people.

198
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:08,200
We're the exact same age.

199
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,642
We both grew up with dads who owned construction businesses

200
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,384
and spent our summers doing construction.

201
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:13,746
We both were punk rock kids.

202
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,267
We both went to art school.

203
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,771
And so whenever I say, yeah, do you remember that particular episode

204
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,653
from Facts of Life and remember how they did that?

205
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,334
He's like, yeah, I totally know what you're talking about.

206
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:26,279
But whenever we were working with our team,

207
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,821
a lot of different ages, a lot more diversity.

208
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:31,544
And so when we would say, make a reference to something like the Warriors,

209
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:33,226
the movie, the gang-sploitation movie,

210
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:36,370
a lot of them didn't have any idea of what we were talking about.

211
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:42,036
And so we started this idea of a movie night to try to create a shared vernacular.

212
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:47,019
And these were mostly based on creating a tone for sunset overdrive.

213
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,642
I think that movies and videos you can a lot of times even in just like a two or three

214
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:55,965
or five minute clip explain a tone to someone at most you're talking an hour and a half

215
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:56,546
or two hours.

216
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:59,348
It's a lot shorter than doing something like playing a game.

217
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:03,130
And one of the first ones we watched was The Warriors.

218
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,832
And we found that it really helped a lot.

219
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,613
In fact, it was kind of useless to have these

220
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:11,554
if we couldn't explain beforehand

221
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:14,416
this is the reason that we are watching this movie.

222
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,016
And so with The Warriors we said

223
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,097
we're going to have all these different survivor groups in the city.

224
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:25,142
We're going to watch this show and these gangs are like insanely wacky and really specialized

225
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,745
and they're very exaggerated, but they all take themselves very seriously.

226
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:33,808
They're silly, but they take themselves very seriously.

227
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:38,851
And so it was easy for us to say, that's the kind of feeling that we want for our survivor

228
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:42,253
groups and that clicked in, people got it, we got through the movie, it's like, okay,

229
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,535
that's what we needed to be focusing on.

230
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:51,097
Idiocracy was the same way, really good satire of pop culture and consumerism.

231
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:55,141
It helped sell, I think, a lot of the team on the idea of having humor in the game.

232
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,967
And then we watched other movies that didn't go over so well.

233
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:06,708
And I think part of that was, it was, I think certain movies it was hard for us to tease out.

234
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,969
Who's seen Turkey 182? Probably not a single person.

235
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:15,890
One person, alright. Turkey 182, it's about this guy who is fighting in this very outrageous public manner,

236
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,191
fighting against New York City Hall. It's kind of a slow burn of a movie.

237
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:25,641
Frankly, it's got kind of crappy production quality now that you go back and revisit it.

238
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:29,805
And I think that even though it's a little bit of something that we're trying to tease

239
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:36,011
out of there, frankly, most of the team was just laughing at the movie more than taking

240
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:36,812
it seriously.

241
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:41,837
And then my biggest personal disappointment was we watched a couple episodes of The Young

242
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:45,541
Ones, an old BBC comedy that they rebroadcast on MTV in the 80s.

243
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,502
It had very typically dry humor.

244
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:51,549
It had really outrageous physical comedy and violence.

245
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:55,315
Every week, segued into there would be a random rock band

246
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,198
playing in some random location like it might be.

247
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:01,812
a motorhead is playing in one of the characters' bedrooms, and there's no explanation for it.

248
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:06,876
It just happens, and it has like a through plotline, but it segues in and out of absurdity

249
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:12,620
and nonsense. And to us, this is great. This is what we want Sunset Overdrive to be.

250
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,664
But then we had the team watch it, and at the end of it, Lisa Brown, one of our designers,

251
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,685
raised her hand and she's like,

252
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:23,519
Why did you make us watch that?

253
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:43,301
yeah, this is it. We've got all this money and

254
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:46,707
Microsoft is going to publish a game that's like a version of the young ones

255
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:51,153
that people are just going to freak out and people are going to lose all

256
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:53,397
whatever faith they actually did have in us.

257
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:56,541
I mumbled something about humor and rapid pacing.

258
00:13:56,882 --> 00:14:01,166
and kind of left it at that because at the time I didn't feel confident enough to say that.

259
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:05,429
But it's an interesting counterpoint with Scott Pilgrim, which we watched a few weeks later.

260
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,552
And I think if you take the veneer away, they're very similar movies.

261
00:14:08,552 --> 00:14:12,876
They have a lot of absurdity, they're breaking the fourth wall, there's a lot of humor.

262
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:16,359
Music plays a big part in how, in the feel of the movie.

263
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,721
But a lot of it is just, it's just a lot more timely.

264
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:22,084
The stylization, the music, the humor, they feel more contemporary.

265
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:23,405
And I think for our team who was...

266
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:27,848
a lot of, you know, late 20s to mid 30s.

267
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:30,949
It just made a lot more sense than the young ones.

268
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,270
And people were like,

269
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,131
oh, yeah, we should totally make a game like Scott Pilgrim.

270
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:38,393
Thank God we're not making a game like that young ones show.

271
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:40,354
And so what we learned with the movie NICE

272
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,855
is really this idea of if we had a talking point

273
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:45,317
that we could tell people this is what you're looking at

274
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,619
and we could give them something that they could relate to,

275
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,420
they tended to go over really well and sell.

276
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,136
or help people grasp what we were doing with the tone really well.

277
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,051
So at the same time, we were trying to break the team

278
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:04,413
out of some of their preconceived notions

279
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:08,095
and normal way of thinking and designing games.

280
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:10,357
And so we started doing these song missions.

281
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:13,138
And I remembered this interview with Perry Farrell

282
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,319
when he was starting Jane's Addiction.

283
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,061
He talked about working with Dave Navarro a lot

284
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,123
and trying to sort of un-teach him how to play guitar

285
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,284
and keep his technical skills, obviously,

286
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:24,965
but putting him into a different headspace

287
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,726
of how rock and roll was supposed to sound.

288
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:29,507
And we want to do the same with our pre-production team.

289
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:32,448
So we started thinking of different exercises to do.

290
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:35,269
And one of the ones that we did was we started having these

291
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,829
song missions.

292
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,991
And every week, we would assign a song to every member

293
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,391
of the pre-production team.

294
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,792
And then a week later, we asked them to pitch a mission

295
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,413
based on either the lyrics of the song or how that

296
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:49,754
particular song made them feel.

297
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:52,835
And we did things like Tricky and LCD Sound System and Wu

298
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,875
Tang and The Velvet Underground and a bunch of

299
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:55,916
other different things.

300
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:56,296
And then we'd

301
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,797
At the end of the week, we'd gather everyone into a room,

302
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:01,959
we'd listen to everyone's pitches,

303
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,142
things like physical comedy and horrible voice acting

304
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:08,924
and weird props and visual aids were highly encouraged.

305
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:11,006
And none of these initial missions ended up in the game,

306
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:14,488
but I think that they were really useful for several reasons.

307
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:16,390
I think, for one thing,

308
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,392
they were really good at getting the team inspired.

309
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,974
It got them approaching problems in a very different way.

310
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:25,535
They weren't thinking, oh, well, what are we going to do?

311
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:26,995
This is a game, and I know how to design a level.

312
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:30,757
It was asking them to spring their ideas from a different place.

313
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,778
It was also a place for non-designers to be pitching ideas

314
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:36,739
and participating in this early process.

315
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:39,740
Programmers, animators, everyone we had on the pre-production team

316
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,060
was a part of this process.

317
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,301
I think maybe one of the most valuable things was

318
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:46,222
it was a place where outrageousness and humor were really encouraged.

319
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:49,211
There's always a lot of laughter.

320
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:53,214
We gave a crappy vintage blacklight poster each week as a prize for the best pitch.

321
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:59,359
And I think it created a really safe place for people to pitch ideas and be absurd and

322
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,941
put out ideas that they might not normally be comfortable pitching.

323
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:08,128
I'll just say this, in my previous six years at Insomniac, I never heard a mission pitched

324
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,693
that related to dating or girlfriends.

325
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:15,918
And I would guess that 20 to 25 percent of the missions that got pitched during this

326
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:19,623
process either had to do with getting a girlfriend, keeping a girlfriend, or dealing with an

327
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,304
ex-girlfriend.

328
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:27,158
And then lastly, it helped Marcus and I really quickly and publicly to find what that box

329
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:29,880
of the game was.

330
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,462
After each pitch, we basically just talked through, okay, we liked this part, we didn't

331
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:39,765
like this part, and it created this very nitty gritty of, okay, that humor you're talking

332
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:43,147
about, it's sort of, it's kind of grossed out humor.

333
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,887
We're going more for satire.

334
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:50,493
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense that there's this green bus that travels through this post-apocalyptic

335
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:54,536
world where you can get on and drive around and drink and shoot at enemies.

336
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:55,918
But that's okay.

337
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,099
That totally fits.

338
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:57,820
That'll be great.

339
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,785
And it was also a place for Marcus and I to publicly disagree about what the game was

340
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:03,265
supposed to be.

341
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,747
Sometimes, you know, one of us would say, yeah, that totally fits.

342
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:08,870
And then I'd say, no, I don't think it does.

343
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,051
And we...

344
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,515
instead of waiting and talking about it later, we would actually have a conversation in front of the team and

345
00:18:13,515 --> 00:18:20,601
we wouldn't get in fist fights, but we'd have a debate sometimes about, like, that seems just over the edge to me,

346
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:24,344
or no, that doesn't seem appropriate, and go through this.

347
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:29,629
These worked for us. When we were pitching the game, we were talking a lot about rock and roll.

348
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:36,235
Less from a sense of music, which confused people for a while.

349
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:39,178
People were, you know, are we going to be carrying like a guitar

350
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:42,281
and rhythm matching games to destroy mutants?

351
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:44,063
But we were talking more about an attitude.

352
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:46,205
And so we figured pitching these songs,

353
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:47,687
getting people to listen to this kind of music

354
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,730
would help people get into that sense of that feeling.

355
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:54,672
And I think it's worth thinking about what in your project,

356
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:56,113
it might not be rock songs,

357
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:59,315
but thinking about sort of bringing people

358
00:18:59,315 --> 00:19:00,235
from a different perspective.

359
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,757
I don't know, like, what else you could do,

360
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:03,537
but, like, it'd be awesome to see,

361
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:05,658
like, do aromatherapy missions for Assassin's Creed

362
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:08,259
or something, like, what a sandalwood splinter cell level

363
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,140
would look like.

364
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,701
And if there's one thing that really created

365
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:11,781
the light bulb moment for the team,

366
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:12,682
it was our respawn animations.

367
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,372
I was working at home on Sunset Overdrive writing docs and I had on a TV show in the

368
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:33,894
background that was sort of a survey of classic horror movies.

369
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:39,776
And in really quick sequence they had a thing where Dracula comes out of a coffin and then

370
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:41,877
Frankenstein's getting electrified and waking up.

371
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:44,399
and then the classic zombie coming up from out of the dead.

372
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,281
As soon as I was thinking about the game, I was like,

373
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:49,683
you know, these are all... these are respawns.

374
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,645
These are, like, these are coming back from the dead.

375
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,947
And I started thinking, I was like, you know,

376
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:57,530
this is kind of, in single-player games, in our game,

377
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,931
it's a free space.

378
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,574
There's... you die, and then there's a reload sometimes,

379
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,255
or there's not, but then you spawn back in,

380
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,057
and what happens in that period?

381
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:09,218
doesn't really change the mechanics of the gameplay.

382
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:11,779
And it seemed like a cool little space

383
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,900
in which we could fit a little vignette

384
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,162
or something that created a tone for the game

385
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:19,422
and sold the tone of the game.

386
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,432
I went in the next day and talked to one of our animators, Steve Reiter, about this idea,

387
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:29,355
pitched this idea of, you know, what if when the player dies, we go and there's just all

388
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:32,737
of a sudden there's a coffin there and there's flowers and candles around and the player

389
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:36,159
bursts out and comes back to life that way.

390
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,022
In typical Steve fashion, he went really nuts with it.

391
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,503
I'm going to play this video.

392
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:47,787
It's got, within about a week, we had all of these rough respawns done and actually

393
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:50,608
in the game, and then it's followed up with how a lot of these.

394
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:53,504
ended up in the ship game.

395
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,443
And it really completely transformed how the team understood what we were aiming for.

396
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:04,085
You know, months of Marcus and I saying, fun trumps realism.

397
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:07,848
If it's fun and it doesn't make sense, don't worry about it, we'll get it in there anyway.

398
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,229
I don't think it was really registering.

399
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:13,892
I think the song missions were doing good, doing a good job at getting people out of

400
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:17,554
the typical head space and taking baby steps for that.

401
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:22,377
But these respawns really created a different shift, and I think it's because in just a

402
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:22,897
few seconds...

403
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:26,779
they did encapsulate what we wanted Sunset Overdrive to be about.

404
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:30,961
We wanted them to be nonsensical and humorous and self-aware,

405
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:33,762
referential of our real world and real pop culture,

406
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:35,363
not just the internal world of Sunset Overdrive.

407
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:38,204
And people came up and they were like,

408
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:42,166
oh, you guys mean to say we can do anything in Sunset Overdrive?

409
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,247
You mean we can do anything?

410
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,028
And I'm not entirely sure what made them so successful.

411
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:49,109
I think part of it is that encapsulated bit.

412
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,930
But I also think it's a way that really quickly

413
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,271
basically took an animator.

414
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:56,833
you know, a few days and a programmer probably a couple hours

415
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:01,297
to actually get these in the game. And at the, at that point we were still so focused on

416
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:04,699
just getting the core mechanics good and we were in this ugly gray box world and there

417
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:07,902
there was no tone to the game other than just trying to get something

418
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:11,104
working. It was a really easy way that in this,

419
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:14,506
in this rough form, you still get it. You still get sold on the tone.

420
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:19,870
And it was a great lesson to me of, wow, if you can even get just the smallest detail

421
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,872
of feeling and tone in there.

422
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:25,594
then every time people are playing these ugly prototypes of the game,

423
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,736
every time they die, they still get that reminder of,

424
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:32,599
oh yeah, eventually, all this detail is going to get mashed and that tone is going to be there.

425
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,721
So I think getting some, something early in,

426
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,143
or something easy and early can, even if it's an irrelevant detail,

427
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:41,485
like respawning, can make a big difference.

428
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:48,066
So near the beginning of production I read an article called

429
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,429
Less Talk More Rock by the Super Brothers and it dealt with a couple

430
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:52,130
different things but the

431
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,234
the thing that I got out of it is they were talking about Jordan Mechner's theory of

432
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:57,595
game design which is

433
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,176
you know usually people

434
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:01,739
get inspiration and then they talk about

435
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,600
about what they're going to do for a really long time.

436
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,002
and then after they've talked for a really long time, they rock.

437
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,183
They start actually making the game.

438
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:09,924
And Jordan Messinger said,

439
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:13,325
you should get inspired and then make it.

440
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,426
And then once you've started making it,

441
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,167
then you can start talking about it.

442
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,809
And it allows you to build momentum

443
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:22,430
off that initial inspiration.

444
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,851
But it also, I think more importantly,

445
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:26,572
it actually gives you something to talk about.

446
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,233
I personally am not a big fan of theory crafting, where...

447
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:33,417
particularly with action games where it comes down to a visceral feel

448
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,460
and you can sit there and argue about it all the time,

449
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,063
but once you get it in the game,

450
00:23:39,063 --> 00:23:42,646
it gives people something to actually have an opinion about.

451
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:45,529
And so we'd consider ideas and discuss them briefly,

452
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,731
but our default perspective was that

453
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:51,094
any answer to a problem was the fastest way to find the right answer.

454
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:52,675
And we took this really seriously.

455
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:56,237
We pretty much dropped the idea of design docs,

456
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,198
or much documentation at all.

457
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:00,699
Most of our design docs would be either, you know,

458
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:03,560
four or five bullet points of this is what this should do,

459
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,281
or just a conversation, or maybe a whiteboard drawing,

460
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,963
and we'd take a picture and forward it around to the team.

461
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:12,255
And, you know, it allowed us to really speed up

462
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:13,515
the iteration with which we worked.

463
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:15,756
We had a style meter gauge in the game

464
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:19,097
where the more you connected traversal

465
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:22,419
and the more you killed things while you were traversing,

466
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,959
the higher your style would go,

467
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,100
and then it would unlock these different abilities.

468
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:32,475
And we went through easily half a dozen iterations that had nothing to do with each other, like

469
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:35,737
how you got this style and what happened when you triggered this style and whether or not

470
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:38,479
you triggered it or it happened automatically.

471
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:43,683
And it took us, I don't know, probably six weeks to eight weeks to...

472
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,545
to find even one that we kind of liked.

473
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:49,067
And we still did dozens of smaller iterations on it,

474
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,589
but not getting slowed down by that documentation.

475
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:54,832
Just having these really quick and easy conversations.

476
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:57,294
None of those were documented, again,

477
00:24:57,294 --> 00:24:59,336
by more than just, let's have a conversation

478
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,798
or let's go to the whiteboard and draw a diagram

479
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,179
of how this might work again.

480
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:08,853
And it also gave us more space to allow the team to follow their own passions.

481
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,376
If someone had an idea that we weren't certain about,

482
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,780
we'd usually give them some time to pursue it anyway.

483
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,403
It led to a lot of failures, which isn't surprising,

484
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:20,507
but it also led to some really massive features and...

485
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:24,369
really, really huge changes in the game.

486
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,031
I'll talk about the traversal in a little bit.

487
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:30,812
But even things like the reintroduction of Insomniac's,

488
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,093
you know, crazy weapons.

489
00:25:32,093 --> 00:25:34,294
I was determined to make an Insomniac game

490
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:38,816
that people talked about anything other than crazy weapons.

491
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,977
But we gave a guy...

492
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,498
He pitched the idea of a...

493
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,539
the high fidelity of a gun that shoots vinyl records.

494
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:48,520
And we were like, that is the worst idea ever.

495
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,861
Like, A, we said no crazy weapons.

496
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:53,422
B, when we said rock and roll,

497
00:25:53,422 --> 00:25:54,943
like, you're so on the nose,

498
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:56,544
that's not what we're talking about at all.

499
00:25:56,544 --> 00:25:59,865
But he was really passionate about the idea.

500
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:01,706
We gave him a day or two,

501
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,887
and he, you know, got it in the game.

502
00:26:02,887 --> 00:26:04,267
We went over and we were like...

503
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:08,631
All right, we'll have crazy weapons in the game.

504
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:10,494
And a lot of different fundamental features

505
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:12,276
came as a result, again, of a lot of times

506
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:13,337
just giving people a day or two

507
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,119
out of their schedule

508
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,342
to work on something that they were passionate about.

509
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,346
And then I do want to mention something

510
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,948
that didn't work for us is...

511
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:31,710
A few years ago I saw Stone LeBron Day talk about visual design docs and using these kind

512
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:39,134
of very graphic and pretty poster-like things instead of these written word docs to convey

513
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:42,956
at a high level what designs were and just that they were attractive and people liked

514
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:45,097
having them around and people actually looked at them.

515
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:51,979
I was like, this is great. We can, we can, you know, we're talking about this attitude of rock and roll.

516
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:58,126
We can make like rock flyers that explain at a high level what Sunset Overdrive is supposed to be about.

517
00:26:58,126 --> 00:27:03,711
And I think that they could work for maybe for DLC or a sequel, but when we were,

518
00:27:03,711 --> 00:27:06,494
we didn't have any idea what we were doing.

519
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:12,683
updating a word doc is hard enough, but when every other day we were changing how the character

520
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:16,464
moved, trying to give people the time to go in and mess around with a bunch of Illustrator

521
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,464
files and come up with a new poster, it just didn't work out.

522
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:22,745
But it's something that I'd like to explore again on a game that's a little bit more settled,

523
00:27:22,745 --> 00:27:25,386
but that was unfortunately one of our failures.

524
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:28,047
So Game Jams, this is sort of the ultimate form of our Less Talk More Rock.

525
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:39,192
I'm sure everyone knows what a game jam is. I know a lot of companies use them.

526
00:27:39,192 --> 00:27:43,059
But we did a couple two to three day jams when we were still pre-production

527
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:44,842
where everyone could do whatever they wanted.

528
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:48,072
could be something on paper.

529
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:49,813
It didn't actually even have to be in the game.

530
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:52,775
They just had to show their work at the end of the period.

531
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:55,276
Some of these were super hyper-focused

532
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:56,237
and really technical.

533
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:57,878
Some were really high concept.

534
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,740
Some explored really small features or different game

535
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,040
modes.

536
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,141
And most of them, after the two or three days,

537
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,543
didn't make a big impact on the game.

538
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:08,965
But a few of them really did make some big detours

539
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:10,606
and changes to the game.

540
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,428
And one of the best examples of this is our world design.

541
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:16,974
You know, we talked about, we had watched the Tekkonkinkreet anime,

542
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:23,184
and we're like, yeah, we want to make this awesome, beautiful, crazy city that doesn't entirely make sense.

543
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,014
But if you look at the gray box world that we were building in,

544
00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:28,715
it basically looked like you were looking out

545
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:32,358
of our office windows at the suburban Burbank, which

546
00:28:32,358 --> 00:28:34,099
is so boring.

547
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:35,921
And one of our designers, Josue Benavidez,

548
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:38,743
took on the task of always something interesting.

549
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:41,785
And he was inspired by both the movie Tech on Concrete

550
00:28:41,785 --> 00:28:44,487
and the sense of place that he got in games like Skyrim,

551
00:28:44,487 --> 00:28:47,330
where he felt like there was either always something

552
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,911
in the distance that he could see that

553
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:50,712
made him want to go there.

554
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:53,054
Or if he couldn't see something, if he saw a path,

555
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:57,018
They had encouraged and then delivered on the promise of

556
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:59,540
if I go up that path, there will be something cool

557
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,723
even if I can't see it right now.

558
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:04,345
And so, here's a section of what he built over,

559
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:08,249
over two or three days. This is while we were still on PC.

560
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:10,792
So, it's a little bit hitchy in the video, but...

561
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:17,013
a completely different kind of city than how we had before. It's one based on all this exaggeration,

562
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:21,916
you can see it's multi-layered, it's not built on a grid, it's got all these crazy waterfalls that

563
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:26,459
don't make really any sense but look cool. And it was great, the state of the architecture hadn't

564
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:32,243
even really clicked in with me, I was so focused on, yeah, we're working on mechanics and not paying

565
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:37,346
a lot of attention to the background, but it was bugging Ho's way and he stepped up and made this

566
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:40,668
little thing in a couple days and as soon as the whole team saw it we were like...

567
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:45,260
All of us, we were like, yeah, that's what we need to be making.

568
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,102
We live in Burbank.

569
00:29:46,102 --> 00:29:48,769
That's not where we want the fantasy of this game to be.

570
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:53,366
And that was the first step towards getting to a city that

571
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:54,926
looked more like this.

572
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,207
And I think it was a great way to inspire the team.

573
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:01,808
It was letting them have some free time in a single block to

574
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:03,068
work on what inspired them.

575
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:06,009
And I think, and I hope that they saw, that if an idea

576
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:09,530
resonated, we didn't waste any time at all in adopting it.

577
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,771
And in this case, it meant completely rebuilding Sunset

578
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,992
City, which we ended up actually doing four or five

579
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:19,733
more times from scratch to find the right combination.

580
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:24,721
of verticality and this sense of feeling kind of grounded,

581
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:27,225
but also a little bit of a fantasy land.

582
00:30:30,604 --> 00:30:35,407
And so those are some of the tools that we used to actually figure out what we wanted from the game,

583
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:39,089
to communicate that to the team and try to get them inspired.

584
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:48,514
But I want to talk a little bit about conviction and then talk about a few specific things that we did on the game

585
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:55,538
and my role and my conviction of those things, some of which was sometimes right and sometimes wrong.

586
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:58,059
And I said earlier, you really have to believe.

587
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:01,600
Obviously, in the core of the game, you have to be the person who believes in the process

588
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,080
of the game.

589
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,622
But the thing that I was not expecting to have difficulty with, but I did, was this

590
00:31:07,622 --> 00:31:12,424
idea of, yeah, I have to be the one who's champing, like, this is the way we're doing

591
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:12,504
it.

592
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,445
We're in good shape and we're going in this direction.

593
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:20,287
But then at some point, having to make really hard left turns or right turns and not...

594
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:25,986
not feel like people thought that I was crazy or I didn't know what I was doing.

595
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:30,188
Especially when I, you know, I'd been fighting with someone for a couple weeks

596
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,148
and they were really sure that their way was right

597
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:34,629
and I was really sure that my way was right.

598
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:36,970
And I was like, we're doing it my way, we're doing it my way.

599
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,711
And then at some point I'd be like, yeah, you're right.

600
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:40,972
We're doing it your way.

601
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:44,073
And I think the thing that helped diffuse those arguments a lot

602
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:46,854
was, went back to the less talk, more rock.

603
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,975
Whenever we...

604
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:54,768
had a disagreement, you know, I would choose how to proceed. And it wasn't always my way. If I was,

605
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:59,671
if I was not sure, or I was kind of like, I think this is the right way, but you seem really

606
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:03,272
confident that this is the right way, or that person had more experience with a particular

607
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:07,894
aspect of designing games, then we would try their way. But we'd say, let's get in the game,

608
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:12,556
let's build it. If either one of us doesn't like it, we can just come back and revisit it. And I think

609
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:14,277
It kept the engine moving.

610
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:17,339
We didn't spend a lot of time talking about it.

611
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:20,301
It gave them agency so that if we did put something in

612
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:24,544
and they didn't like it, they had an open door.

613
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:28,327
Am I really that close?

614
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:30,348
Whoa, you freaked me out.

615
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,450
They just gave me the five-minute warning.

616
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,871
I've still got almost 30 minutes.

617
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,933
I didn't think I was that off.

618
00:32:40,714 --> 00:32:44,276
And, uh, sorry, I lost my place here a little bit.

619
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,238
Um, and the other thing is, you know,

620
00:32:46,238 --> 00:32:48,460
honestly, most of the time,

621
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,642
whenever people are disagreeing and having conversations,

622
00:32:51,642 --> 00:32:53,664
if you get something playable,

623
00:32:53,664 --> 00:32:57,367
you tend to build consensus really quickly.

624
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:58,548
If a bad idea goes in,

625
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,770
there's usually not a lot of disagreement

626
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,511
about whether or not it's a bad idea.

627
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:03,712
And a lot of first ideas...

628
00:33:04,053 --> 00:33:05,394
are bad ideas.

629
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:07,856
Um, you know, the difficult thing

630
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,818
is when you're like, you both agree,

631
00:33:09,818 --> 00:33:13,322
okay, this is a good idea, but my idea is a great idea,

632
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:14,743
and so we should go to that.

633
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,086
Um, but even, again, with the less rock,

634
00:33:17,086 --> 00:33:18,968
less talk, more rock, a lot of times

635
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:20,169
we had the time to then...

636
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:24,968
sort of take a couple steps towards that other idea and figure out,

637
00:33:24,968 --> 00:33:26,850
okay, is that a direction we do want to head or not.

638
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,494
So I want to go through a couple specific instances that we,

639
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:33,756
from Sunset Overdrive.

640
00:33:33,756 --> 00:33:35,678
This encapsulates really everything I'm talking about,

641
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:40,483
specifically about my conviction about these things and

642
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:43,586
probably how wrong I am about most of them.

643
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:46,236
So when we first started creating the game,

644
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:49,358
I think the game design had not really caught up to that,

645
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:52,580
that tonal shift from moving from the

646
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,861
I Am Legend sunset overdrive,

647
00:33:53,861 --> 00:33:56,382
or this, you know, Gorillaz sunset overdrive.

648
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:59,344
We'd moved this more stylized and subversive tone,

649
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:01,425
but, you know, we'd been talking about this game

650
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:03,586
for a couple of years before we actually started making it,

651
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:03,987
and I think...

652
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:08,376
I just started getting enamored of certain design choices.

653
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:10,879
I just fitted these different puzzles together.

654
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,701
This is going to be a great mechanic.

655
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:17,145
And maybe it would have, but I don't know that it was fitting what we were trying to

656
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:18,026
make anymore.

657
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:24,450
Tonally we kept talking about being about speed and action and aggressiveness, but mechanically

658
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,212
we were what I call skinny guy gears of war.

659
00:34:28,212 --> 00:34:33,754
It was about hiding and taking cover, but instead of being like a linebacker, it would

660
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:35,054
basically star me.

661
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:40,096
And so I could move a little bit quicker, but it was a very different sense.

662
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:42,678
of a game than having this aggressiveness.

663
00:34:42,678 --> 00:34:47,041
And almost right away, people started bringing up skateboarding,

664
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,602
which Mark and I shut down right away.

665
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:54,426
We thought it had too much baggage, both culturally and other games having been made.

666
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,268
You know, like, Tony Hawk's an awesome game.

667
00:34:56,268 --> 00:35:00,331
We're going to make this giant game with a shitty version of Tony Hawk in it,

668
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,431
and everyone's going to come and say,

669
00:35:01,872 --> 00:35:04,073
Yeah, this is a game that has a shitty version of Tony Hawk in it.

670
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:06,675
And even then, people wouldn't drop it.

671
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:09,477
I'm going to click forward and start a movie.

672
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:12,099
It starts with Josue Benavides,

673
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,482
the guy who did the city earlier.

674
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,963
And the next game jam,

675
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:19,604
he made skateboarding without a skateboard.

676
00:35:19,604 --> 00:35:21,205
He called it, I think, street surfing.

677
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,767
I think he was hoping that we wouldn't notice

678
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,888
that if there was no actual physical skateboard,

679
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:26,910
that it was skateboarding.

680
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:33,516
And then it progresses from there through a bunch of the different prototypes that we made

681
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:37,400
while we were figuring out what traversal was going to be in the game.

682
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,705
And again, this came out and we were like,

683
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,266
no way, we are definitely not doing this.

684
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:49,603
We didn't want to have these little situational moves, so you're running and maybe you could

685
00:35:49,603 --> 00:35:54,064
jump on an oil slick and slide a little bit quickly to if people were chasing you or something

686
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,045
like that.

687
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:59,406
So the designer who was working on those, Cameron Christian, he was working on these

688
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:04,969
little small moves, but he wanted to make those more expansive and really make the player

689
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:05,769
a lot more agile.

690
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:08,190
He was really passionate about this.

691
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,311
We kept saying, you know, we're not feeling this.

692
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:13,052
This is not what Sunset Overdrive is about.

693
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:17,983
If you guys, while you're making these little moves,

694
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:20,669
if you guys want to spend a day or two messing around

695
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:22,433
with some of your things, you can put them in

696
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:25,801
and we'll look at them and yeah, you got that time.

697
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:29,322
And so they worked on it, and then we looked at it, and we're like, yep,

698
00:36:29,322 --> 00:36:32,783
this isn't working, this isn't where we want to go, but

699
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:36,703
as long as it's here, this is what we don't like about what you have here,

700
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:40,004
so why don't you take a day or two and fix that.

701
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:43,404
And we just kept on going like that for quite a while,

702
00:36:43,404 --> 00:36:45,825
like giving them a couple days a week

703
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,425
for probably a couple of months.

704
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:52,386
And it became more and more about, we were improving what was there,

705
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:54,927
but we kept caveating every time they would bring it back, like...

706
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:59,486
We're gonna let you guys keep working on this, but you know that eventually we're gonna say,

707
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:03,488
this is not the game, and all this work can be thrown away, but if you guys feel passionate

708
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:04,728
about it, keep working on it.

709
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:11,311
And then one day I woke up and said to myself, you know, you keep saying that aggressiveness

710
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:16,593
and velocity are what this game is centered on, but that's not what it feels like at all.

711
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:19,434
And so I came in that day and I was like, all right.

712
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:24,645
Traversal is what this game is all about. We're totally going in that direction now,

713
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:29,147
but we're definitely not going to traverse and shoot at the same time.

714
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:34,568
And I'll spare you the details, but a few months later we were traversing and shooting.

715
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:38,789
And that really became the absolute mechanical center of Sunset Overdrive.

716
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,591
Then we spent the next few years fighting for traversal and combat.

717
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:48,656
There's a lot of work. We were doing, you know, trying all these different moves.

718
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:52,278
We were doing a ton of usability tests to see if people understood what they were wanting to do,

719
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:53,779
if they could deal with the controls.

720
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:59,742
We were having to rebuild our entire city again to enable this traversal.

721
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:04,625
I'm just going to start this over, because otherwise you're going to look at a black screen for 30 seconds.

722
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:13,567
And we were having to rebuild our camera and the way our shooting model worked in order to work with this traversal system.

723
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:18,850
And it was still very much a mess at the point that we hit when we had to say,

724
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:24,793
all right, we are either going to do this or we're going to go back to kind of the original idea.

725
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:25,173
And...

726
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:32,098
It was kind of a scary time because it wasn't fun and it wasn't very cool.

727
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:35,380
But we thought, this is different.

728
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,202
We said we wanted to do something different with the game.

729
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,944
We have some time to make it better.

730
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,385
And everything sucks at first.

731
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:45,667
And if we could do it, it would be really cool.

732
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,269
And so at the point where we were like, all right,

733
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:50,731
we do have to rebuild all these things to make them work.

734
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:54,122
It was definitely not clear that that was the right direction.

735
00:38:54,122 --> 00:38:57,703
There were a lot of people both at Insomniac, not all, but a lot of people at Insomniac

736
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,344
and Microsoft who were not into this idea.

737
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:05,626
And some were, but more than a few people came up to me and said, you are taking whatever

738
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:09,447
chance this game has to be good and ruining it by making this decision.

739
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:14,650
But I think this is a perfect case of how development is supposed to work.

740
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,772
You know, I'm not the smartest guy in the room.

741
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,753
I'm not the best designer at Insomniac.

742
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:23,396
I think my job is basically to get the best designers to do their best work,

743
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:27,118
and then I'm fortunate enough that I get to come in and cherry-pick the best of that best.

744
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:30,660
and figure out how those things fit together.

745
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,043
And we give just enough rope to this guy that we worked with,

746
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:35,243
we trust, we respect,

747
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,645
that he was able to get something working.

748
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,766
And we still didn't really like it at first.

749
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,448
We didn't hate it either, and we gave him a little bit more time.

750
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,289
And eventually we did see the potential of it.

751
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:45,030
And I think that...

752
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:48,232
It was a great lesson for me of, you know, if you give,

753
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:51,814
if you give people with good instincts that you trust

754
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:53,755
some free space to experiment,

755
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:56,516
it really can have this, this...

756
00:39:56,516 --> 00:40:00,358
I can't overstate the massive impact

757
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,100
that these experiments that Cam and Ross and Steve did

758
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,780
on the game.

759
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,782
It would be a much more boring

760
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:10,643
and probably not very cool game if we hadn't done that.

761
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:16,886
So the next thing I want to talk about is our character customization system, what we

762
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:18,627
call our vanity system.

763
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:23,810
And this is something that Marcus and I locked in on immediately, and this was one of the

764
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,571
things that we never ever wavered on.

765
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:29,794
And one of our first decisions was, we want people to be able to express themselves in

766
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:30,554
the game some way.

767
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:34,737
Clothing seems like a very obvious way.

768
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:37,558
It's something that, you know, if you're playing a multiplayer cooperative,

769
00:40:37,558 --> 00:40:40,320
it's the thing that you always carry around with you.

770
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,322
And we had this central theme in Sun Tzu

771
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:45,864
that we described as be who you want to be.

772
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:51,205
And it was a manifestation of something that I had read in a Steven Pressfield book, Turning Pro.

773
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:56,606
If you guys haven't ever read, this is actually the sequel to a book called The War of Art.

774
00:40:56,606 --> 00:41:00,587
Steven Pressfield's the guy who wrote The Legend of Bagger Vance.

775
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:08,689
But these two books are about how difficult it is to be a creative person and how to be a better creative person.

776
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:13,590
But it had this part that was... well, I'll read it to you and you will understand what it says.

777
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,610
So this is from Turning Pro.

778
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:18,916
The tribe doesn't give a shit.

779
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:24,201
The amateur dreads becoming who she really is because she fears that this new person

780
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,942
will be judged by others as different.

781
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:30,246
The tribe will declare us weird or queer or crazy.

782
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:32,428
The tribe will reject us.

783
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:33,569
Here's the truth.

784
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:34,750
The tribe doesn't give a shit.

785
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,251
There is no tribe.

786
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:41,553
That gang or posse that we imagine sustaining us by the bonds we share is in fact a conglomeration

787
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:45,253
of individuals who are just as fucked up as we are and just as terrified.

788
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:49,314
Each individual is so caught up in his own bullshit that he doesn't have two seconds

789
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:53,215
to worry about yours or mine or to reject or diminish us because of it.

790
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:57,276
When we truly understand that the tribe doesn't give a damn, we're free.

791
00:41:57,276 --> 00:41:58,977
There is no tribe and there never was.

792
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,297
Our lives are entirely up to us.

793
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,018
I think it's a little bit easier said than done and I would say that anyone who has ever

794
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:09,440
been on the internet would say that there actually are plenty of people who are not

795
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,202
caught up in their own bullshit, that they have plenty of time to reject and diminish

796
00:42:12,202 --> 00:42:13,143
all of ours.

797
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:17,506
But it was a good statement and the spirit of that was something that we wanted to get

798
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:18,547
into Sunset Overdrive.

799
00:42:18,547 --> 00:42:22,991
I'd also been obsessively watching this Bill Cunningham, New York.

800
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:27,074
It's a documentary about Bill Cunningham, the New York Times street photographer.

801
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:33,687
And Mark and I were talking about how strictly society judges appearance.

802
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,692
You know, I think a lot of people think of fashion as sort of silly.

803
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:38,752
It's just your appearance.

804
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:41,774
What difference does an outfit change make?

805
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:46,316
And yet I think the barrier to getting like probably an average dude in America

806
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:50,779
to get in like a fist fight or maybe start a war is probably much lower

807
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:55,221
than getting an average guy in America to go out in public with a skirt on.

808
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:58,783
By the way, I love that I'm saying this on the wear a kilt day.

809
00:42:58,783 --> 00:43:01,745
I didn't know it was wear a kilt day and I was walking around this morning early, early.

810
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:05,207
I saw three guys in kilts in the hall and I twittered.

811
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:08,308
I was like, this must be, is it wear a kilt day?

812
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:09,769
And it turns out it actually is.

813
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:12,011
So guys with skirts.

814
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:15,453
And it's fascinating to us that an article of clothing

815
00:43:15,453 --> 00:43:16,853
can have so much power.

816
00:43:16,853 --> 00:43:18,895
And in the movie, Mr. Cunningham says,

817
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:21,116
the wider world perceives fashion sometimes

818
00:43:21,116 --> 00:43:22,697
as a frivolity that should be done away

819
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:25,398
with in the face of social upheavals and problems that

820
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:26,259
are enormous.

821
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:28,460
The point is, in fact, that it's the armor

822
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,361
to survive the reality of everyday life.

823
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:35,519
And so we had, we said we're going to have all this crazy stuff for people to wear.

824
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,324
We're going to allow and hopefully encourage people to, at least in the game and in the

825
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:42,248
sort of the safety of the game, let their inner freak flag fly.

826
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:46,554
We're going to have different body sizes, different genders, different races.

827
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:51,558
We're not going to designate any clothing or hairstyles or makeup as male or female.

828
00:43:51,558 --> 00:43:53,759
Everything is wearable by anyone.

829
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:59,142
The last production question that we had was Gavin Gould, our lead character, artist came

830
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:04,405
to me and said, so we can either do 20 beards that work on guys or we can do 10 beards that

831
00:44:04,405 --> 00:44:05,025
work on everyone.

832
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:07,386
I was like, how can you even ask this question?

833
00:44:07,386 --> 00:44:09,487
We're right at the finish line.

834
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:15,450
But the most controversial decision that Marcus and I made with the fashion was that we said,

835
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,653
There's absolutely no stats associated with it.

836
00:44:19,653 --> 00:44:21,014
We didn't want people to feel like,

837
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:22,495
I have to wear the Robin Hood hat

838
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:25,458
because it gives me plus two agility.

839
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,819
And I can't tell you how many meetings we had

840
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:30,161
where sometimes it was really the whole design team

841
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:31,102
and they're arguing with me.

842
00:44:31,722 --> 00:44:33,543
People are not going to care about this stuff

843
00:44:33,543 --> 00:44:37,045
if there aren't stats attached to it.

844
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,866
And eventually it switched from arguing to begging.

845
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:42,227
Please let us put stats on this stuff.

846
00:44:42,227 --> 00:44:43,608
We need it from a mechanical standpoint.

847
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:46,249
We need this to create meaningful progression.

848
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:48,130
But to us it wasn't about mechanics.

849
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:50,411
It was about this theme and this idea

850
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:53,273
and this point of view of wanting people

851
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,934
to feel a certain sense of freedom in the game.

852
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:56,254
And their defense was a long, long, long time

853
00:44:56,254 --> 00:45:00,837
before people were going to care about this stuff.

854
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:07,046
it became even a little bit clear that this was going to work.

855
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:10,789
It wasn't until, I would say, by E3 of last year,

856
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:14,813
probably two and a half months before we went gold,

857
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,394
we probably had about, at that point,

858
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:19,316
we had maybe 15% of the options in the game at that point.

859
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:22,919
It was also the first time we really showed the game publicly, but...

860
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,043
All of a sudden people, people started, people at E3 were like,

861
00:45:27,043 --> 00:45:29,106
oh, this is really cool, I can dress in these different ways,

862
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:32,929
and I can do these different things and, and, and present myself in these different ways.

863
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:39,256
And even though it, it, people were like, yeah, maybe this is going to work.

864
00:45:39,256 --> 00:45:41,718
It really wasn't apparent until, until the game shipped.

865
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,332
that people were going to be in it, be into it.

866
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:47,074
It wasn't something that was easy to playtest.

867
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:49,897
All the stuff was coming on at the last second.

868
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:51,519
A lot of these clothing things

869
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,441
are things that you have to earn over time.

870
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:57,265
It was something that was very difficult to measure

871
00:45:57,265 --> 00:45:58,487
as we were making the game.

872
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:02,410
A number of people after the game came out were complaining that the Xbox didn't have

873
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:07,815
a screenshot tool or were taking pictures of their TV with their phone or capturing

874
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:09,596
videos and then taking screenshots off that.

875
00:46:09,596 --> 00:46:13,219
And it was really cool to see the diversity of how people dress.

876
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:18,183
Some people came out looking like they just walked straight out of Banana Republic or

877
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:19,064
J. Crew.

878
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:22,287
And some people looked like they just walked out of Burning Man.

879
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:26,851
And that was actually one of the debates, particularly with Microsoft, was...

880
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:31,657
you know, how much J. Crew are you talking and how much Burning Man are you talking?

881
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:35,662
They were really concerned that we have enough plain white Ts in the game.

882
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:41,269
But then one of the nicest things and one of the things that we were hoping

883
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:44,012
would happen was a post on NeoGAF.

884
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:46,273
And a woman wrote,

885
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:47,495
I wanted to play as a guy,

886
00:46:47,495 --> 00:46:49,918
because I usually love to dress them more than women.

887
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:52,621
But since I'm a girl and the body proportions are true to mine,

888
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:53,542
I definitely was making a girl.

889
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:56,906
Plus they have my afro that I actually have.

890
00:46:56,906 --> 00:46:58,888
It felt like an enlightening experience.

891
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:00,691
Insomniac so far is the only developers

892
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,913
who have blessed me with my actual hairstyle.

893
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:03,734
I cried, lol.

894
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:07,759
and that's really cool. I think that's awesome.

895
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:11,562
And I certainly wouldn't ever want people, you know,

896
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:15,945
I don't want to feel like I want to feel in this game because

897
00:47:15,945 --> 00:47:18,968
I'm going to shoot a little bit more accurately or my foot speed's

898
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:22,851
going to be a little bit quicker. And I think that, you know, Mr. Cunningham talks about

899
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:23,551
fashion being

900
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:27,334
the armor to survive everyday life, but I'd like to think that it can be a little bit

901
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:30,997
of a weapon against conformity and tradition and that it

902
00:47:30,997 --> 00:47:33,539
can provide, in a safe space, a...

903
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,205
a place for, to experiment and for more guys to wear skirts.

904
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:45,828
And then the last feature I want to talk about is our night defense missions.

905
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:49,609
You remember at the beginning of the talk I was talking about this I am legend idea

906
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:53,690
of you've got a scavenger in the day and then the big action part of the game would be at night

907
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,592
when all these enemies, these hordes of enemies come running in.

908
00:47:57,592 --> 00:47:57,672
And

909
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:04,549
that initial idea of this is the high action point of the game, this is this really part

910
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:11,053
of the game, I think got a little bit ossified in my mind. It was the first thing that we

911
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:15,777
started prototyping because it was very action oriented. It was the first thing that was

912
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:19,980
fun in the game because it was action oriented and we were spending a lot of time, we were

913
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,103
working on AI built around this, we were working on defense related mechanics and trap systems

914
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:28,526
and individual traps and defense related economies and UI and training and all this stuff built

915
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:30,147
around the night defense.

916
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:33,688
It was also a way that we had something fun.

917
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:37,789
Something to show to the team, see we can do something right.

918
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:44,671
But the feedback that we started getting from play tests once we had more of the game put

919
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,272
together was really, really odd and confusing.

920
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:51,753
The fun scores for the knight defense were the highest in the game.

921
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:55,575
You know, you read, do-do-do, and knight defense, do-do-do, knight defense, do-do-do, knight

922
00:48:55,575 --> 00:48:56,315
defense.

923
00:48:56,315 --> 00:49:00,216
And they would go down a little bit in successive defenses, but they were still, even the low

924
00:49:00,216 --> 00:49:04,177
knight defenses, were still higher than the rest of the game at that point.

925
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:08,279
But at the same time, the narrative comments started to get kind of negative after the

926
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,799
second or third knight defense.

927
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:11,219
This is getting repetitive.

928
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:13,020
I'm not really liking this.

929
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,962
I didn't know what to do with that.

930
00:49:15,962 --> 00:49:18,204
They were saying, I'm not really liking this,

931
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:20,625
but they're also saying, based on the numbers,

932
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,127
but I'm still liking this better

933
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:24,348
than anything else you guys are doing in the game.

934
00:49:24,348 --> 00:49:27,191
And we kept working on it,

935
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:29,492
and the playtest,

936
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:32,254
the results kept coming back the same.

937
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:35,537
And rather than doing what I should have done,

938
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:38,399
which is step back and looked at it more

939
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:40,040
as a game as a whole.

940
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:45,838
We did the opposite, where we started looking at each individual night defense and saying,

941
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,682
okay, well, why aren't, why are people not liking this night defense?

942
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:55,507
Despite the fact they're saying that they're having fun, they're saying they're getting

943
00:49:55,507 --> 00:49:58,930
tired of it, so how do we make them not tired of it?

944
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,253
And then we got our, we had a mock review done for the game, it was, I think,

945
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,173
Well, we got the game running start to finish in order to get this mock review done.

946
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:11,876
It was the first time that you could play from start to end of the game.

947
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:17,760
There are a couple, definitely still a couple places you had to squint.

948
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,322
But this guy just loathed the night defenses.

949
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,924
He hated them.

950
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:28,475
It was, again, it harkened back to this, like, why?

951
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:31,538
People keep saying this is fun, but they don't like it.

952
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:35,062
And I said, OK, well, I need, I obviously

953
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:38,646
need to go and figure out what this guy experienced.

954
00:50:38,646 --> 00:50:40,588
So I walked out a few days.

955
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:42,550
I went and locked myself in a conference room.

956
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,091
I'm going to play through the game start to finish

957
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:45,593
and get the experience that this guy did.

958
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:51,359
And after about the second or third night defense, I was ready to kill somebody.

959
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,462
And unfortunately, the only real person I had to kill myself was myself.

960
00:50:55,462 --> 00:50:58,583
I was like, Jesus, there are a lot of these.

961
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:00,044
And this was really late in production.

962
00:51:00,044 --> 00:51:05,388
This was probably early July, mid-July, when we were going gold at the end of August.

963
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:07,990
It didn't leave a lot of options.

964
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,393
We did some serious triage.

965
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:12,115
We went that day, we went from having

966
00:51:12,115 --> 00:51:14,198
eight of these in the game to five.

967
00:51:14,198 --> 00:51:17,141
They went from seven to eight minutes in length

968
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:21,146
to three to four minutes in length.

969
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:23,469
We added mid-night checkpoints.

970
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:29,559
But, you know, you can probably imagine that when they were eight-minute segments, and

971
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:35,224
if you failed, we actually sent you all the way back, and it was, it was really frustrating.

972
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:39,227
All these, all these decisions that, when you're playing just that little part of the

973
00:51:39,227 --> 00:51:42,610
game, it's like, oh, yeah, I played five minutes and I failed, and I'll just play it again.

974
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,674
But whenever, in the context of playing the whole game and I want to get to the next thing,

975
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:48,655
it was really, really frustrating.

976
00:51:48,655 --> 00:51:51,378
I'm still kind of torn on them, because I still like playing them.

977
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,816
I think that they are sort of the great high action part of the game.

978
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:59,557
And it's sort of like my first love of Sunset Overdrive.

979
00:51:59,557 --> 00:52:05,640
But I think that that was a place where my conviction got really misguided.

980
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:12,162
And I kept thinking about them as representing something from this original idea of the game

981
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,163
and not realizing that.

982
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,442
the game had gone from this sort of systematic we're gonna go back and forth

983
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:18,982
between day and night but

984
00:52:18,982 --> 00:52:20,163
too much more

985
00:52:20,163 --> 00:52:23,244
every mission that you're doing in sunset overdrive has something special

986
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:25,785
about it maybe you're defending a boat

987
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:28,747
uh... and were introduced a new enemy and there's a a new weapon

988
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:35,216
or the leader of the scouts has drunk overcharge

989
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:40,058
and transforms into this dragon boss that you're battling.

990
00:52:40,058 --> 00:52:42,098
And that after all that switch,

991
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:45,300
this ended up being sort of, despite being very high action,

992
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,280
ended up being the repetitive part,

993
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,501
and I think to a lot of people

994
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:53,343
one of the more boring parts by the end of the game.

995
00:52:55,613 --> 00:53:02,077
So this is a video of how Sunset Overdrive ended up.

996
00:53:02,077 --> 00:53:05,018
And Marcus and I wanted Sunset Overdrive to have a point of

997
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:08,460
view and feel different from the Sea of Grey and AAA

998
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,301
games out there.

999
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:13,082
We had never made an open world game.

1000
00:53:13,082 --> 00:53:13,962
We had never made.

1001
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,728
There are a lot of things about this game that were different for Insomniac, and it was...

1002
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:24,194
I think that was great in encouraging us to try a lot of different processes

1003
00:53:24,194 --> 00:53:26,338
really quickly, see what worked, see what didn't work.

1004
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:27,599
And it's worth noting...

1005
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,824
It's like the worst end to the video. I'll play it one more time while I...

1006
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:31,946
finish talking.

1007
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:37,356
You know, there are tools that we used that worked

1008
00:53:37,356 --> 00:53:39,478
at certain points of the project and not others.

1009
00:53:39,478 --> 00:53:42,800
The Less Talk More Rock works great when you have 20 people.

1010
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,362
When you have 120 people, some of whom are in Burbank,

1011
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:47,804
some of whom are in our offices in North Carolina,

1012
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:50,646
and a bunch of people up at Microsoft working on it,

1013
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:51,947
it starts not working so much.

1014
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:54,169
And we would still use it for, you know,

1015
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:56,951
particular aspects of the game, honing in on them,

1016
00:53:56,951 --> 00:53:59,413
but adjusting on that.

1017
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:02,315
I think it's helpful to think about what processes

1018
00:54:02,315 --> 00:54:03,816
are going to work best for you.

1019
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,953
or your team, are you really methodical or a little bit more

1020
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,511
fly by the seat of your pants?

1021
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:11,272
Does your team like certainty,

1022
00:54:11,272 --> 00:54:13,133
or do they like experimentation?

1023
00:54:13,133 --> 00:54:16,615
You know, is the demographics of your team

1024
00:54:16,615 --> 00:54:18,916
tight enough that you can just sort of assume

1025
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,977
that people understand what you're talking about,

1026
00:54:20,977 --> 00:54:22,758
or do you need to do something like movie nights

1027
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:25,459
to create this vernacular that everyone speaks?

1028
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:27,960
And do you trust your team enough sometimes

1029
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,382
to just let them run amok and see where they go?

1030
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:32,643
And I think things work best

1031
00:54:32,643 --> 00:54:34,564
whenever we were having fun making the game.

1032
00:54:34,564 --> 00:54:36,325
And, you know, I...

1033
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:38,975
The game, I'm really proud of it, I'm really happy with it.

1034
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:42,718
It was the first game I ever made that, when it came out,

1035
00:54:42,718 --> 00:54:45,019
like, publicly, I actually took the week off and I went home

1036
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:47,321
and I sat down and I played it start to finish,

1037
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:49,943
despite having played it many, many times before.

1038
00:54:49,943 --> 00:54:52,864
And I think my biggest lesson, though, was that,

1039
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:55,746
as someone who's pathologically neurotic and loves to control everything,

1040
00:54:55,746 --> 00:54:59,849
it became really clear to me that the less,

1041
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:02,711
the more I let the reins go on the team, the better things went.

1042
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,784
You know, we definitely had a bumpy ride at the beginning,

1043
00:55:06,784 --> 00:55:09,165
trying to figure out where to tell people to go,

1044
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:11,565
but as we started including people

1045
00:55:11,565 --> 00:55:14,326
and having them help us decide where that was,

1046
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:16,046
both by asking us questions

1047
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,266
and getting involved in the process,

1048
00:55:17,266 --> 00:55:20,007
but also the kinds of things that they were bringing up,

1049
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:22,968
or even mechanically, things like the traversal system,

1050
00:55:22,968 --> 00:55:24,588
at some point it became really,

1051
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,808
I think Marcus and I had the easiest job in the building,

1052
00:55:26,808 --> 00:55:28,089
because it was just like, we were like,

1053
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:29,649
that's where we're going,

1054
00:55:29,649 --> 00:55:32,390
and everyone walked there on their own power.

1055
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:37,972
And, you know, we were there to occasionally nudge people or we'd say, you know, the target has shifted a little bit.

1056
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:44,876
But I think the best decision that we made with Sunset Overdrive was that there wasn't a huge sense of logic

1057
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:47,598
and there weren't a lot of limits on what people could do.

1058
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:52,420
And I think Insomniac is a really talented team. We're a little bit quirky team.

1059
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,623
I sometimes call us the island of misfit toys of the games industry.

1060
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:58,404
But it really allowed, I think, the team members to...

1061
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:00,445
let their own freak flags fly,

1062
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:04,368
and put thousands of unique bits of themselves in it,

1063
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:06,590
which ultimately is why I, or what I think made

1064
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:10,593
sensitive overdrive really successful.

1065
00:56:10,593 --> 00:56:10,953
That's my talk.

1066
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:18,259
And I think we have like five minutes for questions?

1067
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:21,452
No.

1068
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:21,953
Yes.

1069
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:21,993
OK.

1070
00:56:21,993 --> 00:56:22,073
So hi.

1071
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:24,974
Great presentation, by the way.

1072
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:26,154
It was very interesting.

1073
00:56:26,154 --> 00:56:27,915
I have two questions for you.

1074
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:31,856
First one being, at which point in the production process

1075
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,577
did you actually need it?

1076
00:56:34,577 --> 00:56:37,578
Did you feel that you had the experience that you

1077
00:56:37,578 --> 00:56:38,959
were looking to get?

1078
00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:41,099
So that's question number one.

1079
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:45,241
And question number two, after this point has been reached,

1080
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:48,582
what was the flexibility that you guys allowed yourself

1081
00:56:48,582 --> 00:56:50,263
to have to change stuff?

1082
00:56:51,123 --> 00:56:55,507
maybe late in the production process?

1083
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,950
I think, so the first question was when did we have

1084
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,452
sort of the player experience that we felt was

1085
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:06,037
what the game was going to be?

1086
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:07,538
Probably like two years into the three-year cycle.

1087
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:09,260
It was pretty late.

1088
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:13,620
You know, we were building parts of the game.

1089
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,921
And there were a lot of things that ended up still working.

1090
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:17,802
And we were building enemies and weapons

1091
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:20,162
that no matter what we ended up doing with Traversal

1092
00:57:20,162 --> 00:57:22,523
and things like that, that those things still work.

1093
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:25,865
We might have to modify them a little bit.

1094
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:29,106
But it was pretty far in before I think we really...

1095
00:57:30,439 --> 00:57:33,721
felt, before the game felt the way it was going to feel.

1096
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:35,583
I think probably around a year and a half in,

1097
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:37,845
we were like, that's the direction that we're going to go.

1098
00:57:37,845 --> 00:57:40,487
You know, we had, we had at the time,

1099
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:43,529
we honestly, we had an E3 coming up for our announce,

1100
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:45,271
and so it was like, okay, are we going to be

1101
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:47,032
hiding behind cover in the E3 trailer,

1102
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:47,613
or are you going to be?

1103
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:51,816
you know, running around on telephone wires.

1104
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:53,517
And at that point, that was the kind of,

1105
00:57:53,517 --> 00:57:55,238
we don't have time to go back.

1106
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,859
As far as the flexibility,

1107
00:57:56,859 --> 00:57:58,020
we actually had a lot of flexibility,

1108
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,222
because once we figured out what we were doing,

1109
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:03,124
it's actually really easy to make all this stuff.

1110
00:58:03,124 --> 00:58:07,867
You know, the city got built up and torn down.

1111
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:14,347
missions we're getting every time we do a mission, it got quicker and quicker.

1112
00:58:14,347 --> 00:58:15,528
And just like any game,

1113
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:17,710
as things work,

1114
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,772
making things with those things that work

1115
00:58:19,772 --> 00:58:22,135
gets easier and easier. So

1116
00:58:22,135 --> 00:58:26,820
I think we maintain a lot of flexibility and we were making still some pretty

1117
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,262
significant changes up to the last minute to try to make the game

1118
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:30,623
as close to what we wanted as possible.

1119
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:38,283
In the period where you're game jamming and you're throwing in lots of things and the team is kind of going in

1120
00:58:38,283 --> 00:58:43,466
Disparate directions your code base and your asset base can get kind of like muddled and crazy

1121
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:48,250
How did you contain that did you build an extra time to refactor and get it back to stable?

1122
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:50,852
Or what did you do in that situation? I have no idea

1123
00:58:50,852 --> 00:58:57,296
Yeah, I'm the least technical person. I'm actually lucky that they let me out of the office with a laptop

1124
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:01,171
I don't know. And I know that, I know that, you know, it tended to be the programmers

1125
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:05,813
who would go in and get into the code. And there were only three or four of them on the

1126
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:09,855
team at the time. Most of the people would, if people were trying to do something that

1127
00:59:09,855 --> 00:59:13,116
was code related, they would have to team up with the programmer. The designers were

1128
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:17,178
using, you know, a lot of times just hacking together things with scripts that were easy

1129
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,199
to tear back out. And I'll say at that point.

1130
00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:22,964
we were still working in a lot of just, like,

1131
00:59:22,964 --> 00:59:25,827
literally gray boxes and that kind of thing.

1132
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:29,711
So there wasn't a lot that we felt was, like,

1133
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:31,492
at the base of what the game...

1134
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:34,075
We had, like, hero movement and some really basic AI,

1135
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:36,877
but I don't think there was a whole lot to get messed up,

1136
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:39,259
at least the point of, like, our first jam.

1137
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:39,820
Anything else? Cool.

1138
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:40,681
Thanks, guys. Thanks for coming to check it out.
