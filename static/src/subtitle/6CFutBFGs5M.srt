1
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:05,917
Welcome, good morning.

2
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:09,600
Thank you so much for coming out to the talk today.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,402
I was really curious, or have been really curious,

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:16,225
to know who would be coming out early in the morning

5
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:17,786
on a Wednesday at a games conference

6
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:19,327
for a talk about curation.

7
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:22,289
And you are those people.

8
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:22,890
That is you.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,193
And so obviously that means that you are the best people here

10
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:29,094
and the people who care about video games the most.

11
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:30,155
So well done, everybody.

12
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:34,955
So, yeah, so my name is Marie Folston.

13
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:39,019
I am a playful curator and producer of,

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,322
or playful curator and producer.

15
00:00:42,263 --> 00:00:44,225
And so I'm somebody who's been working

16
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,907
for the past sort of eight years or so

17
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:48,429
as a curator in and around video games

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,432
and playful digital interactive works.

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:58,499
The majority of the work that I've done in this space over that time has been sort of quite grassroots or independent,

20
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:04,505
and it's specifically been involved with the exhibition and display of independent and alternative video games,

21
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:11,112
and that has specifically been work that I've undertaken as part of a collective that I'm the co-founder of

22
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:14,816
and co-collaborator with, which is World Rumpus.

23
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:19,959
So you can see some photographs here of some of the work and the projects that I've undertaken

24
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:25,581
previously but that is not really the work that I'm going to talk about this morning

25
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:31,143
because sadly I don't have, we've got 30 minutes today and I don't think in 30 minutes I can

26
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:35,824
quite unpack or explain why two grown men are stood in a paddling pool.

27
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:39,266
riding around with move controllers tied to their limbs.

28
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:45,569
So if at the end of the talk when you get the surveys asking you to rate the talk if it's highly rated enough,

29
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:48,830
then I promise I'll be back next year to unpack and explain that.

30
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:54,993
But yeah, so I'm not really here today to talk about the work that I've done as part of World Rumpus,

31
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:59,735
although that's something that I very much consider to be part of my curatorial practice.

32
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:04,222
Instead, I'm here to talk to you about the work that I've been undertaking over the past

33
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:07,488
four years at this institution, at this place.

34
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:13,995
So if you're unfamiliar, this beautiful building that you're looking at is the Victorian Albert

35
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:20,438
Museum in London. This is one of the world's largest museums of design and it's a museum

36
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:27,161
that's really interested in design process. And I've been really fortunate to have the opportunity

37
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:33,204
and the privilege to have worked here for the past four years as their curator of video games.

38
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:42,514
And that work across that time has been primarily spent working as the lead curator of a major

39
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:49,543
exhibition that took place at the museum from September 2018, and it closed a matter of

40
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,525
weeks ago on February 24th, 2019.

41
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:59,752
And that exhibition was, as you can see, was Video Games Design Play Disrupt.

42
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:07,517
This was a major exhibition that looked at video game design through a very sort of contemporary lens.

43
00:03:07,877 --> 00:03:11,279
Although the exhibition has closed, it's one that is going on to tour internationally.

44
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,381
It's going to be opening at V&A Dundee.

45
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:19,003
on the 20th of April this year before going on to visit other institutions internationally.

46
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,984
So if you've not had a chance to catch the show, then hopefully you will bump into it

47
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:27,806
at some museum or gallery on its travels around the world over the next sort of few years.

48
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:36,959
So whilst I stand here today as the lead curator on that exhibition, I have to acknowledge obviously that this is a project that has taken a roundabout from end to end.

49
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:45,265
This took four years to undertake and it's a project that was realised with the work and dedication and contribution of a team of hundreds.

50
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:50,888
This is a project that sort of encompassed project curators, conservators, interpreters,

51
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:58,213
conservators, designers, builders, editors, filmmakers, academics, developers, games designers

52
00:03:58,253 --> 00:03:59,614
who lent their works to the show.

53
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:04,717
And so I've put up here just a few of the names from some of the key contributors to

54
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:05,498
the exhibition.

55
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:13,261
who worked on that project over the years, that creating an exhibition is a complex and complicated task.

56
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:17,342
So just to call out a few of the really key people that worked on the exhibition,

57
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:21,103
so Christian Volzing, who was the exhibition's research curator,

58
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:27,910
curatorial partner in crime, especially our exhibition management team, Samantha King,

59
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,795
Annabelle Martinez, Ruth Law, and Tessa Pierce. And our exhibitions management team are really

60
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,298
sort of the producers of the exhibition, and they were an absolute

61
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:42,944
This is a powerhouse of a team that pulled off an incredibly impressive and complex feat with this exhibition.

62
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:47,109
We're really fortunate to work along some amazing designers, who are exhibition designers,

63
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:52,695
Penelo Orstedt's studio and Squint Opera, who undertook the AV design of the exhibition,

64
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,419
and also Julia, who did our 2D and our graphic design.

65
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:02,734
So, often this is the point in when I'm talking about the exhibition that I'm normally lobbying

66
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:09,641
for sort of, to lobby to audiences about the value or the impact of video games in museums,

67
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:13,584
but stood here at the Game Developers Conference, I don't feel that you're an audience that

68
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:19,050
really needs to be one round about the virtues or the significance of video games as a really

69
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,773
fascinating and important contemporary design discipline.

70
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:28,875
But still video games within cultural institutions such as the V&A is still rare and unexpected and unusual.

71
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:33,657
But for any institution that is engaging with design or contemporary design,

72
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:40,219
video games are a hugely significant force within our culture today.

73
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:45,560
And as such, they are a medium that institutions need to be engaging with and embracing.

74
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,861
There are an estimated 2.2 billion people in the world today.

75
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:52,203
who play video games. That's a quarter of the world's population.

76
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:57,766
And when we look at the fact that, say, the 2017 finals of the League of Legends

77
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:58,727
World Championships

78
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:02,089
took place in the Beijing's Bird's Nest Arena

79
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,491
or stadium, which is an Olympic stadium that has a capacity of

80
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:10,554
80,000, we can see the scale and reach of video games and it's undeniable.

81
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:13,695
And we also see these cultural spaces that video games now occupy.

82
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,036
But...

83
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:19,070
When we talk about or try to justify video games through these numbers,

84
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,771
we're really only looking at the medium from afar.

85
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:26,512
We're looking at it through this sort of sense of scale of reach of an industry.

86
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:31,354
And those facts and figures to me don't necessarily do the work that is needed

87
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:36,756
to begin to open up or to really manifest and make sort of visible

88
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:40,137
what is so fascinating and unique about video game design.

89
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:47,942
And so in the very early stages of the exhibition, I worked a lot to try and find a core quote or concept or an idea

90
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:55,087
that to me got to the sort of fundamental aspects of what makes video games such a unique and fascinating discipline.

91
00:06:55,892 --> 00:07:00,137
And I came across this quote which was a line from Frank Lantz's talk Hearts and Minds,

92
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:03,080
which is a really great talk from GDC that he presented in 2014.

93
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,983
And this is a quote that says,

94
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:09,948
Making games combines everything that's hard about building a bridge

95
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:12,831
and everything that's hard about composing an opera.

96
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,514
Games are operas made out of bridges.

97
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:18,298
This is a really confident and bombastic statement.

98
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:22,704
Here we're aligning video games with the sort of cultural heights of operas

99
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:27,610
and with equally forms such as these essential forms such as engineering.

100
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,835
But for me, not just that confidence in this statement,

101
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,019
but also the fact that this is a statement that allows us to view video games.

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,106
As this system, this sort of cultural form that sort of embodies this subjective emotional aesthetic design,

103
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:46,552
but also this objective system design of systems of engineering of rules.

104
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:50,036
And there is a fascinating tension where those two points meet.

105
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:54,180
And for me, that is what we wanted to get to the heart of in this exhibition.

106
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,103
to evoke and instill in people what is so important and unique.

107
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:02,266
And equally for me, this space, when we were able to reduce video games

108
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,867
to sort of the fundamentals or to their basics,

109
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:08,630
I think it gives us a little bit of breathing space to understand

110
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,532
or to perhaps envisage much broader horizons about the discipline.

111
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,215
It allows us to cast off some of the assumptions, the stereotypes,

112
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:20,377
or some of the hang-ups that perhaps sometimes sort of overshadow the discipline.

113
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:24,762
And so this is the first quote that people come to when they come to the exhibition,

114
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:26,625
when they first see when they come into the exhibition.

115
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:31,611
So it's an exhibition that was seeking to really challenge people's expectations.

116
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,014
This is an exhibition that sought to take risks.

117
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:41,470
And for one, this is a show which was deciding to not look back over nostalgic, retro past.

118
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,872
Instead, we're looking at video games from the here and now.

119
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:47,755
We're looking at a period of time from the mid-2000s through to the present day.

120
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:52,599
The reason why we decided on that specific time frame is that, sort of, within the mid-2000s,

121
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:57,863
we have a whole host of technological catalysts, from smartphone to broadband to social media,

122
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,146
all of which have had a radical, radical impact on the way that games are designed,

123
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,388
the way that they're discussed, and the way that they're played.

124
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:10,739
Equally, this was an exhibition that was trying to find a new curatorial language for video games.

125
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,564
We wanted to look beyond video games purely as a playable object,

126
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:20,413
to find new ways of opening up and making visible this as a fascinating design medium.

127
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:42,362
And one of the things that is particularly surprising is that one of the first objects that was ever confirmed as alone for the exhibition was in fact a painting, this Magritte painting that you can see, the blank signature, which formed sort of a key inspirational touch point for this scene in Carble Computer's game Kentucky Route Zero.

128
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:51,867
And for me, this is something that speaks to what is so intrinsically valuable about bringing video games into spaces such as museums.

129
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:58,570
It is not to say that aligning video games alongside painting, alongside these established artistic masters,

130
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,953
it's not to say, great, now video games are elevated to some lofty sort of space, now these are culture, now this is art.

131
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:09,175
Instead, it's to show how video games, as a contemporary discipline,

132
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:13,477
it does not sit as some sort of isolated cultural design discipline.

133
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:18,359
It is intricately connected to this long history of visual arts,

134
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,041
of literature, of culture, that it is a continuation of the subjects,

135
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,903
and the mediums, and the disciplines that sit within the spaces such as the V&A.

136
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,144
And so, now I'm just going to show you a short video,

137
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:34,527
which just perhaps gives you an insight into the way that the space was realized.

138
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:39,383
If it's going to play.

139
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:55,839
So that gives you just a bit of an overview into the sort of space of the exhibition and

140
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,159
what we undertook with the show.

141
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,102
So as I said just shortly before, this was an exhibition that was seeking to identify

142
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,003
and find a new curatorial language for video games.

143
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:11,445
And for that we wanted to look beyond the game as a playable object, to decentralise

144
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,966
that as an object for an exhibition.

145
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:19,230
Because bringing video games into museum spaces and exhibiting it is a complex, complex thing

146
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,650
to do.

147
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,573
Because inherently, we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

148
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:28,916
We're bringing video games, a medium that is plural, a medium that is ephemeral, a medium

149
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:35,039
that is digital, into an institution whose entire structures and infrastructure is centered

150
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,982
around valuing the sort of physical object, around sort of objects that exist sort of

151
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:42,403
materially, that have this sort of singularity.

152
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:50,280
And through that we have this sort of conflict of the way in which we can perhaps sort of view a game in that space.

153
00:12:51,316 --> 00:13:03,179
And playable games in terms of an exhibition space, it's not to say that I completely sort of disagree with the idea of bringing a game as a playable work into an exhibition as being the best means to display it, but it's really a question of context.

154
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,220
This is an exhibition that wanted to open up video games as a design object.

155
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:20,743
And so say if we bring a video game into that space, an object that might take upwards of 30 hours for you to play it before you can really realize or see that as a design object, do you as a visitor have time to have that engagement with that work?

156
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:22,843
Equally, we have issues of capacity.

157
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:25,484
How many people can play a video game in a public space?

158
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:28,205
We also have issues of literacy.

159
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:32,346
Who comes in with the skills and the knowledge of how to play and interact with a video game

160
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:35,908
in order to be able to perceive it or experience it as a design object?

161
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,509
And that's equally to speak of the fear of performance within a public space, that people

162
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:43,390
feel that pressure of performing or playing a video game in public.

163
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:49,726
So if we're not looking at the video game as the sort of key object and we want to find

164
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,851
a new curatorial language, what does that look like?

165
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:52,773
How do we approach this?

166
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:59,298
And this way sort of comes back to looking at sort of other areas and other disciplines

167
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:04,741
and the way that they have approached exhibiting different design disciplines or equally games.

168
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:11,184
And a really key inspirational work for me is the series by Harun Faroqui, Parallels

169
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,545
by Wontofor.

170
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,608
And this is a series of video installations that the artist created.

171
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:23,051
And when you experience this artwork, you are really surrendering your autonomy as a

172
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,293
player to be able to play these games.

173
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:29,798
It's work that actually showcases a series of playthroughs of key games like Red Dead

174
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:31,079
Redemption or L.A. Noire.

175
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,505
And what you're watching is the artist playing these games in this very intentional and considered

176
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:37,806
way that's very choreographed.

177
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,526
but almost seemingly a little bit irrational.

178
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:44,227
In his playthroughs, he's sometimes repeatedly pushing NPCs

179
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,108
to sort of push their behavior to respond in a different way.

180
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:49,229
He's repeatedly sort of approaching them

181
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,409
and sort of pushing their behaviors.

182
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,629
Or he's sometimes going through games

183
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,770
with a thick sort of specific path

184
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,411
that he wants to travel through sort of any one landscape,

185
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,111
but frequently coming up against the invisible walls

186
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:02,872
or barriers that sort of are in place in that game

187
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:06,233
to sort of direct or divert sort of players into other areas.

188
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,500
And by watching these playthroughs, by watching this, Timmy,

189
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,161
it begins to...

190
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:15,001
You begin to see, as a person watching this artwork,

191
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:17,582
you begin to see the seams in these video games.

192
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:19,482
You begin to perceive the materiality.

193
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:22,683
You begin to see sort of the considerations and the decisions

194
00:15:22,703 --> 00:15:24,163
that the designers have had to have made

195
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:25,844
to be able to create those works.

196
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:27,604
And this installation, for me,

197
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,945
is perhaps one of the most inspirational installations I've seen

198
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,506
because it has explained to me or presented to me...

199
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:41,915
A video game as a designed object in an exhibition space far greater than actually any exhibition

200
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:46,000
that I'd been to that actually tried to do so through the playable works.

201
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:51,592
And so again, it's looking at spaces or concepts like this of how we can consider curation.

202
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:55,633
And I think for me as a curator, that is really where my provocation starts from.

203
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:59,635
That's where my practice is centred at the moment, is understanding that you as a curator

204
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:03,236
take on the responsibility or the role of a player.

205
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,777
That it is your responsibility to look at a video game, to identify what playthrough,

206
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:11,298
what way or what lens do I want you to understand or appreciate this work.

207
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:20,232
So the exhibition was one that was broken across three key sections and those key sections

208
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,333
were, the first was new designers.

209
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,656
This was a section in the exhibition which is perhaps a slightly more traditional approach

210
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:30,318
to the way that the V&A would normally display design disciplines.

211
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:35,041
It was a space where we looked into the design discipline or the design practice of eight

212
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:36,943
key contemporary video games.

213
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:43,927
It was a very eclectic range of games that were sort of from different genres, that were

214
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:49,691
from designers of different scales, so from big AAA blockbusters to small independent studios.

215
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:56,375
They were games which all had different design ambitions, but the thing that unites every single

216
00:16:56,555 --> 00:17:00,838
game within this section, every single game in the whole exhibition, is that they're breaking

217
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,421
They're breaking new ground in some way, that they are groundbreaking,

218
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,944
they're pushing our expectations of what video games are or what they can be in new ways.

219
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:14,109
In Disruptors, the second section, we looked at the social and political conversations that

220
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:18,993
surround video games and understanding that if we're to really appreciate and respect video games

221
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:23,636
as a contemporary design discipline, we need to have the same critical and nuanced conversations

222
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:27,019
about that discipline as we do any other creative field or medium.

223
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:31,838
And the last section of the exhibition was sort of split into two halves.

224
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,761
And this is where we were looking at video games from the perspective of the player

225
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:41,806
and understanding that actually no story or no perspective on contemporary design in video games is complete

226
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:47,111
without also acknowledging or appreciating the design stories of the player

227
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:51,694
and acknowledging that the way that many players interact with video games these days

228
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:53,836
transcends the role of the designer.

229
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:59,451
And so we have one sort of space players online, which was looking at the modes of creativity

230
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:04,773
that players engage in mass online games, but equally players offline, where we look

231
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:09,915
at the rise of the DIY arcade scene of games that are of niche, of DIY games of spectacle

232
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:10,656
and performance.

233
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:15,397
But I have limited time this morning to talk you through an exhibition that has been sort

234
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:16,518
of four years in the making.

235
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,719
So instead, I'm just going to talk you quickly through one of the games in the first section

236
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:25,260
in New Designers as a bit of a case study about the way that we decided to approach

237
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,601
that and to just sort of show you the approach that we took with curating that.

238
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:36,123
So the first game that you come to in the exhibition is Journey, a 2012 game by That

239
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:36,943
Game Company.

240
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:39,363
And the video is not playing.

241
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,403
This is normally the point where I say, I don't know why I choose to work with technology

242
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,085
when technology chooses to not work with me.

243
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,666
Imagine this video was playing.

244
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:54,368
I'm assuming this is an audience that has a lot of familiarity of that video game.

245
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:58,691
So you're normally watching the character sort of surf down the sand dunes at this point.

246
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:01,913
So the first game that you come to in the exhibition is 2012's Game Journey by that

247
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:02,493
game company.

248
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:08,146
And this is a game, if you're not familiar, where you play as this robed figure,

249
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:13,289
traveling across this desert landscape, journeying towards this sort of mountain peak in the distance.

250
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:17,792
And as you play, you begin to come across other sort of players in the game as you,

251
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:21,875
these robed characters. And these are obviously not other NPCs in the game,

252
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,418
these are other players playing that game anonymously alongside you.

253
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,742
That game company, when they talk about their motivations for this game,

254
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:34,623
they talk about the fact that, at the time, they perceived the emotional spectrum

255
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,665
that was evoked in players through video games to be quite limited.

256
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:43,027
And they wanted to create a game that evoked different emotional responses in players.

257
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:47,548
They wanted to create a game that evoked feelings of love, of empathy, of companionship.

258
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:51,294
And so for us as curators, this was the approach that we took with this work.

259
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:53,518
How do we make visible that creative intent?

260
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:59,789
How do we showcase this as a game that really speaks of this independent design studio creating

261
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,712
this sort of ambitious, groundbreaking work?

262
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:08,777
And so the curation work that we undertook for many years

263
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:10,318
was a period of research.

264
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:13,521
It was reaching out to the designers of many of the games

265
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:15,603
that we exhibited in the exhibition.

266
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:17,545
And the thing that we asked them was

267
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:21,008
to open up their notebooks and hard drives to show us, OK,

268
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:25,592
we understand the game as this end work that you've created.

269
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,014
But what sort of materials and artifacts

270
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:29,675
existed from your design process?

271
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:35,628
And it's something that sort of for me speaks to the way in which we can consider the curation

272
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:40,055
of video games to be something that can take learnings from, say, a field such as architecture.

273
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:44,701
And it was something that one of my colleagues at the V&A said to me at one point about his

274
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:46,424
work as a curator in architecture.

275
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:46,764
He said, well,

276
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:52,902
As curators in architecture, we don't really ever collect architecture, we collect the

277
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:53,302
debris.

278
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:57,324
And what he's talking about there is not sort of—debris might seem like a dismissive

279
00:20:57,364 --> 00:21:00,424
term, but what he's talking about is the fact that architecture equally suffers with

280
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:05,226
these issues of complexity and scale within museum spaces, that there's a very sort of

281
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:05,286
a— . . . . . . . . . . . .

282
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:12,851
strong issues of a physical scale that show us why architecture is a complex medium to

283
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:17,014
bring into a museum, that you can't necessarily display many buildings inside another building.

284
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:20,897
And so instead this is a field that's had to work to identify different objects and

285
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:25,381
materials and artifacts that can be brought into an exhibition space that help to present

286
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:28,223
to a visitor and show that as a designed object.

287
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:33,376
And so we spoke with these different designers to get them to show this materiality of this

288
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,698
debris that existed from their design process.

289
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:41,403
And the object that you're looking at in front of you is a notebook from Journey's Robin

290
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:41,944
Haneke.

291
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:47,028
And for me, this was something as an object that I really loved that no matter which design

292
00:21:47,068 --> 00:21:51,953
studio, which designers we spoke to over the course of our research, so many of them would

293
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,674
still come back to the notebook.

294
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:58,658
And when we're trying to connect video games or align video games to these other cultural disciplines,

295
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,742
that there is perhaps no one single object which best communicates or illuminates

296
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:07,806
the fact that video games is still a medium that is still built around the same tools

297
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,350
or the same sort of practices as other design disciplines, as something such as the humble notebook.

298
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,774
It's also something which helps sort of remind us of the humanity of the personalities

299
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:21,397
of the people behind video games, which is something for me that is so important to convey.

300
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,192
And just to quickly talk through a few of the other objects that we have in this space.

301
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:30,975
So here we have some of the artwork, the concept art by the game's art director, Matt Never.

302
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:34,697
On the left-hand side we can see sort of the digital concept art,

303
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:37,479
which is one of the first paintings, a digital painting.

304
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,141
of the white light of the mountain, which is sort of this end point in the game.

305
00:22:41,181 --> 00:22:47,085
And here we see these small characters at the foot of this mountain, of this crevice.

306
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:50,787
And it's again evoking these feelings of feeling small in a space,

307
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:55,730
of that sense of awe and that need to sort of huddle together in the face of this huge obstacle.

308
00:22:56,231 --> 00:23:00,013
And we have the pencil sketches as well, which show Matt Nava's sort of design,

309
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,174
of thinking about the way in which the character of the game

310
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,436
would move through these environments in different spaces.

311
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,299
We also have the research as well of the team,

312
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,220
and this is a series of videos that the team undertook

313
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,440
when they went out to Pismo Beach to,

314
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,741
as they sort of, in their words,

315
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,241
they weren't going out to research to create a game

316
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:20,682
that was trying to sort of be sort of photorealistic.

317
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:22,142
They were not looking for sort of

318
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,802
photorealistic reality in the game.

319
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:25,683
They wanted it to feel real.

320
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,683
So they're going out to see what is it like

321
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,423
to jump down the side of a sand dune?

322
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:31,184
What is it like to sort of run across a sand dune

323
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,964
with your arms tied to your sides?

324
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:37,910
And again, this is an object in an exhibition space which helps just remind us of the sort

325
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,254
of people behind this work, so it puts faces to that.

326
00:23:40,614 --> 00:23:44,940
It reminds us of sort of the research that they undertake, and equally sort of quite

327
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,922
humorous in parts.

328
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:52,394
And equally, the prototypes of the game, that this is one of the early prototypes of Journey,

329
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:57,375
the dragon prototype, where we see two players traveling through sort of a level,

330
00:23:57,775 --> 00:24:02,877
and as they sort of come together, they're sort of able to, they sort of get this sort of white circle

331
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:06,357
that surrounds the players, which gives them the ability to surmount certain obstacles,

332
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,278
to be able to achieve things that they wouldn't.

333
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:13,639
So, again, looking at a prototype that, for many people who are unfamiliar with video game design,

334
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,300
this is something which is so visually strikingly different from the end game,

335
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,480
that...

336
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,106
It helps them to understand this idea of how games designers iterate their practice to

337
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:29,333
think about the way in which we set up these rules in these systems and do players and

338
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:32,537
do people actually react and respond in the way that we expect them to.

339
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,026
I'm also sort of taught romantically about the notebook as an object which can help sort

340
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:46,994
of unite people around this sort of sense of connection with video games as a design

341
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:47,515
discipline.

342
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:53,241
An object that sort of really resonated with a lot of visitors to the show was this spreadsheet.

343
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:57,870
Because I think in all honesty, no matter what discipline or what work you undertake,

344
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:03,455
there's perhaps no object that unites us greater than a really beautifully crafted spreadsheet.

345
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:08,559
And so this was the designers' attempt quite late on in the development of the game

346
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:11,061
to map out the emotional journey of the game,

347
00:25:11,081 --> 00:25:15,304
but to map that across the different layers and levels of the different aspects of the game

348
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:20,288
and the way in which they all worked to feed in towards this idea of the emotional journey that players would go through.

349
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:25,433
You can see at the top of this, this sort of curve that's been plotted out that actually

350
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:29,618
maps onto this idea of the hero's journey, if you're familiar with that as a graph or

351
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:33,702
as a concept of an emotional arc that people will progress through, through a narrative

352
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:34,363
or a story.

353
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:40,016
And so, all together, these are objects that we brought together into this space.

354
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:43,019
And here's a slide which sort of just gives you an idea of the way that these objects

355
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,620
were brought into the exhibition.

356
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,743
That to visitors coming into the show, that you have this ability to see at a glance or

357
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:53,427
to see in detail this variety of different materiality, the variety of different approaches,

358
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:58,250
the different objects, the different aspects that constitute everything that tells a much

359
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:04,455
fuller and a much richer perspective of Journey as a designed, as a complex design object.

360
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:09,526
And this idea of these sort of constellations of objects was something that was repeated

361
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:13,428
across every single game in that first section of the exhibition.

362
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:19,672
And sitting center of this sort of collection of objects was a central installation.

363
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:22,974
And the way that I talk about this is to think about this approach, is to thinking about

364
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:26,476
video game, to think about these displays as constellations.

365
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,318
That we have this sort of constellation of this debris, of this materials and artifacts.

366
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:36,423
that speak of the design process, but centered within that is this key installation, a sort

367
00:26:36,443 --> 00:26:41,127
of major point that commands attention, that provides an experience, that enables visitors

368
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,809
to see that game from a slightly different perspective.

369
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,513
And so these are the different installations that we created for each of the games in our

370
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:49,774
first part of the exhibition.

371
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:59,568
And for Journey, it comes back to the fact that as curators we wanted to show this game as one which was sort of really challenging the emotional journey, the emotional experiences of players.

372
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:07,834
And that's what this installation needed to communicate. We needed to present a way of them being able to see that video game, sort of in a moment or in a sort of brief glance,

373
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:13,978
that sort of the dwell time or anticipated dwell time of any visitor on any one installation is perhaps around about sort of five to six minutes.

374
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:20,082
And so the way that we created this was to create, to bring together two key scenes from the video game.

375
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,001
that sort of represented these two emotional sort of high points.

376
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:27,123
So we have this sort of sand surfing level, this sort of emotional high point,

377
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:32,046
this really rich sort of warm space with the sort of joy of surfing down these sand levels.

378
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:35,248
And at the end, we have this sort of a level from later on in the game

379
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:38,590
where you're sort of this character that's struggling up this mountain space

380
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,952
with the wind blowing you back, which to visitors enables them to see sort of this game

381
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:46,655
and these two emotional high points of this game sort of at a glance.

382
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:51,578
And in between each of those, we decided to create something

383
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:53,279
which allowed them to see a cross-section

384
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:54,160
of each of the levels.

385
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,641
And this was something that was inspired

386
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:57,962
by some of the concept artists

387
00:27:57,982 --> 00:27:59,502
that the studio had actually created.

388
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:01,263
And this is some of the early concept

389
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,804
or some of the concept art for the game,

390
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:04,765
which shows each of the levels in Journey

391
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,426
as sort of different cross-sections

392
00:28:06,846 --> 00:28:08,427
where you're allowed to see sort of the fact

393
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:09,728
that the curvature of the ground

394
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:12,169
actually represents sort of that curve of the,

395
00:28:12,729 --> 00:28:14,150
again, that sort of emotional graph

396
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,151
that players are expect or anticipated to feel

397
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,131
as they go through the game.

398
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:19,392
And so from that we created this...

399
00:28:19,913 --> 00:28:22,194
It's a shame that so many of these videos aren't playing, but...

400
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:25,635
...on the screen maybe? There you go.

401
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:27,276
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we've gone way too far.

402
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,417
Did it do it? Hooray, thank you.

403
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,478
So you can see here this sort of cross-section

404
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:35,480
of actually every single one of the levels in the video game,

405
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,081
which again is something that we created.

406
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,622
Not sort of independently as creators,

407
00:28:39,642 --> 00:28:41,943
we created this looking to the intentions,

408
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:43,604
looking to the design objects, the designers,

409
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,925
understanding what it was that they were seeking

410
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:47,325
to communicate through their work.

411
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:53,175
And choosing how to represent that, or trying to find a way that interpreted that game within a physical space,

412
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:58,625
that gave people the ability to view that game and to view it sort of as a designed object at a glance.

413
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:05,061
And so bringing all of these objects together is, for us, sort of, was a way to try and

414
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:10,727
sort of present to people and to show them these video games as these complex design

415
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:11,188
objects.

416
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:15,613
And so hopefully through all this sort of concept of this debris, this constellation

417
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:17,715
of objects and artifacts from the design process.

418
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:20,578
sort of alongside these sort of installations

419
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:23,440
that provide these different perspectives of video games,

420
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,423
that we hoped to give them a much fuller picture of that game

421
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:29,786
as a designed object that they perhaps would not have been able to gain

422
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:33,250
had they been brought into the space and just had to watch over someone's

423
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,313
shoulder as they play through the game. And so this exhibition was ultimately a

424
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:40,476
risk that we did something that sort of went against the norms of what people

425
00:29:40,516 --> 00:29:42,398
expect from video game exhibitions.

426
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:49,270
It's something that I hope other curators go on to do, that go on to build on this sort

427
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:54,092
of curatorial language that other people have set down before to try different radical ways

428
00:29:54,712 --> 00:30:02,375
of exhibiting this complex medium, but one that needs so much to have the breathing space

429
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:07,157
that museums and cultural spaces provide to illuminate and provide information and raise

430
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:09,158
the cultural literacy about video games.

431
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:17,685
And ultimately the response and the reaction that we've had from the games community about this exhibition has been one that has been frequently sort of positive and at times emotional.

432
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:28,174
With many designers just sort of saying that they find it so rare and unusual or unexpected to be able to see video games as they understand them and as they appreciate them within these contexts.

433
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:33,358
And that is why for me that it is so important to continue this work, to continue finding

434
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:38,641
different radical ways to explore video games within museum spaces, is to help raise this

435
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:43,424
cultural literacy, to help fill the vacuum and absence of knowledge of the way that video

436
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:49,167
game design exists, to be able to explore as well, to move beyond survey exhibitions,

437
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,548
to explore different niches and alternative histories.

438
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:58,377
So that is a very, very brief overview of just a small aspect of the exhibition, the

439
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:02,178
sort of motivations and approaches that we took to that, and the way that that was realised

440
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:02,798
in this space.

441
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:07,439
As I say, the exhibition will be opening up in V&A Dundee on the 20th of April and then

442
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:11,080
travelling internationally after that, so if you get the chance to see the exhibition

443
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,620
then please obviously do.

444
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:18,841
Also I noticed in the GDC bookstore that the exhibition catalogue is for sale, so please

445
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:21,762
do also pop over there and take a look at the exhibition catalogue.

446
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:21,902
And .

447
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:25,892
But yeah, thank you so much for coming out this morning and for taking time to listen

448
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:31,524
to the work and to embrace sort of ideas and conversations about video game curation.

449
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:32,065
Thank you.
