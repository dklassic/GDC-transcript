00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,551
When you have trouble making art for video games, where do you want to go?

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,831
Home.

3
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:08,092
Who do you feel like seeing?

4
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:09,153
No one.

5
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:11,774
How much time do you spend in the office?

6
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:13,335
Too much.

7
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,216
Bad art pipelines hurt in so many ways.

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,336
Sadness.

9
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:18,637
A loss of interest.

10
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:19,718
Anxiety.

11
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:21,859
TechArt Bootcamp can help.

12
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:27,821
TechArt Bootcamp is an all-day event at GDC 2019 that treats known symptoms of poor art pipelines.

13
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:48,631
If you've experienced poor distance field vision, saggy or unrealistic cloth, underperforming shaders, a buildup of tool cruft, confusion about production constraints, an inability to scale your tool's deployment, or have trouble keeping track of your data, then it may be time to come to the Technical Artist Boot Camp on Tuesday, March 19th, 2019.

14
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:57,217
Severe liver problems, never fatal, were reported. Signs include abdominal pain, dry mouth, and waking up in your hotel room not knowing how you got there.

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:02,351
Talk to your tech artists if you have too many scripts, or if it takes 16 hours to make

16
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:05,632
a build, as it may be a sign of a serious or deadline-threatening condition.

17
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:09,794
Side effects may include nausea, constipation, and drinking coffee later than you know you

18
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:10,054
should.

19
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,935
Tell your tech artists right away if your pipeline worsens, if your tools exhibit unusual

20
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,596
behavior, or you experience sudden bouts of rage against your machine.

21
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:21,997
Ask your recruiters about hiring tech artists.

22
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:23,558
Game development is tough.

23
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,018
TechArt Bootcamp can help.
