Hi guys, my name is Aviv and I'm the head of analytics at SocialPoint.

2
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:10,883
I will be talking in the next GDC about how you can use analytics to make your games better.

3
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:16,327
Specifically I will be sharing some lessons that we learned about how to do analytics

4
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:21,671
in a way that's very lean, lets you run very quickly with the game, lets you test things

5
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:25,955
with small user bases, and minimize the cost for your tracking.

6
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:26,715
See you there!
