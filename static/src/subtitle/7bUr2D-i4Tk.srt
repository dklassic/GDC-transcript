Hi, my name is Richard Atlas, and I'm one of the co-founders of Clever Endeavor Games.

2
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:08,522
We make a game called Ultimate Chicken Horse, which has sold well across many platforms,

3
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:13,186
garnered over 260 million views on YouTube, got nominated for an IGF award,

4
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:16,129
won a PlayStation award, and has generally been very well received.

5
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:20,504
I've been gathering a huge list of questions designed to challenge you and convince you

6
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,045
that we can be better leaders.

7
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:23,506
This talk is a little different.

8
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:26,147
It's not a story of success and it's not a story of failure.

9
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:28,688
It's not going to teach you a specific technical skill.

10
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:33,030
Rather, it's going to encourage you to look at your situation and force you to answer

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,052
some uncomfortable questions about your practices as a leader.

12
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:40,946
Together, we're going to admit our flaws, think critically about our practices, and

13
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,467
talk to each other about our situations.

14
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:43,888
We can be better leaders.

15
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,469
So join me on this journey at GDC 2019.
