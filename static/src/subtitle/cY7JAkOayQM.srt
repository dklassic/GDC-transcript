1
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:19,560
So I'm Austin, and I'm here to talk about this game called Stray Gods, which has not come out yet, which makes this a pre-release post-mortem.

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:27,425
And we'll see how that goes, how much of what I say turns out to have been bullshit by the time it ships.

3
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:34,330
And joining me, as you can see here with a lovely asterisk, is Mr. Troy Baker.

4
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,672
So just to address the elephant in the room here.

5
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:39,114
Hello everybody.

6
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:49,032
I am disappointed because I was very much looking forward to spending my very first GDC with you in such a great way to be able to have a conversation like this.

7
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:50,895
For me,

8
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:56,679
The notion of a post-mortem is probably very pedestrian and banal to you guys.

9
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:11,929
It became a very novel concept to me once I started participating in games like Bioshock Infinite or The Last of Us or Second Son and studios started bringing me in and go, we just want to kind of post-mortem with you and what is it that we could have done better and just we have some notes for you as well.

10
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,271
And it became a part of the process that I loved the most.

11
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,051
So being able to

12
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:30,596
talk to you guys about the things that we learned, the mistakes that we made, and some of the accomplishments and the discoveries that we made through this process is a conversation I'm very, very excited to have with you in any way possible.

13
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:41,138
I think that's his way of inviting you to send tweets and things after the fact and give your unvarnished opinion of what we have here to share.

14
00:01:41,558 --> 00:01:46,404
So yeah, long and short of it is, as you're probably aware, he's quite

15
00:01:47,705 --> 00:02:06,076
consistently busy, principally as an actor, and some pre-existing work scheduled some things at the last minute that he desperately tried to move, but scheduling complexities being what they are, he was unable

16
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:28,435
to make it so I said okay well I'll tell you what let's jump on a zoom call and I'm basically going to say hey what do you think about this and then just record his answer and show you all that so he can still be quite present because this project is one where it's a musical and I am the kind of music director and composer slash co-composer depending on the section of it

17
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:48,239
and Troy became our kind of voice director and so he and I worked really really closely together for years on this thing and I really thought even though I'm assuming in fact show me by a show of hands who here is a composer primarily or exclusively

18
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:56,392
Okay, so as I suspected, it would be most of you, although I thought it was going to be a more overwhelming majority, so that's nice.

19
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:57,152
I like that.

20
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:04,097
Also, what that probably means to me is that a lot of you are sitting here going, he's not here, and you're looking and figuring out a way to...

21
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,222
I will not take it personally.

22
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:13,384
He's very dreamy, I get it.

23
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:23,011
Point being that because the GDC obviously here, the audio track and the world of game audio in general,

24
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:35,634
I think composers and sound designers get quite a lot of focus in what we do, but it's really quite an unsung hero in terms of how to work with and collaborate with voice actors and voice talent and that sort of thing.

25
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:44,216
And because a musical calls for such a strong overlap between your actors and the music, and for obvious reasons, the whole premise of pitching this talk together was that

26
00:03:45,296 --> 00:04:04,245
he could speak to the idea of directing and what a lot of his thoughts I thought translated so beautifully as almost a metaphor for the way composers can collaborate both with the musicians that we hire and work with and help bring our scores to life, but also the ways that we collaborate with the people that bring us on, you know, game directors and audio directors and people like that.

27
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:09,908
So a lot of what he says I think is actually quite universal even though it's specific to this.

28
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:13,550
So real quick, let me give some background

29
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,455
on what this thing is because, again, this hasn't come out yet.

30
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:21,958
So I'm going to hopefully not say too much that I'm just assuming you know what I'm talking about.

31
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:24,420
I'll remind myself, no one here has played this game.

32
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,821
No one has any clue what I'm talking about.

33
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:31,164
Of course, it's just general state that I have to contend with in my conversations with people.

34
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:44,173
So it's kind of a wonderful little GDC fairy tale because five years ago, GDC 2018, which as a side note, the idea that 2018 was five years ago, I'm still wrapping my brain around.

35
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:54,446
but pandemic created this weird time horizon that it's like, you know, interstellar with seven years passing for one and five seconds for the other.

36
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:59,429
I have a game developer friend who called me up and said,

37
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:08,625
When we meet at GDC in a few weeks, this would have been like February or something of 2018, he calls me and says, I want you to pitch me a game.

38
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:18,029
Instead of me design a game and then ask if you'd be willing to write the score, what if you threw an idea at me and we thought about making that game?

39
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:23,530
So I, of course, showed up to GDC with a list of, like, 46 game pitches.

40
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:32,013
And one of them was, you know what would be amazing is my big passion in game music is interactive music design.

41
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:39,035
I really, really love exploring ways for the music to not just simply accompany the gameplay, but to become an interwoven part of the gameplay.

42
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:44,856
So I said, imagine that, but the gameplay is, in some way or another, a musical.

43
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,397
And he goes, oh, wow, I hate that idea.

44
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:56,984
But weirdly, I have a friend who's looking for collaborators on the premise of making an interactive musical.

45
00:05:57,144 --> 00:06:01,466
And he's from Australia, and he's here at GDC for one more hour, and then he's going to fly home.

46
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,507
So I scramble to find this guy.

47
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:08,430
I literally sprint across the city in slow motion with rain.

48
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,351
And that was this time, actually.

49
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:18,956
meet up, the guy's name is Liam Essler and he was starting a company called Summerfall Studios with the idea being, what if we made a musical?

50
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:31,764
And the astonishing fairytaleness of it was that he was looking to set up this company in collaboration with David Gaider and Ellie Young without knowing who would write the music or anything.

51
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:38,649
You would think that they would have had that figured out before going to set up the company and quitting their prior jobs and things like that.

52
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:42,211
And so you'd be shit out of luck for someone in my position.

53
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,473
But somehow we met at the exact right moment.

54
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:45,053
It was amazing.

55
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:45,613
We hit it off.

56
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:49,116
We had this amazing hour before he then had to rush to the airport, fly home to Melbourne.

57
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,898
And so it was like, OK, let's do this.

58
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,860
So of course, the first question is, well, how is this going to manifest?

59
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,143
Because game mechanics are as numerous as stars in the sky.

60
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:03,826
So how do you define the way that music might interact with it?

61
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:20,304
The co-founder of this company, David Gaider, was the lead writer for quite a bit of the Dragon Age franchise and basically left BioWare in order to make this game and start this new independent company.

62
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:32,432
And so one of the ideas, the kind of joking pitch was, you know, what if we took the dialogue system of a game like Bioware and then got rid of all the other parts of Dragon Age and made that the game?

63
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:35,074
So it's very, very narrative and dialogue driven.

64
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:46,840
And because he had spent so many years developing these just absolute crazy labyrinthine branching dialogue systems with huge amounts of narrative implications and not just

65
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,266
what's behind door A, B, C, choose a line and then it funnels you right back.

66
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,929
But it's like the story actually evolves in a very branching kind of way.

67
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:59,197
We thought, okay, that's a great sort of jumping off point.

68
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,263
The game, Stray Gods, as it's now called, was originally called Chorus, and another game came out called Chorus.

69
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,845
So now we're called Stray Gods.

70
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,127
And it's actually a way better name.

71
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:14,469
I love this title.

72
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:18,531
The long and short of it, just to give a really quick synopsis on the story.

73
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:26,349
is this character that you see in the middle wearing the kind of black leather jacket is named Grace.

74
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:27,550
That's her player character.

75
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,532
And at the beginning, Grace essentially is accused of a murder.

76
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:34,233
She witnesses a murder.

77
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:36,675
She witnesses a death.

78
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:43,440
that's presumably caused by murder, and then she's told, you're the suspect.

79
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:57,231
And it turns out that the people accusing her are the remnants of the pantheon of Greek gods, who as it turns out are real and alive and kind of living in a shadowy existence in the modern world.

80
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:16,382
and one of the things that happens as part of the death of this character is she realizes that this character is the last of the muses, Calliope, and Calliope's sort of magical power is the ability to draw the truth out of people

81
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:18,106
through song.

82
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:22,647
And so she inadvertently, by mistake, it certainly absorbs this power.

83
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:30,128
And then the gods basically say to her, OK, so you have one week to prove your innocence or we will kill you.

84
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,949
So the game is sort of effectively a murder mystery.

85
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:35,789
And so it's like, OK, great.

86
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:36,229
Love it.

87
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,590
This was David's story pitch.

88
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,671
And so it was like, well, we need to start working out how this is going to go.

89
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,511
So we made some initial concepts

90
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,232
What we did is kind of create like a paint over.

91
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:54,215
This was just, let's create like a simulated UI, some really basic animations and just kind of see how it feels.

92
00:09:54,555 --> 00:10:07,640
So I wrote what is effectively a linear piece of music, this is all again several years ago, where I kind of predetermined the idea of a branch and we developed this sort of simple, you can see this sort of trait based

93
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,700
UI.

94
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:22,868
The classic Bioware model, of course, you think of Mass Effect or you think of Knights of the Old Republic where you've got, you know, your blue Jedi choice and your red Sith choice, or Renegade and Paragon, et cetera, et cetera, sort of good versus evil.

95
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:27,210
We wanted to instead lean into something that's a little bit more sort of subjective.

96
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,653
So our trait-based system, we kind of termed them the kick-ass, clever, and charming.

97
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:34,994
And the idea being that

98
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:44,508
because the songs tend to be about antagonistic encounters where you're trying to get information from somebody, you have different strategies with which to deal with them.

99
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:48,354
So you can be very in their face and very confrontational, which is the red one.

100
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,958
You can be very kind of empathic

101
00:10:51,558 --> 00:11:07,155
and sort of emotionally sensitive, where you're trying to very genuinely see their point of view, which is the green one, and then the blue one is the more kind of cerebral, intellectual, sometimes that manifests as maybe it's even conniving, you're trying to outsmart them, that kind of thing.

102
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:10,776
And so the idea is that there is no actual right or wrong choice.

103
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,037
This is not solving puzzles.

104
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:16,919
This is essentially the essence of what role-playing originally was conceived of.

105
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,821
You are taking this existing character and then saying, how would I approach this?

106
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:29,464
Because what's great about all these traits is that they're intrinsically emotional, which makes it excellent for writing songs off of them.

107
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:33,327
So we had our little team assembled.

108
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,648
We had the basic of our concept.

109
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,370
That's David and Ellie and Liam.

110
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,331
That's my girlfriend, Angela, who was enjoying sushi with us.

111
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:40,834
And then we brought on Troy.

112
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:45,398
And then we have the superhuman Laura Bailey as Grace.

113
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,462
And so it's kind of this dream team.

114
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:56,108
And so to that end, I had Troy say a few words about this idea of casting and auditions and that sort of thing.

115
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:03,411
As an actor, there's a little bit of, you know, insight that I think that I could have into the process.

116
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:05,214
My goal is always

117
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:10,126
in whatever capacity I'm working in, I just want to try to be a problem solver.

118
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:17,510
And how can I position myself to be on the right side of the table with the right people, looking at the right problem in the right way.

119
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,972
And a lot of that is, just as an actor, I hate auditioning.

120
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,673
It's not fun.

121
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,634
It's typically very uninformed.

122
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:30,276
It's not a delightful process for

123
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,540
either party.

124
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:42,447
So what I found to be very substantially beneficial is if you can just develop relationships with people and understand

125
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:53,044
who they are as an actor, who they are as a person, and how they're going to fit into this delicate ecosystem that you're creating.

126
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,746
That's a much smarter way to do it.

127
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:00,229
Why do the same people continue to get hired?

128
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:05,492
Because they consistently prove that they can solve the problems, consistently.

129
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:11,995
So one of the problems with auditioning, and I'm not saying that people shouldn't audition, I'm just saying there's an alternative to it.

130
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:23,700
Part of the problem with auditioning is you have no idea, as the director or the producer, how many takes it took for you to get that performance.

131
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,421
It could have been take 5, it could have been take 500, you don't know.

132
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:33,430
But what you got, oh my gosh, the performance that we got out of it is great.

133
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:41,515
I mean, obviously, we're going to change it because we didn't tell them this thing about the character that's incredibly informative because we just wrote it yesterday.

134
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:45,158
But I'm sure they'll be able to take that adjustment.

135
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:49,481
Then you get the person in there, and you say, hey, you're not sad.

136
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:50,121
You're angry.

137
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,943
Or by the way, you're not from this planet.

138
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:53,924
You're actually from this.

139
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,585
And oh, you actually, you didn't have a brother.

140
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:56,166
You had a sister.

141
00:13:56,906 --> 00:14:01,008
and you watch as the actor can't make that adjustment and now you're stuck with a problem.

142
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:11,071
So for me it's about find someone that regardless of what you throw at them they're going to be able to roll with those punches and deliver every time.

143
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,392
That's why you get Laura Bailey.

144
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:16,029
Laura can do that.

145
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,190
It doesn't matter what you throw at Laura.

146
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:24,333
It's just like she's just playing Fruit Ninja and she can just chop that up mid-stream.

147
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:35,317
For some people, the auditioning process can be very informative and you can learn about the character because someone comes in with a completely different idea and you're like, I never thought of it that way.

148
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:40,779
And some of the greatest casting choices ever have been because of people that do that.

149
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,620
They change the mind of the director

150
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:45,703
because of their performance.

151
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:50,725
If you can be that person, if you can be that director, if you can be that open, then by all means do that.

152
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,906
See as many people as you can.

153
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,607
Constantly iterate on your character.

154
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,289
You cast the character multiple times.

155
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,709
You cast them when you write it.

156
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,290
You cast them when you cast it.

157
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,331
You cast it when you shoot it.

158
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,172
There's just multiple iterations.

159
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:06,353
And this industry, as you guys know, is all about iteration and innovation.

160
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,642
But regardless of the medium, the challenge remains.

161
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:14,944
You have to cast this game, and you better cast well.

162
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:31,174
We had a unique challenge in the fact of our casting choices were so targeted, so specific, because of the character type, because of the genre, and because of the skill set that was required of our actors.

163
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:34,576
We need you to act, and we need you to sing.

164
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:44,284
And we also hope that you're pretty adept at being able to track multiple non-linear storylines across several months, if not years.

165
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,547
That presents an incredibly unique challenge.

166
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,675
Yeah, one of the recurring themes that I have here is that the cast we ended up with are just not of this world.

167
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,357
And everything you just said there

168
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:23,132
is not only true very much of this project, but I also, the reason why I put that clip for that long is I remember thinking this really seems to apply to, for example, the musicians that I hire on my scores, like, you know, Kristen Nagus is here, hopefully, especially the composers in the room should all be familiar with Kristen Nagus, woodwind player, oboist, who plays also every other instrument ever conceived.

169
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:25,014
this talk.

170
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:38,873
like all they care about is playing the oboe, but it's, it's, this is someone who thrives on, Oh, here's a new challenge.

171
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:39,954
Here's a new thing that we can do.

172
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:42,336
Tina Guo is someone I've worked with extensively.

173
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,017
Who's the same way.

174
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:44,478
Tom Straley is a guitarist.

175
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:55,047
And so I think that's one of those where, uh, finding someone that you can kind of go deep with as opposed to having a really broad Rolodex has, has always been my strategy as well.

176
00:16:55,127 --> 00:17:00,472
I like, I always admired, you know, recently John Williams and Steven Spielberg celebrated 50 years of collaborating.

177
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:07,793
since 1973, and I look at that and I say, that's a relationship that has gone for depth versus breadth.

178
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:25,540
And I admire that, and I think this notion of just being a problem solver, like for a prospective musician wanting to record for composers, for example, framing yourself as someone who can help solve their problems, as opposed to, oh, I can just play the notes on the page, is the point he was making about actors and one that I find very

179
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:45,898
uh... apropos and likewise if you find yourself pitching yourself as a composer to an audio director or what not the more it's I'm someone who's here to help you solve the problem and make this easier and it's not just oh I'm some genius who writes all the best notes is you know gonna yield better long-term in my opinion uh...

180
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:56,681
So yes, as I mentioned, Troy became our director, and because this is a project that has quite a lot of dialogue and a lot of singing, we ended up tag teaming.

181
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:58,363
I learned an insane amount.

182
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:05,070
One of the biggest things that I learned from him that he himself had had to learn from other directors that he had worked with over the years

183
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:12,433
was that it's really easy to overshare and give a lot of information that's just fundamentally unneeded.

184
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:23,917
I've gotten that from the podium from conducting orchestras a lot of times where I'll, you know, I'll be working on a cue and I'll stop and I'll turn to them and I'll say, here's the thing, this is a scene where

185
00:18:24,923 --> 00:18:34,267
You know, the main characters just found out that, you know, their family has all been frozen in carbonite and they may never see them again.

186
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:41,990
And it's going to be really, you know, it's going to be really difficult, but at the same time it inspires them to have this resolve to cope with it.

187
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,051
And so it's sort of simultaneously heartbreaking.

188
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:48,152
And ten minutes later the concertmasters say, so louder?

189
00:18:51,420 --> 00:19:05,552
took me about 40 times of that happening before I learned to just say, okay, let's do it again, this time a little louder, because it's just, you became convinced that they need all this information, that somehow the bow is going to be really informed by this mental image of the, and it's just not the case.

190
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:09,115
But my assumption was, yeah, but that's because musicians are abstract.

191
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:11,978
Get in the room with the actors, now that stuff really matters.

192
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,199
And Troy's like, no, it doesn't.

193
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:21,504
He had a quote he mentioned where he says, all they need to ever know is what's at stake and what does the camera need.

194
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:26,067
Like in the case of performance capture or actual on camera, you could think of it as what does the microphone need.

195
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:27,108
That's it.

196
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,129
I have a little glimpse here.

197
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,133
When we did our initial little prototyping, I was, here's a little moment.

198
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:50,861
Gonna get through this no matter the odds I'll solve a crime, I'll be divine I guess I'll give this a whirl Give yourself that.

199
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:51,762
Cool?

200
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:52,242
Yeah.

201
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:57,786
So we're going for, uh, I can't think like that.

202
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:58,847
Yeeth.

203
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,348
Section 11 is bar 40.

204
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:13,088
At which point he discovered, I'm not paying attention, I'm just fucking filming.

205
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:19,193
So we made a little prototype, here's just a little taste.

206
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:28,200
This is not, every single note was completely thrown away and started over again because this prototype was just proof of concept to try to get money for the game basically.

207
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,641
But here's a little taste we did with Laura.

208
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,825
Okay, so it all began when the band held auditions.

209
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,882
No, no, no, no, wait.

210
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:37,503
Singing.

211
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,385
I didn't... Fine.

212
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:44,427
Alright, I know.

213
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,409
This might be hard to believe.

214
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,751
I'm not drunk or possessed.

215
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:52,793
Okay, a little naive.

216
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:54,674
But this happened.

217
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:57,256
I swear it happened.

218
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:02,779
My life was normal until Calliope.

219
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:11,097
So there's a less part of a longer thing, but just to give you a little taste of kind of, you know, how it was sounding.

220
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,659
And then of course, pretty much right after we did that, the pandemic hit.

221
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:17,301
Um, so it was like, okay, well now we have to rethink our strategy.

222
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:25,605
In fact, the funny thing was that the team is principally based in Melbourne, Australia, and we're in LA for us to really kind of get rolling and do some initial recordings.

223
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:42,003
And, um, it, if you all remember those first few days it was kind of hard to gauge if this was a real problem, um, because it just didn't seem like it can't possibly get, it can't scale to like a global, it just, nah, that's like movie shit.

224
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:47,446
And so they had, they had flights to go back to Australia and it was one of those where every day got

225
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,106
you may want to consider moving this flight earlier.

226
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:59,669
You may never go home if you delay and sure enough at one point they did finally move their flights and then the next day all the borders closed and it was, it was kind of dodged a bullet.

227
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:06,150
Um, it was, it was quite a time to be starting something, uh, this sort of huge in, in scope.

228
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,252
Anyway, uh, we showed our little proof of concept around and, uh, you know, yeah, you got some money.

229
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,412
Now we got to actually write this shit.

230
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:22,899
So I fundamentally am not a lyricist, as evidenced by the poetry you see before you.

231
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:34,224
And so I knew that I wanted to bring in, now apropos Troy's comments earlier about finding people that really can consistently inspire you and that make you better and you hopefully make them better.

232
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,069
I have had the great fortune of working on this photo on the left.

233
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:41,511
That's a band from Australia called Tripod.

234
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:46,137
And they are genius songwriters.

235
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:55,787
And so I had worked with them on Assassin's Creed Syndicate and a bunch of other projects where we were kind of co-writing stuff and they were writing lyrics to music I was writing.

236
00:22:56,488 --> 00:23:17,893
and they're just they're amazing they're a comedy band go look them up on youtube they've been a band together for almost thirty years and just absolutely hilarious and brilliant and unlike most musical comedy where it's sort of very generic and bland music with witty lyrics they're actually really quite brilliant musicians so the songs are interesting and also hilarious and witty and interesting

237
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:21,816
I said, I want to bring these guys in.

238
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:25,337
And obviously, it helped that they live in the same city as the game's studio.

239
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:30,139
That sort of somehow made things easier for, I don't know why that matters, but it was nice.

240
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:39,843
And then the funny thing was, we started to look at the list of what we needed and realized, there's a lot of material here.

241
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:43,324
Because originally, it was going to be, OK, the four of us together will write each song.

242
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:46,405
And then it was, OK, so that's going to take about 46 years.

243
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:52,749
because you'll see, I'll get to it in a minute, but the complexity started to really exponentially go nuts.

244
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:58,813
So then it was, okay, then I'm going to work individually with each of them on multiple songs at once.

245
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,535
So the guy on the left is Scott.

246
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:02,935
Scott and I will work on a song.

247
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:05,617
The guy with the cap on is Jan.

248
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,598
Jan and I will work on a song.

249
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:07,919
Gatesy and I will work on a song as a third guy.

250
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,522
And even with that, it was like, this is still going to be pretty hard to finish in a reasonable amount of time.

251
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,583
There's just so much music that we're looking at.

252
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:18,266
And so Liam, the co-founder of the company and our studio director,

253
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:25,909
He just sent me a list of, he's like, here's some other sort of songwriters and weird, interesting indie musicians and stuff who I like, and it could be cool.

254
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,589
And one of them was this woman, Montaigne.

255
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:33,291
And I was listening, and it was like this really kind of quirky pop music that I thought was really well done.

256
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:34,852
She's got incredible vocal chops.

257
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:39,674
and we were saying, oh yeah, that should be cool, we should maybe track down her manager or something and reach out.

258
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:47,357
And then before we could do that, she cold calls us because she heard about the game and was just like, hey, I'm a nerdy gamer, this sounds awesome, do you need any help?

259
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:51,359
And it was like, holy shit, that's amazing.

260
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:52,820
Welcome aboard.

261
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,722
And then the hilarious thing was then we get started.

262
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:56,543
Of course, the pandemic was off and rolling.

263
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,826
And then she was like, oh, by the way, I got to go.

264
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,728
I got a gig I got to go do.

265
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:05,051
But I'll be back and we'll keep writing again in like a month or whatever.

266
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:08,074
Turns out she was Australia's Eurovision contestant.

267
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:12,598
So she had to go kind of do that for a minute and then come back.

268
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,722
She very generously returned to the land of normal people to help us on our game.

269
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:23,209
So one thing I want to explain about this is that I don't actually think of this as non-linear.

270
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:32,317
I started referring to it as multi-linear because it is, it's a branching narrative but it's not, it's not open ended in the way like an open world game or something that's

271
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,620
procedurally generated might be.

272
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:41,487
It's more just that there is a completely stupid amount of possibilities that we are arming the player with.

273
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:46,072
So that you have an enormous amount of agency, but it is fundamentally all bespoke content.

274
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:51,278
And so it's not linear, but non-linear didn't feel like the correct word.

275
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:51,839
And so

276
00:25:52,620 --> 00:26:02,016
As part of the discovery of the distinction between those, I laid out a few rules for myself and also in talking to the team because the music had such an opportunity to inform the narrative.

277
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:05,802
It wasn't just that David wrote a story and said, okay, here's, you know,

278
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:07,133
situation

279
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:29,225
genius with keeping track of all the branches in his head.

280
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:30,345
I will never understand it.

281
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:45,589
Oh, well, if we change this, what that means is, like, there's 42 scenes later, there's this A, B choice, and if we change what you're talking, then the B is going to have to change, which I guess is fine, because there's this other scene, and then you just, like, work it out from memory in front of us over and over and over.

282
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:48,070
And I always go, is this written down anywhere?

283
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,412
Like, if you slip into a coma, are we just completely fucked?

284
00:26:52,592 --> 00:26:54,913
And I think the answer to that might have been yes for quite a bit of the project.

285
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:57,715
But I didn't ask too much for the sake of my sanity.

286
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,696
So here were some of the rules that were laid out.

287
00:26:59,736 --> 00:27:01,797
First off, the songs have to have narrative consequence.

288
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:14,503
This seems obvious, but it's really easy when you go into the normal rhythms of game design to just kind of, as the writer, as the creative director, to start laying down foundational points and just know, OK, there's going to be music that fills in the gaps.

289
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:25,530
in between, but it was like, no, no, no, no, the whole point of a musical is that if the narrative reaches a certain emotional threshold before words no longer count, it must be sung in order to really get the meaning across.

290
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,952
That means that that's when the actual important stuff is happening.

291
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:39,720
So we need to make sure that all those linchpin moments in your story where it seems like, you know, this is going to really make a difference to how the story turns out and who the character ends up being, blah, blah, blah, that needs to happen in song.

292
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:46,160
And in addition to the fact that these choices need to be something that the player is making, we're not feeding them.

293
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,540
These are not cutscenes.

294
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,081
The songs are the main gameplay.

295
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:56,464
It's not just that you're making a succession of choices in this kind of like concatenated series of one-offs.

296
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,605
The idea is that these choices have to compound.

297
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:04,587
So think of it as I have door A, B, and C, like I showed you the three colored traits.

298
00:28:04,647 --> 00:28:05,568
I have door A, B, and C.

299
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:17,853
It's not that behind that is door D, E, and F. It's that behind A is D, E, and F. Behind B would be G, H, and I. And I'm very quickly going to lose the ability to keep this going.

300
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:19,734
But you get the idea.

301
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:24,576
It's each decision impacts the decisions that come after it.

302
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,697
And so it has a ripple effect.

303
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:28,137
It's like life in that way.

304
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:33,820
I can't just randomly walk back everything I do as much as we all wish we could do that on a regular basis.

305
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,381
And so the compounding of the choices was a crucial one.

306
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:46,862
And the last one, which again sounds very kind of pointless to assert, is that they have to sound like real songs.

307
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:57,664
But what I mean by that is that it's really easy to get lost in the weeds and say, OK, well, the character is going to sing this to whoever, like Grace is singing to X.

308
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:09,426
And so then X replies with this and then Grace can then sing with this and this and very quickly it's almost like you're writing dialogue and just setting it to melody and it's not a song.

309
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:25,292
Songs, even structurally avant-garde ones, typically will have some form of perceptible structure that is what makes us register it as a song and not just as a through composed, you know, an art song as we would call it in the classical world or something like that.

310
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:26,673
Although those also tend to have

311
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:27,914
perceptual structure.

312
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,516
So it's a terrible example and I'm a fraud.

313
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:32,417
But you get what I'm saying.

314
00:29:32,477 --> 00:29:37,221
The most banal way to phrase it is verse chorus, pre-chorus, chorus returns.

315
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:45,847
These structural elements that we're all deeply familiar with as composers and songwriters need to be able to come back.

316
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:54,633
But you can imagine that if this is something that is crazy branching, how to also shoehorn it into that kind of structure became fundamentally our challenge.

317
00:29:55,114 --> 00:29:56,075
So here's an example

318
00:29:56,815 --> 00:29:59,437
This is like maybe the simplest song in the game.

319
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:04,481
It's really, really basic, but just to give a sense of kind of how some of the diagramming works.

320
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:08,604
And this one even, this is almost an incidental sort of transitional moment.

321
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:13,567
This isn't even like one of the full-on songs, but it gives you a little sense of, of

322
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:33,721
the way that things kind of, there's paths that are also different lengths, where sometimes you arrive at an ending, like if you go here, you know, 1 to 2 to 3A, 4 to 5, actually 1, 2, 3C, and 5 is actually quite short compared to some of the other possibilities, you know, 1, 2, 3A, 6, 7.

323
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:36,503
That's just a fundamentally longer song.

324
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:42,367
So it's interesting, because then different choices actually yield really different musical results, even just in terms of their length.

325
00:30:44,028 --> 00:31:01,448
Some of the other kinds of interactivity that we had is some choices that you might make in a song determines which songs will even then populate the game after that, so that some of the interactivity is happening in this downstream way where, you know, you have three different characters that you're kind of interacting with and you choose one.

326
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:02,730
The two that you didn't

327
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:09,233
choose may have had their own musical numbers that are now completely removed from the game for this particular playthrough.

328
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:23,364
So I wanted there to be kind of, in other words, short and medium and long term interactive musical concepts at work so that the actual set list, as it were, was evolving as much as the actual songs in real time are.

329
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:37,315
And we do some things, for example, where the system is actually also measuring how many of a certain type of choice that you've made, and then will funnel you into a choice based on the average.

330
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,477
Like, OK, you chose red more often than the others.

331
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:43,520
So what you don't realize is the next thing you're hearing is part of the interactive system.

332
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,401
This isn't just through-line cinematic.

333
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,062
But you didn't choose it right now.

334
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:51,706
You chose it over the last five minutes based on the things that you've been doing in aggregate.

335
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:54,694
so that there's again this compounding that can occur.

336
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:59,087
So you end up sometimes with a really simple one like this and then sometimes they look more like this.

337
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:16,181
But you can kind of see from the label along the right, the way we tried to force it to have sort of the essence of what an actual sort of song's structure might look like.

338
00:32:16,682 --> 00:32:19,103
It took, by the way, about two years to write all of these.

339
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:22,365
It was well over five hours worth of material.

340
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:23,826
And we ran an algorithm

341
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:28,848
in Unreal, and it turns out that there's like many tens of thousands of permutations.

342
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:33,371
So no one will ever actually play the game every possible way in the one lifetime.

343
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:35,472
I don't think that's even physically possible.

344
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:39,153
And that's the meaningful differences.

345
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:41,815
There's some differences where it's like, OK, well, you chose this, we chose that.

346
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:45,237
You'll get similar music, but the orchestration is slightly different between them.

347
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,137
I don't even count that.

348
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:48,438
That's too superficial to even include in the list.

349
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,060
If you include those, it's like hundreds of millions of permutations.

350
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,721
It's absolutely stupid.

351
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:55,802
Don't advise this.

352
00:32:55,862 --> 00:32:59,225
This is basically a talk for me trying to steer you all into better choices in your life.

353
00:33:02,787 --> 00:33:14,956
But you can see the color trait organization and you can see some of the concepts I was talking about where the player reaches these nodes, they make a choice, it will feed them, it will then feed you different choices based on the choices that you made before.

354
00:33:15,277 --> 00:33:22,262
So that very often, like for example, you can see on the line labeled Chorus 2, where for the player, they think they are making

355
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:34,405
a choice of three, they have three options, they have a triumvirate before them and, but in reality there's actually nine because the system is going yeah but what did you do before?

356
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:43,387
So if you're like under this blue banner then you have red, green and blue under the nest of blue and if you had chosen red then you have red, green and blue under the nest of red.

357
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:44,127
All this has

358
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:51,229
wild musical implications, it sometimes means whole different genres of music within a song, and you're kind of swimming back and forth and changing.

359
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:57,672
And the idea is that all of this has to sound like a real song, and hopefully a good one, if we're lucky.

360
00:33:59,213 --> 00:34:03,194
So, like I said, it took about two years, so yay, now we have all the songs, we gotta record this shit.

361
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:06,475
Turns out that's a whole thing as well.

362
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:13,238
So I had a quick thing here from Troy about onboarding our cast into this.

363
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:23,296
that actor walks in and it's this dance and the thing that I found is that you have about five minutes to

364
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,424
let them know who's in control, who's in charge.

365
00:34:29,324 --> 00:34:42,968
Because if the director and the writer are not locked up, if there's any dissonance there, it's not that, well, the writer's going to have control, that's who I listen to, or the director's going to have control.

366
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:46,529
The actor will take control, because they don't trust either of you now.

367
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:51,971
Because there's not this harmony between a single voice that's speaking to them and saying the same thing.

368
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:59,126
So you have to walk in and go, we're here to tell you this story and show you how you fit into it.

369
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,809
And we're curious to see what you can bring to it.

370
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:12,297
So now you realize, what I'm trying to set up is that it's the three of us working together as opposed to we've given you a script, you give us lines, and we've got four hours to get out of here.

371
00:35:13,732 --> 00:35:28,057
Yeah, I think another way to phrase that is the only possible way to get through it all was to really make sure to invite the cast to feel like real contributors, because we booked nearly a hundred sessions with the actors.

372
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:30,258
I mean, it was six months of recording.

373
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:33,119
And so, especially in the case of someone like Laura,

374
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:41,450
you got to spend a lot of time together, which means that you need her and everyone else to feel very bought in, that they really have a voice in this.

375
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,812
So one of the choices that I made was we wrote all the songs.

376
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:47,212
In fact, let me just jump to this.

377
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:52,534
I'm going to, in the interest of time, I think this is a little long.

378
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:58,225
I got plenty from Troy here.

379
00:35:59,705 --> 00:36:03,286
Well, I'll save the point I was going to make when I play you audio in just a second.

380
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:07,527
An easy trap to fall into is, well, just hold their hands through it.

381
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,788
And that sounds like a lovely sentiment, and that sounds like a very supportive thing.

382
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:22,730
The problem with it is, the second that the actor becomes aware of the fact that you're holding their hand, the instant thing that that telegraphs is, yes, you're supporting them, but also you don't fully trust them.

383
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:29,135
And this process really required that we just let it go.

384
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:40,461
And we had done everything that we could on our side to write, to create a world that felt real and tangible even though it's very fantastical.

385
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:45,544
but also to cast these people and go, we know that you can do this.

386
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:46,545
We believe in you.

387
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:47,906
That's why you're in that booth.

388
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:49,527
So show us what you can do.

389
00:36:50,127 --> 00:37:04,618
And if they feel our hand on their back the entire time, it can actually kind of be very counterproductive to letting them feel comfortable enough to do something that's really, really awkward, which is to sing.

390
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:07,721
It's one thing for an actor to come in and go, I've got this.

391
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,562
Now, when you're dealing with people like,

392
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:15,974
Yes, you know that you're dealing with f***ing talent and these guys knew exactly how to do it.

393
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:19,976
You're dealing with people who haven't necessarily been in this situation before.

394
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:24,197
You need to let them feel that they can do hard things and that they are up to the task.

395
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:25,897
So a lot of times we have to do this.

396
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:40,602
The problem is, if you're not holding their hand, if you're not over-communicating, there's a lot of information that we are having to communicate to our actors in order for them to understand where they're at in the scene, because it's not a very traditional way of doing this.

397
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,316
Most actors want to come in and go, okay, so where are we right now?

398
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,317
What has just happened?

399
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:47,238
What do I want?

400
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:51,741
All the basic questions that actors have been taught to ask either you or themselves.

401
00:37:52,882 --> 00:38:02,190
The problem with our game is go, well, if the player has, and making sure that you could have already done this, but if you didn't, so now there's this

402
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:13,077
box of disconnected ideas that will come together as a very cohesive story, but in an actor's mind, they've got nothing to hold onto.

403
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:19,062
So what becomes very critical is that we concisely communicate information.

404
00:38:21,297 --> 00:38:22,078
Yeah, it's always the same.

405
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:23,059
Just don't overshare.

406
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,681
And just try to boil it down.

407
00:38:26,942 --> 00:38:28,444
It's part of the writing process as well.

408
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:34,730
There'd be so many times you get so lost in the weeds over a single line and then just realize, you know, this is going to go by like that.

409
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,652
Or maybe they'll never even hear it because they chose some other path.

410
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:43,278
And it's really easy to kind of shoot yourself in the foot with that.

411
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:45,460
In the interest of time, he kind of

412
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:51,096
talks here about basically you don't need to do a billion takes.

413
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,277
If it's not working, move on.

414
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:58,901
But I want to not run out of time here, and I also prefer to have a Q&A and have discussion.

415
00:38:58,921 --> 00:38:59,541
It's way more fun.

416
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:09,127
But the point I was going to make a moment ago that sort of leaps off of his notion about giving them space was

417
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:25,963
we made the decision early on to approach this kind of like we were workshopping a broadway musical and so when writing the songs we would create essentially like rehearsal piano tracks or in some cases like the tripod guys they were recording the vocalist because

418
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,185
you can probably guess by the way I talk, I can't sing for shit.

419
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:33,626
And so I was like, let's make some scratch vocals with the real singers.

420
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:38,847
And they would find it easier to record to some rudimentary drum beat or something.

421
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:46,729
And so they would literally just take like a garage band, you know, Fruity Loops or something and just create something very generic just so that it helps them to sing.

422
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:53,931
And so the most elaborate that we would have in terms of these initial backing tracks were just, you know, simple piano chords

423
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:58,513
and then the maybe a drum, maybe a simple bass line.

424
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:22,864
The idea being that when we get in there with the actor, they actually really have a lot of say and, you know, not just sliding it up and down and re-pitching it in Pro Tools live in the studio with them in order to accommodate the strengths of their voice, but also to let that be part of the storytelling where, you know, Laura might say, you know, this is right in a range where I can sing it down here in the lower part of my voice and it has a very kind of grumbly quality

425
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:27,828
But if I sang it up an octave, much more of a head voice, it would take on this kind of quality.

426
00:40:27,888 --> 00:40:30,629
And I think reading through the lyrics, it actually makes sense to have it up there.

427
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:34,951
But in bar seven, it's a little beyond what I can reach.

428
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:36,953
So can we, like, pull the whole thing down?

429
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,434
And so we would, like, say, yes, yes, love it.

430
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:46,878
The fact that you are discovering ways to kind of bring your own ideas into this and breathe life into it is amazing.

431
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:47,799
And it makes it...

432
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,723
so much more of a viable finished product because it's the product of all of our ideas and intuitions.

433
00:40:54,783 --> 00:41:03,549
It's not just, you know, I wrote a thing, now please don't deviate, read my genius notes, and God help you if you change anything.

434
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:04,549
I'm not like that at all.

435
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:10,973
And again, part of the reason why I wanted to focus so much on this aspect of working with the performers is I think this can hold true for every musician collaboration we have.

436
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:15,216
I have it all the time with, you know, like I mentioned, the guitarist I love working with, Tom Straley.

437
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:23,498
He'll say things like, oh, I'm playing this part on a 12-string and I see what you wrote here and if I drop this note, that note, and that note, I can think of this way more organically.

438
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:27,259
And as a non-guitarist, I would say, I care about what sounds the best.

439
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:28,579
Here's the emotion I'm after.

440
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,599
Here's why I wrote those notes.

441
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:31,040
And he'd say, ah, what if we did this?

442
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,340
Or here's actually a different instrument that might achieve that better.

443
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,961
What do you think of this?

444
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:35,981
And my attitude is always,

445
00:41:36,781 --> 00:41:40,524
the player, the listener, will never know about this conversation.

446
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:41,745
They only know how it makes them feel.

447
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:45,968
And so the thing that creates that feeling, I do not care how we get there.

448
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:47,770
Whatever gets us there.

449
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,572
So I will skip this.

450
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,353
So we can listen to this shit.

451
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:56,617
So here are some initial little sketches.

452
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:02,962
This is where I'm going to end up fighting PowerPoint slightly because it's very janky.

453
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:08,124
So this was, I would send this to Tripod.

454
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:13,465
Oh my God, it's going to get very loud.

455
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:16,886
It might be worth, Ru, if you could pull it down just a little bit.

456
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:18,146
That's fine.

457
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,006
That might be too much.

458
00:42:21,927 --> 00:42:31,369
So we would do these Zoom calls to write these songs together, and I would often be kind of working stuff out on the piano, and then I would just record it and send it to them and say, you know, what do you think of this?

459
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:32,009
What do you think of that?

460
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:40,970
So here's one of those little sketches of, this is that song that I showed you with the crazy colorful branching a moment ago.

461
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:45,334
That was, this was some of the earliest ideas that I sent them for that.

462
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,317
So you can see it has a little bit of a kind of a sultry quality.

463
00:42:49,377 --> 00:42:51,498
It's a little bit sort of swaying.

464
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:55,902
So there's one little taste.

465
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:58,163
So here was like, okay, let's refine it a little.

466
00:42:58,504 --> 00:43:02,667
And then about halfway through this, there's a little fragment of a melody.

467
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:08,379
So you're keeping your guard up That'll help once you're out in the fray Lots of folks out to get you

468
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:38,264
They were very fancy with their panning to represent two characters in the scene.

469
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:42,146
So then it's like, okay, let's keep messing with that.

470
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:51,014
So you get the idea, sort of playing with it.

471
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:55,536
The idea is Grace is being taught about her superpower.

472
00:43:56,156 --> 00:43:58,757
Freddie is her best friend.

473
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,239
So you know, kind of playing around with the idea.

474
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,040
So then it was like, okay, well what if

475
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:20,544
What if, you know, that becomes a recurring hook and that each player choice sort of presents you with something new in front of it.

476
00:44:20,944 --> 00:44:23,005
Maybe that's how we make it feel like a song.

477
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,025
Can we start over?

478
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,605
Hi, my name is Grace.

479
00:44:26,826 --> 00:44:29,426
This is Freddy and we're in a band.

480
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:30,787
What should we call you?

481
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:34,367
How about old-timey weirdo who's up in our face?

482
00:44:37,596 --> 00:44:38,217
together.

483
00:44:38,277 --> 00:44:41,679
Forgive me, this is going to sound horrible because I'm going to tab through all of those speakers.

484
00:44:57,728 --> 00:45:00,310
It's fucking weird primitive PowerPoint.

485
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,454
So then let me show you some of the actual final mixes on how we end up with this.

486
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:12,639
So then we, you know, these little speakers correspond to where they are positioned on here.

487
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,040
So I'm not going to play all of it for you.

488
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:25,268
Like I said, some of these songs, to play the full song in every incarnation would literally take several hours because even just the raw guts of the way that these things can be added up is

489
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:29,215
Our average was about five or six to one.

490
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:40,924
So if it's a five minute song, there's 35, 40 minutes worth of material that is potentially being pulled from, which is how you end up with like five hours worth of musical numbers.

491
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:43,025
Please kill me.

492
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:52,292
So here's an example of how it starts off, where we introduce our little verse tune that I just played with you.

493
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:59,900
Grace, you know that you're lost now.

494
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:05,422
You've been given powers you don't understand.

495
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:09,404
I'm the guy who can help you.

496
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:15,167
All that you hear is at your command.

497
00:46:15,347 --> 00:46:15,827
Wait.

498
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:16,888
No, it's okay, Freddy.

499
00:46:18,088 --> 00:46:19,649
This is all me?

500
00:46:21,173 --> 00:46:21,213
in

501
00:46:37,668 --> 00:46:43,430
makes different choices and then we often again each song is structured a little differently depending on its role within the narrative.

502
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:54,433
The idea was to make sure that we have simultaneously downstream effects that you will carry with you but always there needs to be something that the player immediately registers as feedback to the choice that they made.

503
00:46:54,933 --> 00:47:09,160
And so the way that I personally chose to address that is by saying that each trait choice will always have a very noticeable instrument in the mix that is only associated with that trait choice, so that you develop a kind of Pavlovian association between that color and that sound.

504
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,882
So the three that I chose is that the red, you will always hear a prominent

505
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:18,916
semi-distorted electric bass and the kind of supportive, you know, bass role.

506
00:47:20,097 --> 00:47:28,279
The green, the empathic, I chose a harp, which often is very kind of ethereally treated as well.

507
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:29,539
It's not just straightforward.

508
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:33,400
And what I like about that is that those have a different role from one another.

509
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,821
They're both inherently accompanimental

510
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:43,591
instruments but they have very different ways that they can be accompanimental, obviously harp having a massive range.

511
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:51,401
And then the blue, the clever, I chose, I alternate back and forth between B flat and then bass clarinet, often in a very kind of

512
00:47:52,375 --> 00:48:16,809
you know like borderline Dixieland kind of play style which is fun because that's a melodic instrument and so it's now about counter melody so that you you feel this twist even though it won't change necessarily in that exact moment what the verse and the chorus are it that's an aggregating a compounding change you'll feel the instrumentation shift instantly once you make make those choices that you never feel like

513
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:20,830
You're making a choice, but you don't really feel that you did something.

514
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:30,475
David Gaider, our creative director and the writer, had this brilliant catchphrase where he says, if the player clicks on a thing and they can't perceive what they did, he calls that doing card tricks in the dark.

515
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:37,658
And I always thought that was genius, because it's like, it is just not a good game design strategy.

516
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:41,259
So, we introduce our little birds.

517
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:45,000
You know, he obviously hinted at it in a very sort of quasi-spoken way.

518
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,021
And then we get our first little taste of it in that very first choice.

519
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:54,522
Not about to just trust you.

520
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,743
You barge in and take over the place.

521
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:01,924
I don't know what I must do, but here's what you can do.

522
00:49:02,164 --> 00:49:03,624
Get out of my face!

523
00:49:03,684 --> 00:49:04,664
I'm doing it right now.

524
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:06,725
You're a natural, girl.

525
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:09,137
You can also hear a fair bit of vocal production on her.

526
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:12,079
That's something that is consistently associated with the Red choice.

527
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:13,900
The idea is that it's a lot drier.

528
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:14,761
It's a lot punchier.

529
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:23,327
There's often kind of delays and saturation effects and things like a pop song in order so that Red, her voice sounds different when you click that choice throughout the game.

530
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:34,274
Every song, no matter the genre, no matter if it's a sweet and sentimental song or it's a big, you know, showstoppery kind of over the top one, whatever it is, there needs to be these consistent things that somehow have to be made to work.

531
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:45,783
In the case of the blue, for example, that tends to be a very kind of middle-of-the-road treatment with little occasional effects and things placed on her voice.

532
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:50,867
And then the green tends to be really lush reverb and really spacious.

533
00:49:52,228 --> 00:49:56,432
And there's also orchestrational implications, you know, the red tends to be more percussive in nature.

534
00:49:57,392 --> 00:49:58,133
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

535
00:49:58,193 --> 00:50:01,634
So if the player had, instead of choosing red, they chose this one.

536
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:03,916
How the hell did you find me?

537
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,236
Here's our little clarinet.

538
00:50:05,256 --> 00:50:07,317
This is the weirdest night I've ever had.

539
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:09,739
And you say I have powers?

540
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:13,320
How could this possibly turn out bad?

541
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,201
Am I doing it now?

542
00:50:14,241 --> 00:50:14,961
Brilliant.

543
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:18,163
So it's like a parallel reality version of the same phrase.

544
00:50:18,803 --> 00:50:23,806
And then finally, our green choice.

545
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:25,619
Featuring The Harp.

546
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:47,364
So it's like, this is just, so obviously this one's very simple, because one of the ideas I also said to them is, I don't want it to just be, it's the same melody, but it's different lyrics each time.

547
00:50:47,384 --> 00:50:49,005
That's the really obvious way to do this.

548
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:56,128
But because this is the first major song of the game where we're teaching the player to kind of clock what we're doing, we start off with it doing that.

549
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:02,552
Then the player reaches the next hub, and now they actually fully define what the hook of the song is going to be.

550
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,291
So you choose red.

551
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:20,203
And actually I'll, let me just say narratively, this scene, she's been accused by the gods of a murder and then sent back home.

552
00:51:20,323 --> 00:51:21,123
And they're like, okay, good luck.

553
00:51:21,264 --> 00:51:21,704
See you in a week.

554
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:22,244
Good luck.

555
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:23,165
You know, you can do it.

556
00:51:23,946 --> 00:51:26,508
Hoping of course that she can't and that they get to execute her.

557
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:34,631
and in strides this character who basically is clearly one of the gods and is saying, you know, I can help you.

558
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,151
And the player has to choose, do I trust this guy?

559
00:51:37,451 --> 00:51:41,072
He seems kind of shady, but he is actually one of the gods.

560
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,613
So, I mean, he certainly knows more than I do.

561
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:45,854
Is this a bargain I'm willing to kind of go with?

562
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:47,554
And of course, as you can imagine, you

563
00:51:47,754 --> 00:51:53,080
you work out pros and cons as the song, and this is going to have ripple effects through the whole game.

564
00:51:54,221 --> 00:52:08,375
And so the scene, and you're with your character's best friend, Freddy, and so the song kind of becomes this tug of war where the red choice is about like, both of you need to give me some space because

565
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:10,317
I just have to work this out.

566
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:18,804
Clearly, I don't think I can trust you and, you know, Freddie, I love you, but you can't empathize with the position I'm in fully, so I should probably just work this out on my own.

567
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:26,350
Whereas the blue choice is, you know, this guy, you know, he knows stuff that I don't know.

568
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:31,975
I should probably trust him, even if it feels a little funny, and I'm sorry to my best friend and loyal confidant.

569
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:42,141
And then the green choice is the, you know, sorry, you are shady as fuck, and I'm going to stick with my friend, you know, my ride or die, as it were.

570
00:52:42,822 --> 00:52:47,585
And so you'll hear that reflected in these hooks, like this one, the red one, ends up being this is my time.

571
00:52:48,072 --> 00:52:55,402
time to shine and this becomes the hook of the song that influences everything so that no matter what you choose from that point forward we're playing around with this hook

572
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:20,572
This was a drink I'd be drinking But someone is dead and I'm losing my head Like the goat said This is my time Time to shine This is my time Time to shine

573
00:53:22,754 --> 00:53:26,257
She's getting a lot of pushback, of course.

574
00:53:26,377 --> 00:53:29,039
In contrast, here is the green, the blue.

575
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:51,737
So this morning fades into the day.

576
00:53:51,777 --> 00:53:53,378
He's telling you, you don't have time to sit on this.

577
00:53:53,418 --> 00:53:53,758
Trust me.

578
00:54:02,229 --> 00:54:11,732
And that comes back again in the interest of time I'm just going to power along here So here's where she's saying him, you are shady

579
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:43,544
So you get the idea.

580
00:54:43,604 --> 00:54:52,008
So then what happens from that point forward is basically the song is going to kind of arrange itself in front of you almost like, you know, Iceman in the X-Men where

581
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:59,332
It's going to look at the decisions that you've made and start feeding you new decisions under the banner of the decisions that you've made.

582
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:02,313
So here's an example of how this can manifest later on in the song.

583
00:55:04,074 --> 00:55:06,975
Grace, I'm worried that this guy has got to you.

584
00:55:06,995 --> 00:55:08,596
This is obviously one of the blue choices.

585
00:55:08,616 --> 00:55:08,896
What?

586
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:15,618
There's so much easier to explain, but all I want is to sing it again.

587
00:55:15,658 --> 00:55:19,420
It's my time, time to shine.

588
00:55:21,144 --> 00:55:26,809
So like, we initially heard that under the red banner, but now I'm choosing it under the green.

589
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:31,313
That's why you're hearing this clarinet with it, but that's our hook, so we're sticking with it.

590
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,814
Does that make sense?

591
00:55:32,854 --> 00:55:34,896
You end up with these cross pollinations of the material.

592
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:45,831
It's gone and the day wastes away Grace, this is our place Is he gonna stay?

593
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:57,715
See, I don't think I have any choice I know where you belong Grace, the song grates But can you show me the way?

594
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,596
It's time to play So

595
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:26,938
So you get so you know, there's the taste of that and then finally here's the last So all three that I've just played Which means the player just clicked green but you can hear all three of the hooks are passing through this filter because

596
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,273
earlier this year.

597
00:56:43,103 --> 00:56:46,545
For most of the development, green was blue and blue was green and yeah, I'm hopeless.

598
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:50,407
So anyway, point being, does that make sense what I'm describing?

599
00:56:50,427 --> 00:56:54,850
I know I'm being a little bit succinct here because I'm running out of time and I didn't want to get caught off.

600
00:56:54,870 --> 00:57:01,674
But that agency means that, you know, you end up making a choice and then everything is sort of going to compound on top of that.

601
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:03,375
Forgive me once again.

602
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:12,709
So yeah, hopefully, maybe it's not shit.

603
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:25,319
And I just wanted to really quickly address some of the challenges and possibly even failures of this, because part of the goal here in taking on this project is we said, well, what's something that feels like no one's ever really tried before?

604
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:29,843
And as Troy very succinctly put it, usually there's a reason.

605
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:33,565
And it turns out that this thing is quite a lift.

606
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:35,227
It's very expensive.

607
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:37,188
to

608
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:57,865
ratio of music that's recorded that a player will hear on any given playthrough, which is obscene.

609
00:57:58,705 --> 00:58:03,188
And which also means that there's huge amounts of content that maybe you'll never, ever, ever hear.

610
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:06,989
Also, don't even get me started about how in God's name I'm going to do a soundtrack album for this.

611
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:10,671
But that's a whole other talk, I think.

612
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:17,514
And Troy, just basically, I'll summarize this because I want to take a couple questions before we get chased out of here.

613
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:38,404
But he basically was talking about, as well, given the number of people, the number of actors, this constant, he felt he had to relearn over and over this idea that this really, this needs to be our thing and if I come in prepared to direct it with a specific goal in mind and the actor brings something totally unexpected to the table,

614
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:45,353
to just say, you know what, actually you're right, let's go with that and to really lean into that because the end product is likely to be better.

615
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:49,718
So, anyway, enough of quote our shit.

616
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,041
You can wishlist the game on Steam now.

617
00:58:53,102 --> 00:58:57,908
And yes, let's just get chased out of the room answering questions.

618
00:58:58,971 --> 00:58:59,431
Go for it!

619
00:58:59,691 --> 00:59:02,092
Yeah, as an actor and singer, this seems like a dream project.

620
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:09,073
I was already thinking in terms of those YouTubers that love to post cutscenes and how that's going to make their life absolutely miserable.

621
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:18,675
Is there going to be a feature in this game which will allow players to have their version of the song just so they can listen back to it because they might really like what they come up with?

622
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:19,875
Yeah, I think that's OBS.

623
00:59:22,236 --> 00:59:22,516
Okay.

624
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:23,756
about

625
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:41,254
And that has not been met very well.

626
00:59:41,294 --> 00:59:49,539
But no, so yeah, it's one of those where I have plans to release kind of like a barrage of albums that hopefully cover the bases as much as possible.

627
00:59:49,939 --> 00:59:55,982
And then it is going to just end up being a, you know, you just kind of have to play the game to, you know, experience it different ways.

628
00:59:56,062 --> 00:59:57,343
Which was, that was always the goal though.

629
00:59:58,806 --> 01:00:02,490
And was there any specific visual novels or musicals that really inspired you guys in the process of that?

630
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:21,067
Oh, I mean, I'm a Sondheim junkie, you know, to me, to me, sort of like the king.

631
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:42,376
I'm also a big obsessor for Leonard Bernstein, but, but so, you know, Sunday in the Park with George and Sweeney Todd and actually, but funny enough, you know what, the number one thing that we talked about at the beginning was the Buffy musical, because first off, it's pretty genius, but also it's baked into the fabric of that musical that they know they're in a musical and they have to escape it to survive.

632
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:43,177
And that was kind of,

633
01:00:43,957 --> 01:00:46,202
I thought that's an interesting kind of premise of sorts.

634
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,224
Let's sort of play with that.

635
01:00:47,725 --> 01:00:49,168
The characters know they're in a song.

636
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:49,949
That's the idea.

637
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:53,617
So Buffy was a big inspiration.

638
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:55,272
Yes sir.

639
01:00:55,632 --> 01:00:56,633
Thank you, that was a great talk.

640
01:00:57,193 --> 01:01:01,795
I'm a narrative designer and occasional composer and I think over the last half hour you melted my brain.

641
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:20,022
My question is, I'm curious to know, because of those two hats I wear, what was the sort of interactivity during the writing process, because you said David had sort of come with a fairly put together concept, but what was the interactivity between the music and the musical, which of course you know you'd expect

642
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:31,400
I don't know, a torch song, and back one closer, 11 o'clock number, whatever, between that and the narrative side of things, and how did they talk to each other during the course of putting this together?

643
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:32,100
It's a great question.

644
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,041
Short version, it was a lot of back and forth.

645
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:36,882
It was a lot of, oh, you know, this is an interesting moment.

646
01:01:36,962 --> 01:01:37,682
Let's expand this.

647
01:01:37,722 --> 01:01:39,083
We can make this a full-on number.

648
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:43,724
This originally was just a passing comment, but there's really major narrative implications for this that I think we're overlooking.

649
01:01:43,764 --> 01:01:44,744
What if we built this out?

650
01:01:44,864 --> 01:01:48,805
Or, hey, we thought we'd stick a number here, but let's get to the point of this scene faster and whatever.

651
01:01:48,845 --> 01:01:50,206
And like I said, David was really

652
01:01:50,906 --> 01:01:50,966
of

653
01:02:05,803 --> 01:02:07,624
is a complete insanity.

654
01:02:07,664 --> 01:02:23,415
I mean the thing is analyzing every song you've done in the game and it's just it's absolute it took us it took us months and that was one where we would have to jump on a call with him every couple of days and go okay we want the player to do this and then we want to bring a reference back from this earlier song but I want to know is that even possible?

655
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:28,137
And he would go, oh, well, no, actually, because if you're talking to this person, it means you didn't talk to them in this earlier scene.

656
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:31,378
And the only reason this person's in the scene is because you did talk to them.

657
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:38,742
And so it was like, we had to constantly have him hold our hands to even know all the millions of branches to know what even should be on the menu.

658
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:41,343
And that was just, yeah, just constant slack.

659
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:41,603
Yes.

660
01:02:42,863 --> 01:02:43,864
And a lot of Zoom calls.

661
01:02:44,544 --> 01:02:44,804
Awesome.

662
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:45,084
Thank you.

663
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:45,545
Yeah.

664
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:46,265
My pleasure.

665
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:47,985
Hi there.

666
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:49,587
First off, I'm super excited.

667
01:02:49,607 --> 01:02:54,210
I've been following this since the Fig campaign, so just love seeing this come to fruition.

668
01:02:54,791 --> 01:03:04,618
I'm really curious, coming from the Dragon Age, Mass Effect style of storytelling, I know that a lot of people reach the moments for decision and they take a long time.

669
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:13,145
So when you're dealing with something like a musical where there's a time component to it and you're working with the music and the background trying to keep things in a general

670
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:14,460
song format

671
01:03:33,738 --> 01:03:35,600
what is, in effect, your character class.

672
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:47,148
Because that unlocks a whole other thing I don't want to get into, but there's a whole idea of the first time the player has made this choice, we don't want to just assume that they've played other Bioware games or something and would just immediately understand what this is.

673
01:03:47,509 --> 01:03:50,871
So this one actually goes into an instrumental infinite loop.

674
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:54,434
It's the only one in the entire game that does that.

675
01:03:54,474 --> 01:04:00,679
Because otherwise, I said, the trade-off of the player constantly feeling like they're on a rail

676
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:06,562
is that it can feel like a musical number in a way that you fully sacrifice if you take that away.

677
01:04:06,702 --> 01:04:16,828
Because my little mental image fantasy is if you're playing the game and I'm kind of over here like doing laundry and I'm not fully paying attention, I should think that you're just watching a musical.

678
01:04:17,209 --> 01:04:23,272
It shouldn't occur to me that you're driving it because that then sounds like a real musical.

679
01:04:23,632 --> 01:04:26,794
It just turns out that there's like tens of thousands of things you could have done.

680
01:04:27,315 --> 01:04:27,715
And so

681
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:45,400
The way to achieve that, one of the potential sacrifices and possibly a weakness of the format we chose is that you have a time limit to make these choices and after trial and erroring a million different possibilities of how to contend with them, what if they just don't click on one?

682
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,781
We ended up basically going, it's just going to pick one at random.

683
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:54,646
Because if we don't pick one at random, it becomes, well, why did it choose, what's so important about that?

684
01:04:54,706 --> 01:04:59,369
And it was very important to me that it never feel like there's a right and a wrong or a canonical answer versus a not.

685
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:02,631
It should really feel like, no, no, no, this is about role playing.

686
01:05:02,651 --> 01:05:04,292
This is creating your story.

687
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:12,997
And so random felt like the best way to get to that than, OK, well, I secretly think the red one is the best version, so I'm going to make you do that if you do nothing.

688
01:05:13,057 --> 01:05:13,538
It's like, no, no, no.

689
01:05:14,658 --> 01:05:16,660
that's even less agency I thought.

690
01:05:17,941 --> 01:05:20,323
To me it's not my favorite aspect but it felt like a necessary

691
01:05:21,314 --> 01:05:30,617
compromise to make, because the infinite looping that you would run into if you wanted to try to not have that undermines the musicality of it so dramatically.

692
01:05:30,657 --> 01:05:31,237
We tried it.

693
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:35,318
Again, we experimented on a lot of prototypes and things like that, but that's where we ended up on that.

694
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:42,480
It's a very savvy question, because you wouldn't believe the amount of hours we spent sort of sweating bullets over, what do we do with it?

695
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,141
This is a really interesting design challenge.

696
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:46,323
You end up with Jeopardy music at some point.

697
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:47,124
I think I'm out of time.

698
01:05:47,164 --> 01:05:47,785
Is that what that means?

699
01:05:47,805 --> 01:05:48,065
All right.

700
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:51,269
I'll just go hang out outside and we can address... Thank you all.

701
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,891
Blah, blah, blah.

702
01:05:53,012 --> 01:05:54,333
Evaluation forms.

703
01:05:54,894 --> 01:05:56,256
You know, be nice to each other.

704
01:05:57,177 --> 01:05:57,577
Thank you.
