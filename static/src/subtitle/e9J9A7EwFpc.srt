00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,211
Hello, welcome to Sewing, a Musical Patchwork,

2
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,532
the Music of Sackboy, A Big Adventure.

3
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,013
I'm Jay Waters.

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,475
I'm the game's audio director based over at Sumo Sheffield.

5
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,616
Hi, I'm Joe Thwaites.

6
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:24,078
I'm principal composer and music producer from PlayStation's

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,038
Creative Arts team.

8
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:29,260
And I'm James Marshall, music supervisor on this project,

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,181
also from the Creative Arts team.

10
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:38,701
We've been really pleased to see such amazing feedback since the release of Sackboy,

11
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:41,082
a great deal of that with regards to the music.

12
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:45,005
Today, we'll hopefully give you an insight into some of the decisions and methods

13
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:47,887
behind the soundtrack, provide a little look under the hood,

14
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,429
and also touch on how we used a diverse roster of tracks

15
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:54,091
to help set the tone throughout the various worlds.

16
00:00:56,595 --> 00:01:00,038
I'm going to provide a deeper look into the practical approaches we took,

17
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:04,963
including the creative and technical challenges with implementing music in-game

18
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:07,164
and composing a theme for the game.

19
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:13,690
And we'll also look at how the overall brief led to new ways of using licensed and bespoke music,

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,254
ultimately tying together many threads to make a cohesive experience for the players.

21
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:25,040
Starting with a look back at the previous titles in the franchise,

22
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,361
We examined what the core components of the soundtracks were,

23
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,442
many of them centred around the concept of play, create, share,

24
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,983
and its support for user-generated content.

25
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:39,364
What this meant was that interactive music needed to have a simple system

26
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:42,545
that could be easily implemented by players in their own creations.

27
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:46,867
It also meant that licensed music generally remained a linear experience.

28
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:53,014
And as Jay mentioned, the franchise is well known for the play, create, share concept,

29
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:59,436
but we wanted to focus solely on play and that allowed us to keep the balance of licensed and composed music,

30
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:04,496
but meant we had a greater chance of a curated approach when it came to selecting the music itself.

31
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:13,038
So without these limitations, moving forward meant we were able to explore a much more narrative led soundtrack,

32
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:18,139
focusing more on thematic materials such as world themes, characters and story beats.

33
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:24,188
We also had a much bigger game to think about, with the level count hitting over 90 in total.

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,873
We also had a change from composed levels, where a composer would look just after a specific level

35
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:36,856
or section of the game, to composer curators, where a composer's sound would actually influence

36
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,078
the whole of that music of that world.

37
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:45,671
And we also wanted to move away from just dropping in licensed tracks wholesale and take a more

38
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:51,495
detailed deep implementation approach where each track fit a level aligning the licensed music

39
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:59,982
with the detail we can obtain from a composed score. When we first began talking to the folks

40
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:05,786
at Creative Arts Team we took with us a deck of audio goals. This particular slide served as an

41
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,007
ideal jumping off point.

42
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:11,887
Obviously this touches on more than just music here, but it gives a good idea of some of the

43
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:17,169
higher level ambitions we had for the franchise. First and foremost we wanted to support the art

44
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:22,511
direction as best we could, the concept of which was a crafted world imagined by a child.

45
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:27,993
Fantastic Meets the Familiar was the general strap line with worlds set within real world

46
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:32,895
environments and playing host to imaginary locations crafted by a child at play.

47
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:37,947
Through the sound, we wanted to support this by utilizing tangible objects

48
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:42,168
and accessible source material combined with added layers of imagination.

49
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:47,569
We also wanted to look at ways in which we could somehow marry the sound design

50
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:48,870
more closely with the music.

51
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,991
We wanted to bring a certain harmony to the game's worlds.

52
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:56,012
We were looking to do this by taking a music first approach to sound design.

53
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,733
This meaning that any tonal or potentially musical elements

54
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,034
of the sound effects we wanted to treat more as musical instruments.

55
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:05,485
We'll touch a bit more on this a little later.

56
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:12,789
Unsurprisingly, we really wanted to push towards assembling a really groundbreaking soundtrack.

57
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:19,273
We wanted to investigate ways in which we could revolutionise implementation of licensed music.

58
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:25,877
And we wanted to further push the franchise's trademark eclectic mix by expanding it in all directions.

59
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:33,182
And finally, we wanted to look at ways in which we could further innovate development of the franchise's identity.

60
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:38,749
paying close attention to attention to its subtlety, nuance and attention to detail,

61
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,913
its immersive world full of charm, joy and humour,

62
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:44,936
as well as its unique juxtaposition of concepts.

63
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,882
Following this up, we presented them with a wish list

64
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:53,986
detailing some of the musical content we wanted to explore.

65
00:04:55,975 --> 00:05:00,556
Starting off, major artists, something that will be fairly new territory for the game,

66
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:04,497
and aligning with the drive towards a more AAA game experience.

67
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:10,299
This time we really wanted to raise the bar in terms of securing more mainstream and recognisable artists.

68
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,641
And artist exclusives, an area we experimented with on LBP3, and we're keen to develop further in this game,

69
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:23,723
working in close collaboration with established artists in the composition of bespoke music.

70
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:34,030
Classics. We also saw great potential in the use of more vintage material and were keen to experiment with interactive implementation where possible.

71
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:44,763
Similarly, with covers, we had a number of ideas for expanding the use of covers, selecting original arrangements of classic songs or commissioning somewhat more unique approaches.

72
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:53,012
Quite befitting of the game's general aesthetic, we were keen to explore interesting and effective use of mashup tracks,

73
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:58,334
in particular the prospect of using existing level music in interesting new combinations.

74
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:03,835
We also wanted to push further to discover more niche artists and performers,

75
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,456
something for which the franchise is now synonymous.

76
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,877
And above all, we just wanted to have some fun,

77
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:14,418
striving for opportunities that might raise a smile or two from the player.

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,522
So from the start of the project, we had a rough outline of the overall structure of the game.

79
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:26,963
We had a set of distinct worlds, which you can see on this slide here,

80
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:30,784
each with their own art style, gameplay mechanics, narrative hooks.

81
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,565
We had a general outline of the types of levels that would be in each world as well,

82
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:41,547
from ride-ons to more exploratory, more open levels, side-scrollers, things like that.

83
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,500
The team had already been working on prototypes for the music levels,

84
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,800
which we're going to touch on later,

85
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,400
so we knew we had to include those across the game

86
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,541
with one per world where we could manage it.

87
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,701
Jay also mentioned the covers,

88
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:55,982
and this was another thing that we wanted to include

89
00:06:56,882 --> 00:07:01,343
throughout the game, but again on a one-per-world basis or so.

90
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:04,203
With both of these, we knew we had to strike a balance

91
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:05,944
that would keep the player surprised

92
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,784
without oversaturating the concepts.

93
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:10,004
Too many, and they'd become predictable.

94
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,165
Too few, and they'd come across as a gimmick.

95
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:14,452
The whole game then had to have through lines,

96
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:18,453
so Joe is going to touch on that later when talking about thematic material.

97
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,054
But we also had things such as cut scenes and a world map,

98
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:25,956
which did the heavy lifting of taking these worlds with their disparate sound palettes

99
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:29,557
and making them feel naturally cohesive across the project.

100
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:33,778
So let's have a look at some of these levels and worlds themselves.

101
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,482
So the worlds were fairly archetypal when it came to design.

102
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:57,204
You had a water world, a world set in space, but we knew with the esoteric nature of the franchise

103
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:01,445
we could take things in a different direction. This first world, which you can see concept art

104
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:04,646
for here, is set across a Tibetan-esque mountaintop.

105
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:10,759
The art design itself incorporates eastern elements, so it was a logical step to look for music which did the same.

106
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,942
Anderlea, a lot of alternative and psychedelic music, shares that similar kind of sound palette,

107
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,145
and these were the types of songs many fans associated with the franchise.

108
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:26,048
You can hear in this particular track certain instrumentation which fit this brief.

109
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:29,515
And by having it as the first set of music encountered,

110
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,758
with its bright, inviting, and lively beat,

111
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:35,400
not only did it thematically fit the design,

112
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,064
it also acted as a reassuring familiarity for longtime fans of the series.

113
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:44,867
Moving to the colossal canopy, our Amazon-esque world.

114
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:59,055
So you can hear here with this great track by Brian D'Oliveira,

115
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:06,940
it's incorporating tribal drums, organic instrumentation, you've got a very, very

116
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,343
subtle element of ethnotronica in there, which was another thing that we looked at when we

117
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:16,566
looked at this particular world. And given that there were a lot of elements from South America,

118
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:21,550
we brought those inspirations in to give it a real kind of carnival vibe as well.

119
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,648
Moving to the Undersea World,

120
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:35,716
and this very jazzy cover of Grieg reinterpreted by Jim Fowler.

121
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,943
The Kingdom of Krablantus was a world featuring lots and lots of

122
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:47,106
antique furniture in the background and these lush textures.

123
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:52,220
And this particular set dressing inspired us to look at older styles of music,

124
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,623
so classical, jazz, swing, and then often putting our own contemporary spin on things.

125
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:03,906
And you can hear that with this new interpretation of a classical piece.

126
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:14,011
We then also went in completely the opposite direction at the interstellar junction.

127
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:23,086
And you can hear with this track, it's synths, synths and more synths.

128
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:35,470
This was one of our checkboxes ticked with an artist exclusive

129
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,691
by the Glitch Shop producer Opio.

130
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:42,272
And this aesthetic went throughout the space world

131
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:44,133
where it was electronic music.

132
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:49,099
almost a history of electronic music as you went through the world itself,

133
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,362
with synths, beats, breaks, and a slightly darker edge

134
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:59,746
as things are heating up for Sackboy as he makes his way through his adventure.

135
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:03,048
And then lastly...

136
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,633
the final world, the center of QWAF World, with its previous...

137
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:18,117
designs of all the assets from previous worlds mixed together in a chaotic maelstrom by the

138
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:23,679
antagonist Vex. So we looked at that for inspiration and in this remix from 2Metalo

139
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,884
you can hear it's not only playfully malevolent but it also takes eight or so tracks previously

140
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:40,326
used throughout the game and makes a mashup again ticking a box that we wanted to achieve.

141
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:49,741
to create this delightfully demonic but very very funky mashup. And we were always considering the

142
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:54,366
level design when it came to the music and always looking for opportunities where music and visuals

143
00:11:54,807 --> 00:12:02,655
would inform each other. But how did we select the songs for those levels? It all began

144
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:08,038
with a massive playlist of around 100 or so songs,

145
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,660
an extensive collection of anything we could think

146
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,241
would possibly work for a world.

147
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,743
It was more of a wishlist than anyone could feed in

148
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:17,505
with what they wanted to possibly hear in the game.

149
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:19,899
And then as the levels were blocked out,

150
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:23,700
we placed them in their earliest form to gauge the general vibe.

151
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,982
This allowed us to create a smaller subset of songs with about 20 to 30.

152
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:32,424
And it was here where we looked at what the general vibe of the level was.

153
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:36,545
Was it going to be fast-paced, a bit more chaotic, or something more laid back?

154
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,147
Did it have a set trajectory, like on rails levels?

155
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:44,448
Or was it a bit more free form, allowing the player to explore at their own will?

156
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:51,529
The former was easier to anticipate how a track might play out as the general time between A and B

157
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:56,012
was going to be pretty much similar throughout the level. But levels that were more freeform

158
00:12:56,332 --> 00:13:01,796
and had a hub area required a different approach as players could spend a lot of time in one area

159
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:07,980
or they could go in random order between different sections of the level. So this allowed us to gauge

160
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,642
whether the level was going to be more suited for a composed or a licensed track.

161
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:16,728
If a license track looked like it would work, we'd find those which tick the correct boxes.

162
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:22,311
Did it have the necessary files that we might be able to use? Was it likely to be in budget?

163
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:29,096
Once we had these, we would go out for approval on those particular tracks, and then approvals

164
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:34,479
would come back depending on the request, which would give us around one or two songs

165
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,862
that we could consider for the level. If it looked like the license track would work,

166
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,263
implementation would start.

167
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:46,570
If it looked like it would be more of a composed level, we'd start a brief, discuss it with the

168
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:53,435
composer and begin that process. We did have one thing that helped us throughout the project. One

169
00:13:53,475 --> 00:13:59,780
challenge that we encountered earlier on is that music's extremely subjective and the particular

170
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,764
process here involved a lot of stakeholders. As the importance of music grew throughout

171
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:09,207
the project and developed, we created this flowchart in a bid to slightly substantiate

172
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:15,634
the music choices as a way for us to make sure any songs that we considered met the criteria we needed for the game.

173
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:21,564
This particular portion of the chart served as an initial check and was there to remove subjectivity.

174
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:27,209
Given that Sackboy, with the type of game it is, there were a lot of songs that fit the vibe,

175
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:34,113
but maybe they didn't tick the other boxes. So we'd look at the flowchart. If there was someone

176
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:38,336
who was particularly attached to a song, we'd consult with the flowchart, refer back to it,

177
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:43,239
and if it didn't tick the boxes, unfortunately, the song would be set aside. When it came to

178
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,403
implementing, Joe's going to pick up on how that was used in terms of getting those songs in the

179
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:49,603
game.

180
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:59,139
James. As we mentioned, because of the heritage of the game, we knew that we wanted to incorporate

181
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,202
licensed music and we also knew that we wanted to embed the music into the game

182
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:07,065
in a way that was seamless and helped score each player's experience.

183
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:17,566
So regardless of whether the track was composed or licensed, once we had the track that fitted the theme and the tone of the level, we needed to make sure a number of things.

184
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:23,011
One, the track had enough variation to maintain interest for the duration of the level.

185
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:29,356
We'd often find a track that would fit perfectly to the brief, but we soon realised that it didn't really move from one or two chord progressions.

186
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:33,000
And within those chord progressions, if you take away the lyrics and the...

187
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:38,557
of the vocals, it's not really going to go anywhere, so we need to go back to the drawing board.

188
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:43,761
We also need to make sure that we had enough stems for the track so that we could rearrange

189
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:48,344
and embellish the track to best fit it into the level. We had some great tracks that we

190
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:52,647
couldn't use because we didn't have access to the stems, or it's an old track and the

191
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,108
stems themselves didn't actually exist.

192
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,031
And then we also needed to make sure that we had the rights to use it in the game how we wanted to use it.

193
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:11,014
So the rights holders needed to be on board and give us permission to break the track up into the stems and use it in our implementation system.

194
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:20,447
So once we had the track and its stems, we would begin our initial implementation.

195
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,890
The goal here was to have a system where we could add the component parts of the track

196
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,792
and the game would reconstruct these elements at runtime.

197
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,095
It wouldn't matter if it was a licensed track or a composed track,

198
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:33,296
they'd both be implemented in the same way.

199
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,835
So we wanted each track to feel unique and change depending on the player's route or play style through the level.

200
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:48,303
But most importantly, we wanted to connect with the narrative of the game and really help propel Sackboy's journey through the various levels in the game.

201
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:57,552
So to do this, we had some general high-level systems and also some bespoke systems for individual levels to keep the music fresh and interesting throughout.

202
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:03,819
So the basic system comprised of four implementation techniques, which many of you will be familiar with.

203
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:14,863
Horizontal re-sequencing, which is this idea of splitting the track into multiple loopable chunks and then moving through them as you move through the game.

204
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:20,603
Vertical layering, which is this idea of splitting each track into multiple layers

205
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,947
that can be added and removed at runtime.

206
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:26,934
So, you know, splitting it into drums, bass, vocals,

207
00:17:26,974 --> 00:17:29,719
and then bringing in the drums or the bass at certain points in the game.

208
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:36,299
Stingers and embellishments, which were short musical elements that would be triggered by

209
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:41,006
gameplay events, these kind of more instant things. If you get a pickup or something like

210
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:45,713
that you get stinger or embellishments being kind of additional little bits of music that

211
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,195
we add on to kind of license tracks.

212
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:58,684
And finally, runtime processing, which was this idea of using filters and effects that manipulate the music at runtime, depending on what the player's doing.

213
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,365
And I'm going to show a quick demo of each of those and how we use them in Sackboy.

214
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:10,266
So the first thing we did was to split each track into these loopable sections.

215
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:15,667
Each section needed to maintain interest if the player stuck around in an area for a long period of time,

216
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,487
so we'd spend...

217
00:18:18,023 --> 00:18:22,367
a lot of time with these tracks, extending them and doing multiple arrangements and variations

218
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:27,592
for each of the sections of the music so that if Sackboy stays in one space,

219
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:30,935
the music doesn't get boring and it kind of keeps evolving and changing.

220
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:39,454
Generally in the game the music moves on to the next section of the track as you move through the

221
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:44,741
checkpoints in a level. So you can hear in this video as Sackboy moves over each of the checkpoints

222
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:47,564
the next kind of section of music will be queued up.

223
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:53,327
And it'll be queued up in different ways depending on how quickly we want to transition.

224
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:58,569
So it might be queued up on the next bar, it might be queued up on the end of that section,

225
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:02,570
or the end of that melody, or it might be queued up immediately if it needs to happen quickly.

226
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,791
And that really depended on how it was going to be used in the game.

227
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,472
And in this video you'll see a couple of different examples.

228
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,633
The first couple of checkpoints, it kind of lines it up.

229
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:13,463
to be the end of the section.

230
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:14,764
So whenever that section finishes,

231
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:16,046
it kind of naturally moves on.

232
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:17,687
But then the final one that you'll see

233
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,389
when you get shot out of the flower cannon,

234
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,511
it moves on quite a bit quicker

235
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:25,456
because it needs to, the music opens up at that point

236
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:27,798
and changes kind of more dramatically.

237
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,500
But I'll show you what I mean in this video.

238
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,521
Let's start that.

239
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:03,226
So we've now moved into the first loop and this will stick around in this kind of verse

240
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:07,073
version and it'll go through different arrangements of this verse whilst you stick around in this area.

241
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:44,580
So we've moved to the second checkpoint and now we bring in the chorus.

242
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:06,253
The third checkpoint lines up the next part of the music, which goes into the bridge.

243
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,397
And that was the transition that happened a lot quicker because we're kind of opening up the music now into this kind of more

244
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,682
environmental, opium, kind of ambient version.

245
00:21:57,937 --> 00:22:02,960
That last clip was just a good example of how using this horizontal resequencing we can really

246
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,383
end with a bang on these tracks so they kind of sync up to the landing on the scoreboard and

247
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:13,204
yeah it makes a real difference for those kind of moments when you really want to

248
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:17,647
finish and change the music up and yeah for the endings it works really nicely.

249
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:27,287
So the horizontal re-sequencing helped create momentum as you move through the levels, but we

250
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:33,392
also wanted multiple layers vertically to react to gameplay events whilst you are in each of those

251
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:39,297
areas. So we split all of our music into roughly the same sections that could be manipulated at

252
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:39,797
runtime.

253
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:46,291
These were generally categorized as drums, bass, lead, accompaniment, and vocals.

254
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:50,533
Obviously it depends on the kind of content of the track if we could split it into those groups,

255
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:56,775
and sometimes those groups varied a little bit. But yeah, what that allowed us to do was bring

256
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:59,417
in these different elements depending on what was going on in the game.

257
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:05,276
So the previous video showed how this would help with arrangements where we could drop out a lead

258
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:11,162
line if the player stayed in one area, but we also hooked off some of the game mechanics such as

259
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:15,567
we would drop out the drums if Sackboy stands idle for a period of time.

260
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:20,282
or bringing in lyrics at key moments of gameplay,

261
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:22,245
which in this clip I'll show in a moment,

262
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:25,989
there's a really nice moment where you open these gates

263
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,633
and there's some lyrics that you appropriately sing

264
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:29,714
open those gates,

265
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:32,578
and it works really nicely with that moment.

266
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:41,896
And also in this video, we've got a clip showing how we use layers to build towards progression of objectives.

267
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:48,180
So as you move towards a boss door and you get closer to a boss door, we bring in more and more layers of a track.

268
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,983
And then as you move further away, those layers dissipate and fall away.

269
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:55,926
So it's more intense as you get close to the boss door. So let's take a look at this video.

270
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:19,486
You can see the Y's overlay there showing the different layers that are playing at

271
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:19,947
the moment.

272
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:30,917
And then the drums kick back in when Sackboy starts moving again.

273
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:13,556
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm going to try to make it work.

274
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,377
I'm going to try to make it work.

275
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:16,978
I'm going to try to make it work.

276
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,259
I'm going to try to make it work.

277
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,304
This was our cover of Mars done by Opieo.

278
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:43,668
You can hear as you move away the layers drop out and as you move closer they come back in.

279
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:13,535
Using the layers really allowed us to build seamlessly into that moment and really build

280
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:17,302
up to the boss door and when you go through it kind of having that as a real moment,

281
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:21,129
which we wouldn't be able to do with just the horizontal re-sequencing.

282
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:28,004
So some events in the game happen immediately and we wanted the music to reward the player with

283
00:26:28,564 --> 00:26:33,747
a flourish or an embellishment. So on top of the horizontal re-sequencing stuff and the vertical

284
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:38,390
layering, we also used musical stingers and embellishments to react quickly to gameplay

285
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,133
events such as picking up items or helping to smooth over transitions.

286
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:49,914
So in this video, there's a couple of examples of moments where a Sackboy does something in the gameplay,

287
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,695
and it's rewarded with a small stinger.

288
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:59,236
And I should note that all of the stingers are taken from the music itself in that level,

289
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:02,797
so you'll hear that they're kind of created by the sounds of the track itself,

290
00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:06,018
and that really sits them in that kind of musical world.

291
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,739
But it meant we ended up with hundreds and hundreds of stingers throughout the game.

292
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,199
Let's have a look at that video.

293
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:22,645
This final example here is an example of using a stinger to help smooth over a transition.

294
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:25,346
So you get a stinger when you go into the flower cannon.

295
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:37,072
And it just makes more of a moment of that transition and helps kind of,

296
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:41,034
yeah, smooth over any rough edges, which is a really great way of using them.

297
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:48,873
And as well as actual edits and embellishments of the musical content, we also looked at applying

298
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:54,436
real-time effects to really embed the music into the world. The main example of this is probably

299
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:59,759
when you enter the bonus rooms in the game. The bonus rooms are the kind of side rooms from the

300
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,802
main level where you go in and find bonus content for the level. And in this case you normally go

301
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:06,563
through a zipped door.

302
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:12,873
And what we do is we worldize the music and position it in 3D on the doorway.

303
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:16,596
And we filter it depending on if the doorway is open or closed.

304
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:18,597
So if the doorway is open, we allow more through.

305
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:20,599
And when it's closed, we filter more out.

306
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:23,141
And then when you return back to the main level,

307
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,864
you get the full track in all its glory again.

308
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:30,468
Yeah, and it creates this really nice feeling of kind of

309
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,550
being away from the level and leaving the music behind.

310
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:41,252
And we also use filters to make music more dynamic in other places and we do it to adapt to

311
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:45,693
gameplay events such as when you go in those flower cannons doing a low pass filter on the music

312
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:52,054
and similarly when Sackboy loses a life we do kind of a filter sweep and the music kind of

313
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:56,235
dissipates away and this just creates a really nice dynamic flow of the music which really

314
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:59,836
embeds it into the world. So I've got a video a couple of examples of that.

315
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,282
Good to see you again, fellow explorer.

316
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,784
You won't believe it, but I finally found him.

317
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:21,785
Yeah, Big Moe, the real-

318
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:22,126
Ow!

319
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:25,088
Yeah, that's what a bite from Moe would feel like.

320
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,430
Here, why don't you hang on to this?

321
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,852
Think it's one of his eggs, but you can handle yourself.

322
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,141
Be lucky, sack boy.

323
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:56,798
This one's an example of how we approach something that was specific to a level.

324
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:28,643
Oi, sack boy! Don't go bruising me nanas!

325
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:35,952
There are stock and trade, imagination food. Export them all over Craftworld!

326
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:53,316
So these techniques kind of acted as a foundation to which we built on top of,

327
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,738
and we did kind of more of the level-specific stuff.

328
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:58,279
But on top of that, we did some really cool stuff with sound,

329
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,861
and I'll pass over to Jay to talk about that stuff.

330
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:08,025
So as we hinted at earlier, we also wanted to explore how we could push

331
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:11,347
musical interactivity into other areas of the sound.

332
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,104
Quite a large number of the sound effects are rich in tonal elements,

333
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:18,646
especially those associated with UI or player messaging.

334
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:22,509
As a result, we began thinking of ways in which we could implement these sounds

335
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:25,991
a little more elegantly in such a way that they become more intrinsic

336
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:27,352
to the musical experience.

337
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:31,035
It's ultimately led to the development of what we ended up referring to

338
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:33,596
as a harmony system and rhythm manager.

339
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:38,259
The harmony system enabled sound designers to create sound effects

340
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,361
that could adapt to the key signature of the accompanying music track.

341
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,132
The rhythm manager was more of a suite of tools

342
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,914
that enabled us to synchronize sound, gameplay events,

343
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:51,177
and animations to bar beats or custom markers

344
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:51,978
within the score.

345
00:32:52,758 --> 00:32:54,820
And we'll touch on this a little more shortly.

346
00:32:57,702 --> 00:33:00,505
So technically, the harmony system is quite simple.

347
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,506
In each level, the key signature is

348
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,889
defined by a set state component in Unreal Blueprint.

349
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,992
When a sound is triggered, the corresponding wise event

350
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:10,373
plays a combination of layers.

351
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:13,506
With any tonal elements arranged in switch containers,

352
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,689
basic one shots would generally tune to the root or tonic,

353
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:21,310
whereas more complex arrangements

354
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,352
might trigger an interval, arpeggio, or a short melody

355
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,413
by the use of sequence containers.

356
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:31,196
Here's a quick example in Wwise.

357
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,118
This particular event is the collection sound effect

358
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,160
for void energy, which is a rare collectible that players

359
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,661
can use to unlock levels in the Knitted Knight trials.

360
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,012
This is what it sounds like.

361
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:52,241
And you can see how the sound is comprised of multiple layers

362
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:56,684
with the riser, snare hit and sting elements being consistent across keys.

363
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,708
However, both the bass drop and bass rise elements are tuned

364
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:04,591
with the component source sounds held within corresponding switch containers

365
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,833
and subsequently set by the key state.

366
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:13,351
And here that sound is in game along with a few other examples of the musical sound effects.

367
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,244
One thing that was really important to us from the beginning of this project was bringing the game together with a theme.

368
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:57,468
We knew that each world and individual level was going to be unique, so we wanted to have a thread that really pulled it all together

369
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:00,531
and made it feel like a cohesive experience.

370
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:04,834
So early on we looked at writing a couple of short melodies that would go on to become

371
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,195
Sackboy's theme.

372
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:14,411
As the theme was going to be integrated throughout the game, we wanted something that was super simple and that could be utilised in any style.

373
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:19,354
So the main hook needed to be able to work as a fanfare to highlight important moments in the game,

374
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:25,156
but it also needed to set over all the different styles of the space world and the Amazon world and the Himalayan world,

375
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,417
and how it was going to work in all these different styles.

376
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:33,412
So we ended up writing three key melodies which came together to create Sackboy's theme.

377
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:39,037
We have a melody that represents Sackboy as a hero, we have a melody that represents Loom,

378
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:43,821
which is Sackboy's hometown, and we have a melody that represents the call to adventure,

379
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:50,307
which we'd use in a lot of the cutscenes when Scarlet would kind of help Sackboy onto the next thing.

380
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:55,572
So I thought it'd be good to share a little tour of the development of one of those themes.

381
00:37:55,592 --> 00:38:01,538
We're going to look at Sackboy's Hero theme and how it started with a super simple piano melody.

382
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:09,286
Then we did a kind of a scratch guitar demo of how it's going to sound with kind of mandolins and guitars and stuff, which kind of.

383
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:13,230
was a bit of a foundation of Sackboy's sound.

384
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,193
And then the MIDI demo shows kind of the accompanying stuff that we built around that.

385
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:24,256
And then finally, the final version of it with the recorded instruments.

386
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:27,618
We did some kind of, we did some choir recordings at Air Studio,

387
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,100
and we also did some string recordings at Air Studio as well.

388
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,501
And that's all mixed in in the final version.

389
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:34,441
So let's have a look at that.

390
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:10,809
Don't forget to remember to measure between 0.5 and 6.5.

391
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:14,078
Most notably, the theme plays a big part in the cutscenes, which are the key moments where the narrative moves forward.

392
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:21,405
And our cutscene composer, Nick Foster, did an absolutely outstanding job of integrating the different themes into the different cutscenes.

393
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:29,953
But on top of this, we also shared the theme with each of our world composers and world map composer to integrate into their level compositions.

394
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:37,517
And this is when everything really started to tie together, when you start hearing it in all the different worlds and it starts popping up all over the place.

395
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:43,021
We then took the step even further and we also embellished some of the license tracks that we did.

396
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:47,783
We added kind of additional layers on top of some of the license tracks to feature the theme.

397
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:51,671
And finally, we also put the theme as a stinger,

398
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:54,993
which is attached to the main collectible in the game,

399
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,194
which are the dream robs.

400
00:40:57,115 --> 00:40:58,655
And to do this, we actually ended up

401
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:02,118
writing a specific stinger for every level in the game

402
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:04,019
so that when you collect those dream

403
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:06,080
robs in the different levels, it plays

404
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,523
in the same key, tempo, time signature, and kind of groove

405
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:12,384
and instrumentation of that level.

406
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:14,625
So it really sits in with the world.

407
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:22,829
I'm just going to show a quick video showing a handful of the places where you can see the theme pop up in some of the different variations of it.

408
00:42:18,461 --> 00:42:22,264
The world maps were a great opportunity for the themes to kind of just flow in on the

409
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:27,148
winds and kind of dissipate and appear and disappear when needed.

410
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:18,074
Oi, sack boy! Don't go bruising me nanas!

411
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:22,815
There are stock and trade. Imagination food.

412
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:39,977
That track there was a really good example of embellishing a licensed track with the theme.

413
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:43,378
So the brass band was recorded once we'd secured the track,

414
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,060
and then it was embedded on top of it to really work with the level.

415
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,421
So you can see the theme pops up in a ton of places as you play through.

416
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:58,883
Sometimes it's very subtle, sometimes less subtle, but what it does is it creates this

417
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:03,365
unified language that really helps pull the whole game together under one umbrella.

418
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:15,437
What's probably a fitting note to end on is what is essentially the culmination of most of the ambitions and technical approaches discussed so far.

419
00:45:16,238 --> 00:45:23,822
Music levels, as they were generally referred to, are a small selection of special levels in which the music plays a much bigger part in the experience.

420
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:26,964
Used as a showcase for some of the game's bigger hits,

421
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:33,908
music levels were designed in reverse, with the accompanying track being used to inform level design.

422
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:39,280
And subsequently providing a rhythm and structure around which the whole level moves and dances.

423
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:43,606
And of course, these were all the products of the aforementioned rhythm manager,

424
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:51,115
which provided all disciplines with access to bar beat and custom marker callbacks.

425
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:54,018
So.

426
00:45:54,871 --> 00:46:00,113
You've seen how we, what our goals were across the game, but what were specifically our goals

427
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:04,995
for these levels. So we knew we wanted to elevate and expand upon the franchise's use

428
00:46:05,495 --> 00:46:08,556
of licensed music. It is a franchise known for licensed music,

429
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:11,817
and we knew we wanted to take that one step further and really kind of...

430
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:20,425
level up the use. We knew that we wanted to broaden the audience via more recognizable and well-known songs.

431
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:26,208
The game and the franchise, they're well known for using slightly more left field, slightly more

432
00:46:26,268 --> 00:46:32,831
esoteric choices, so incorporating chart-topping hits, we had to do it in a way that was going to

433
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:39,534
be special. We knew we wanted to present the songs respectfully and unembellished. These were very

434
00:46:39,654 --> 00:46:41,315
recognizable tracks and we wanted people.

435
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:48,327
to hear them as if they'd hear them listening in their car radio or, you know, just in their daily

436
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:53,270
life. We didn't want to make them unrecognizable. We wanted to keep them within the brief of the

437
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:59,133
game and the worlds if we could as well. And while there were very loose rules around where they sat,

438
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:06,578
we did try and fit them in either to a narrative beat or within the general theme of the world.

439
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:10,620
And as they were going to be memorable musical moments.

440
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:17,014
We still didn't want to confine the player's intentions, so we wanted to keep it as free

441
00:47:17,054 --> 00:47:21,316
form as possible and allow the players to explore without forcing them through a level

442
00:47:21,737 --> 00:47:24,779
at the pace of the song. That was probably one of the bigger challenges

443
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,441
and Jay's going to touch on how we had a look at that next.

444
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:35,905
So the concept of music levels began as part of some wider prototyping by Level Design.

445
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:42,898
At the time, we were building simple gray box levels, designing basic motifs to single shot drum hits and basic loops.

446
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,001
Upon seeing the potential, we soon progressed to prototyping with licensed music,

447
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,763
trying out a number of different genres to get a better idea of what worked.

448
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,682
Entering production, we had a clearer vision on what we wanted to achieve.

449
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:02,985
These moments needed to be more of an experience rather than just another level.

450
00:48:03,565 --> 00:48:07,608
They needed to unite art, animation, music, sound and gameplay.

451
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:12,932
And the ambition was that the end result would be worthy of a well choreographed music video.

452
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:18,484
Another goal we all agreed on was that these levels should never feel on rails.

453
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:21,705
We wanted to give players the freedom to move at their own pace,

454
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:26,847
while we do the work behind the scenes to ensure the experience remains seamless and consistent.

455
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:33,068
Now one of the main challenges from a music point of view was concerning how we could

456
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:36,829
preserve the integrity of the original tracks, as James has just mentioned.

457
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:40,309
These were all well-known songs, complete with vocals,

458
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:42,510
so it was important that their arrangements were never

459
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,651
pulled too far away from what the audience would

460
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,431
be familiar with.

461
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:50,414
We approached this by treating them more as a 12-inch remix.

462
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:53,815
In a similar way to the process described by Joe earlier,

463
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,976
we implemented in such a way that they

464
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,998
retained an organic feel through variation in the layering.

465
00:48:59,658 --> 00:49:01,319
Basically, this meant that the songs

466
00:49:01,379 --> 00:49:03,360
would transition to instrumental arrangements

467
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,801
in between sections if the player hung around

468
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:07,362
in a particular area for too long.

469
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:12,467
For example, ensuring that verses and choruses never repeated unnaturally.

470
00:49:14,029 --> 00:49:17,612
We also made heavy use of WISER's entry and exit cues to ensure the

471
00:49:17,652 --> 00:49:19,514
transitions themselves felt natural.

472
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:24,238
For example, when the vocals would lead into a chorus or drums could feature

473
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,780
preceding fills or succeeding crash tails.

474
00:49:29,588 --> 00:49:35,651
Thanks Jay. So you'd seen earlier how we went about selecting the songs throughout the rest

475
00:49:35,691 --> 00:49:41,053
of the game but these were a specific set of songs that had their own challenges and finding

476
00:49:41,073 --> 00:49:45,274
the songs for them was going to be tricky. So we needed them to be internationally recognizable,

477
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:51,577
that was pretty much a given. But we also needed them to have a set rhythm that continued

478
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:54,098
throughout the song because the level designers

479
00:49:54,746 --> 00:49:57,227
Full credit to them, made some fantastic levels,

480
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:59,328
but having that set beat throughout

481
00:49:59,408 --> 00:50:01,129
gave them something to build to.

482
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,111
As such, they also needed a standard structure,

483
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:07,091
so you couldn't really have a nine-minute epic,

484
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:10,533
prog, kind of solo or anything like that.

485
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:14,355
It needed something where the level designers

486
00:50:14,755 --> 00:50:17,996
could very, very, you know, go in, construct something,

487
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,097
test things out, make sure it worked.

488
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:24,299
As such, you also needed a tempo within certain limits.

489
00:50:25,086 --> 00:50:32,567
If it was too slow, the level really wouldn't stand out as doing anything too fast, and it's going to be very, very chaotic.

490
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:43,029
And as we mentioned, we didn't want it to feel on rails, but we did try and look for moments where the song could be choreographed slightly more than it is elsewhere.

491
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,870
And bridges and transitions were the perfect places where this could happen.

492
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:53,512
So we were always on the lookout for interesting bridges and transitions where you could see something.

493
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,652
choreographing and syncing up to the song at those moments.

494
00:50:57,993 --> 00:51:01,615
As with every other song in the game, they needed usable stems, and this was

495
00:51:01,815 --> 00:51:04,937
often a hurdle for some of the older catalog. And as

496
00:51:04,977 --> 00:51:08,979
Jay mentioned, these are the songs complete with vocals, and for a family

497
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,261
friendly game, we needed them to be lyrically suitable for the rating.

498
00:51:12,662 --> 00:51:15,924
You'd think most songs out there would work,

499
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:20,026
but there are plenty out there actually that would either require an edit

500
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:23,748
or just couldn't work or get past the rating that we required.

501
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:30,397
Even down to level design, there were criteria and they actually had a ratings chart where they would

502
00:51:30,437 --> 00:51:36,841
rate the song based on things like progression or a steady beat or even the fact that a lyrical phrase

503
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:41,504
moved across sections. If that happens, it was very tricky to make it implement without

504
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:48,948
kind of making the song sound like a poor edit or just it not working at all. And then finally,

505
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:53,731
we needed the songs to be approved and you could get the perfect song and then find that

506
00:51:54,534 --> 00:51:58,196
it wasn't going to be in budget or the artist wasn't keen on doing it.

507
00:51:58,456 --> 00:52:03,659
So that was the final hurdle, but while there were challenges there were also rewards.

508
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:05,100
So we'll have a look at those here.

509
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:11,063
So we know that with the challenges we had these very specific set of conditions.

510
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:17,386
We also knew that it was a possibility that the levels could become too busy or distracting.

511
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:21,863
Making a synchronized level, and full credit to the level creation teams,

512
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:29,187
they did strike a balance between these beautiful, very, very choreographed levels

513
00:52:30,088 --> 00:52:34,050
without making it too busy so you can't see the player character.

514
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:39,493
As mentioned, we did have the whole question between player freedom and choreography,

515
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:44,116
as Jay wanted, and we agreed. We didn't want these levels to be on rails,

516
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:46,017
so we wanted to give the player freedom.

517
00:52:46,857 --> 00:52:49,519
But that came at the expense occasionally of choreography,

518
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,482
so it was great that we could strike a balance where the songs did both.

519
00:52:53,683 --> 00:52:57,226
We also within the team didn't want it to distract too much

520
00:52:57,266 --> 00:52:58,467
from the other music in the game.

521
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:04,452
We refer to them as music levels, but for us, every level in the game is musical.

522
00:53:05,152 --> 00:53:07,654
And while these are definitely standout moments,

523
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:11,398
we didn't want these particular songs to make the rest look

524
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:14,640
like they weren't implemented as quite as curated.

525
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:20,540
And as with any licensed music, there are limitations around promotion and streaming.

526
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:27,825
However, there were great rewards for this. These are some of the most standout moments

527
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:32,688
within the game. Often, you know, these are the levels that players will mention

528
00:53:32,748 --> 00:53:33,749
when you ask about the game.

529
00:53:34,529 --> 00:53:39,973
We had the potential to also use actual master recordings and bring a new lease of life to

530
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:41,495
songs that have been everywhere.

531
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:47,479
And this was something that we saw a real benefit for, both for us and for the licensors

532
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:51,943
too, whereby these are songs that you'll hear on the radio, they've been used in adverts,

533
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,124
they've been used in films.

534
00:53:53,704 --> 00:53:57,725
But now there are definitely people out there who are starting to really see,

535
00:53:58,326 --> 00:54:02,887
you know, Sackboy, the game as a place where they know these songs from.

536
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:08,729
And bringing new life to catalogue and legacy hits is something absolutely fantastic.

537
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:12,670
They were definitely the combination of our learnings across the game as well,

538
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:16,752
not only in terms of music implementation and licensing,

539
00:54:16,772 --> 00:54:20,433
but also in combination with art design and level creation.

540
00:54:21,876 --> 00:54:27,100
We knew that while they're not necessarily emotional in terms of sadness or you know

541
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:33,285
narrative beats, they are emotional peaks of the game. Players very often describe euphoric moods

542
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:36,767
when playing through these levels and you'll always see people with a smile on their face

543
00:54:36,787 --> 00:54:42,272
as they play through. Fundamentally they were also something musically new for a franchise

544
00:54:42,632 --> 00:54:44,553
that is known already for its music.

545
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,269
And this was an absolute thing that we wanted to achieve with this game, where

546
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:55,031
we did something different, we did something unexpected. And that feeds into one of the

547
00:54:55,091 --> 00:55:00,172
final rewards, which was the crystallization of what we described as the surprise ethos.

548
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:02,493
These are well-known songs and...

549
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:09,647
Hearing them elsewhere maybe isn't a surprise, but we wanted it to be a surprise for people

550
00:55:09,748 --> 00:55:14,790
playing the game. That could either be just simply from the inclusion of these AAA,

551
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:19,912
massive international recognizable hits, or it could be in the way that they're used.

552
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:25,715
In always eliciting a smile or a reaction, there are people who possibly

553
00:55:25,735 --> 00:55:29,276
weren't expecting these songs in the game.

554
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:35,628
Doing that, and it's something that we looked at across the rest of the game as well, the music is

555
00:55:35,648 --> 00:55:40,892
always there to delight and surprise, and so we really feel we achieved that. And so we'll show

556
00:55:40,932 --> 00:55:46,055
you a very brief clip of the first music level you encounter in the game, and I'm going to point

557
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:47,736
out a couple of bits as we go through.

558
00:55:56,997 --> 00:56:01,719
So in the starting area it's looping the intro and it's positioned in 3D on the radio.

559
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:10,121
Here's the player doing some coordinated dancing, although Sackboy can emote as a dance as well.

560
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:30,616
And the song is always naturally moving through the song.

561
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:40,285
One of the ways that level design were able to create a choreography without making the level

562
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:45,490
itself on rails is through these enemies that move in time to specific parts of the song.

563
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:09,263
And here's one of the more choreographed sections.

564
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:45,589
So in summary, we started by examining the legacy of the franchise.

565
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,112
We developed methods and processes that enabled us to innovate

566
00:57:49,172 --> 00:57:50,874
both creatively and technically.

567
00:57:51,495 --> 00:57:54,578
And we expanded the soundtrack in multiple directions

568
00:57:54,698 --> 00:57:55,999
in a bid to broaden the appeal.

569
00:57:58,302 --> 00:58:01,885
We pushed the thematic content to pull together the varied soundtrack

570
00:58:02,385 --> 00:58:07,069
and we did a deeper dive into the implementation that really allowed us to create a narrative

571
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:12,493
journey through the game, pushing into new areas but also maintaining that feeling of

572
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:17,557
the franchise that had come before. And we brought together the wildly

573
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:21,220
disparate threads of licensed music by paying attention to the level design

574
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:27,104
and working in harmony with art, level creation and our own guidelines for each of the game's worlds.

575
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:31,219
These were punctuated by high points of set piece musical moments

576
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,723
that were the most visible combination of these different game development threads.

577
00:58:36,483 --> 00:58:39,926
And surprised was at the heart of our approach to Sackboy as well.

578
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:44,229
It was a constant throughout the game designed to keep the music fresh

579
00:58:44,509 --> 00:58:46,551
and create a range of memorable moments.

580
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:52,315
This was no small feat, and it was therefore a huge collaborative effort.

581
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:56,338
So thanks to all the composers, licensors and musicians involved.

582
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,328
As well as all the awesome audio teams at Sumo Sheffield and the creative arts team.

583
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:03,232
Thanks for listening.
