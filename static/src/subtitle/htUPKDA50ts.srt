1
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:08,348
I'm Susan McKinley-Ross and I'm going to talk about epiphanies, design epiphanies from

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,369
Quirkle and other games.

3
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:13,150
The first thing I want to talk about is what is a design epiphany?

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,852
And for me a design epiphany is that glorious, joyous moment when you're working on something

5
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:23,253
and all of a sudden you understand a design concept that you didn't understand before.

6
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:26,175
For me, it usually happens when I'm trying to solve a

7
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:28,796
problem, I'm banging my head against the wall, how can I

8
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:29,476
figure this out?

9
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:32,457
And all of a sudden, I see it clearly and I understand

10
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:35,739
viscerally something that I didn't understand before.

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,360
And what I've noticed is that these design epiphanies are

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,861
applicable to future things.

13
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,602
They don't just solve the problem I'm working on, but if

14
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:46,403
I remember them, I can use them to solve future problems.

15
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:49,565
The other thing I want to do is give you a brief

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,125
introduction to Quirkle, because I'm going to be

17
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:52,046
talking about it a lot.

18
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:54,055
and you're gonna wanna know what the game is.

19
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,216
It's an abstract strategy board game.

20
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,217
It consists of 108 wooden tiles,

21
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:03,217
and you use the tiles to make lines

22
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:05,978
that are either all the same shape or all the same color.

23
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:13,497
At the beginning of the game, the decision tree is pretty small.

24
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:15,979
The scoring is very close to Scrabble.

25
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:18,760
And, for instance, if you played those two orange tiles,

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,901
you would score four points for the star line and two points for the orange line,

27
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:23,962
so you'd get six points.

28
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:25,662
And then the game goes on.

29
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:29,004
The decision tree gets more interesting. There's more choices.

30
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,625
For instance, if you played the two yellow tiles,

31
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,026
you'd score three points for the X line.

32
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:36,967
I think it's three points for the star line. I can't see from here.

33
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,502
and add two points for the yellow line.

34
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,782
So you'd get eight points.

35
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:42,443
And then at the end of the game,

36
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:45,384
there's some more interesting scoring opportunities

37
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,164
and you can make quirkles.

38
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:48,445
You can do this in the middle of the game,

39
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:49,285
but it's less likely.

40
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,367
So for instance, if you played that orange diamond

41
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:56,008
on the middle bottom.

42
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:59,550
you would make a corkle, because there's six shapes

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,233
and six colors, and you can't have any duplicates in a line.

44
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:05,774
For instance, you can't have two red squares

45
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,515
and a red line or a square line.

46
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:11,958
So when you finish a line of six, it's called a corkle,

47
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,740
and you score 12 points, six points for the tiles,

48
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,942
just like normal, and a six point bonus,

49
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,663
and 12 points is a lot in corkle.

50
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:21,165
So that's just a basic introduction to corkle,

51
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,205
and it'll be coming up a lot,

52
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,586
so I wanted you to know how you play it.

53
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:28,834
The first design epiphany I want to talk about is pay attention to inspiration.

54
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,276
And this is probably the first design epiphany any designer has.

55
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:38,019
For me, I was working at a toy company, and they put out a call for toy ideas, and I was

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,980
like, I can think of something, and I'll turn it into a toy.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,421
I was so excited.

58
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,102
I turned in 200 toy ideas.

59
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:46,143
And it really...

60
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:49,703
That's when I learned how exciting inspiration is

61
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:51,746
and how much I wanted to design products.

62
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:53,588
So I learned this very early on,

63
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:55,910
but I've learned more about it as I've gone on.

64
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,093
Because part of game design can be.

65
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,814
really boring and kind of tedious.

66
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,295
In the later part of game design,

67
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:06,876
you're playing a game over and over and over again

68
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,658
because you're trying to solve a little bit of a problem

69
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,698
and make it smooth, completely smooth.

70
00:03:12,339 --> 00:03:15,300
And so what happens is when you have that inspiration,

71
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,301
when you have that moment of, oh, this is a good idea,

72
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,582
I can't think about anything else,

73
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,003
I wanna try this, I wanna try that,

74
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:23,524
I wanna get it down on paper, get it down on paper,

75
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,685
work on it as soon as you can, work on that prototype,

76
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:27,625
make it as soon as you can,

77
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:32,849
That inspiration can carry you really far in the game design process.

78
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,950
And the farther you go when you're inspired,

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,313
the less far you have to go when it's kind of tedious and boring.

80
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:40,474
So knowing that...

81
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,621
When I had the inspiration for Quirk Hole,

82
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,222
I was able to get up that morning

83
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,823
and make the first paper prototype.

84
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:50,566
So my friends, Jessica Barnett and Dave Grossman,

85
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,728
are both really good Scrabble players.

86
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,589
I'm not a good Scrabble player,

87
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,290
but they were at our house playing a game

88
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,131
and I was watching them

89
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,012
just for the joy of watching their game.

90
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,295
And I realized what I love about Scrabble

91
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,096
is when you make two words at once,

92
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:05,878
when you're playing in two different directions.

93
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:08,198
And this of course was happening a lot

94
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:09,498
because they're really good Scrabble players.

95
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,399
And then a couple nights later,

96
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,321
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision in my dream

97
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,422
of basically a finished Scrabble board.

98
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:18,383
I mean a crickle board.

99
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:21,344
And I saw something like this and I got up and I said,

100
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:23,265
I'm gonna go make that right now

101
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,806
because I knew the value of inspiration.

102
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:25,706
I knew I'd seen this.

103
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,987
I knew I wanted to work on it right away.

104
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:30,789
I knew that the sooner I got it made,

105
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,750
the more likely it would be like the thing that inspired me.

106
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:36,794
So this is the very first corkle prototype.

107
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,175
Obviously it changed and evolved from that.

108
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,556
But that was the one I made that morning

109
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:42,957
when I had the inspiration.

110
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,978
Another game that happened,

111
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,979
that moved really far along because of inspiration

112
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,220
is Surplexed.

113
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:55,841
So I was working on a game and I could not

114
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,901
figure out the scoring.

115
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:58,983
I still haven't figured out the scoring.

116
00:04:59,043 --> 00:04:59,903
It's a fun game.

117
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,744
I should play it with some more people

118
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:02,565
because it's a good game,

119
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:04,166
but I could not figure out the scoring.

120
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:06,067
No matter what I tried, it just didn't work.

121
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,909
And so I was thinking about this and thinking about this

122
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:09,950
and thinking about this,

123
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,651
and I decided I'm gonna take a nap

124
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:15,253
because I work at home and I get to take a nap.

125
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,775
So I took a nap and I woke up and I was lying there

126
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:20,416
in that kind of sleepy, groggy state.

127
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,717
And the idea for Surplexed came to me.

128
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,941
And Surplexed is really, really simple scoring.

129
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:31,684
All you score are circles that are one solid color.

130
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:33,308
That's it.

131
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,270
The scoring is intuitive.

132
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,171
And I really think my brain got sick

133
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,732
of thinking of the other scoring problem

134
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,093
and said, here's another game,

135
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,854
just get over that scoring issue.

136
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,696
So I had the idea for this,

137
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,758
I got up and made the first prototype that evening,

138
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:48,779
made it out of paper, started playing it,

139
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,180
and it changed in Evolve too,

140
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,482
but I got really far along in the design

141
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,683
because I acted on the inspiration when I had it.

142
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:57,465
The next design epiphany I wanna talk about

143
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,548
is being stuck as part of the process.

144
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:01,528
Darn it.

145
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,263
My husband and I were working on the Quirkle app.

146
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:06,705
We weren't developing it.

147
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,688
MFV did a really nice job on it,

148
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,831
but we were playing it and giving feedback.

149
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:15,993
And I got up one morning and pulled out my iPad to start working on it, and it didn't work.

150
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,838
Everything was broken. It wouldn't play. Nothing, nothing worked.

151
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:25,823
And I was freaking out because I was like, it worked yesterday. Everything made sense yesterday.

152
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:30,367
And my husband got up and he looked at me and he said, well, you know, it's part of the process.

153
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:33,851
Everything breaks, and then it gets fixed, and it works again.

154
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:40,015
And this was an epiphany for me because I'd spent most of my career working alone and

155
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:44,918
even though many of my games broke in the middle, I hadn't realized it was part of the process.

156
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,822
And when Chris said it, he had been working in the video game industry for 14 years before I

157
00:06:49,862 --> 00:06:55,065
hired him away to do board games. And when he said it and I realized whole teams of people would get

158
00:06:55,085 --> 00:07:00,008
in the situation where they got stuck and their game got broken and then it worked again.

159
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,001
It really helped me be calm about what happened.

160
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,903
And it actually, the next day, everything worked perfectly.

161
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:09,246
And it's helped me in future game design since then

162
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:11,327
to realize that it's just part of the process.

163
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,070
You reach a point where everything seems impossible

164
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,013
and that happens and you keep going and you keep trying

165
00:07:18,193 --> 00:07:19,474
and eventually you find a solution.

166
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:20,715
Hopefully an epiphany.

167
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,257
The next one I wanna talk about.

168
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,074
Add more bingos.

169
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,616
So this one, we have a monthly game night

170
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:30,657
that we've hosted since 1998,

171
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:34,319
and we had friends over who were playing.

172
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,481
They were very gracious early playtesters of Quirkle,

173
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,663
and they were playing the early version there

174
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:43,085
shown with eight shapes and eight colors

175
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,466
and two of each tile.

176
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,628
And my friend Andrew Kirmsey played it,

177
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:50,090
and he said, it's a good game, it's kind of interesting,

178
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,471
but it needs more bingos.

179
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:55,014
And I just thought, oh, that's so smart.

180
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,034
It needs more bingos.

181
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:58,595
You need more minor victories.

182
00:07:58,635 --> 00:07:59,955
You need more personal victories.

183
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,436
You need more moments of, oh, I made a good play.

184
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:04,757
And so I thought about it and thought about it.

185
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,797
And eventually what happened is Quirkle evolved

186
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:09,858
into six shapes, six colors, three of each tile.

187
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,540
And that definitely increases your opportunities

188
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,320
for bingos, or in this case, Quirkles,

189
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,161
because it was much easier to score a line of six

190
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:19,382
than to score a line of eight.

191
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:20,902
And there were three of each tile.

192
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:27,206
So doing that, ever since then, I've thought about the games I've designed and tried to add more bingos to them.

193
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:33,090
Because I've played games, and I realize that there's lots of times where there's a small victory in a game.

194
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,372
You get a Yahtzee, you get a bingo in Scrabble, you get a Quirkle.

195
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:39,995
Something like that happens, and it makes you feel good about the game.

196
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:46,319
And you may not win the game, but at least you have that moment of victory when you get that small little goal met.

197
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,362
And so I've been trying to add more bingos to my games ever since the beginning.

198
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:53,104
This is Skipity.

199
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:57,590
So Skipity is basically my version of Checkers,

200
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,014
but in Checkers, it takes a while before you

201
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,155
start to get to make jumps.

202
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:03,598
And in this one, you're making jumps from the very first turn

203
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:04,419
and every turn.

204
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,243
There's double jumps, triple jumps, quadruple jumps.

205
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,306
And each of those are a little bit of a bingo.

206
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:12,008
And then you're trying to collect sets,

207
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:13,648
one piece of each color.

208
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:15,469
When you have a set, there's a bingo.

209
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,270
The person with the most sets at the end of the game wins.

210
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,972
And so Skippity is kind of my version of checkers

211
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:22,372
with more bingos.

212
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:31,098
When Quirkle won the Spiel des Jars, the German publisher asked me to come up with an expansion for Quirkle.

213
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,518
And it took a really long time to figure out what that was going to be.

214
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:38,359
This is the first expansion that came out for Quirkle, and it's a set of boards.

215
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,660
They're double-sided. I'm just going to talk about one side.

216
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,301
So I was working on an expansion for Quirkle, and I wanted to add more bingos to Quirkle.

217
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:50,462
And so Quirkle Select has little spaces on the board,

218
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:53,403
and you put the little wooden star tokens on the board.

219
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,930
And when you get to a spot that has a select token, you get

220
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,092
to take the select token from the board and add it to your

221
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,554
hand, and then on any future turn, you can spend the token

222
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,815
and take a piece off the board and add it to your hand.

223
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:09,057
So if you need a red square to finish a quirkle, you just

224
00:10:09,097 --> 00:10:09,958
take it off the board.

225
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,700
So there's a bingo of when you get the select token, the

226
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,421
bingo of when you use it, and usually there's more quirkles

227
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,703
in a select game because there's more opportunities

228
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:19,644
because of the select tokens.

229
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:23,426
So those are all cases for me where adding more bingos was

230
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:23,706
really.

231
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,691
important to my game design.

232
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:31,076
Write the rules early and often.

233
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,478
Oh, I wish I'd learned this earlier.

234
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,920
I was working on Quirkle Cards.

235
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,562
Quirkle Cards was a tough nut for me to crack.

236
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,285
I took a lot of time to figure out a fun game there.

237
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,485
And what I normally do in my playtesting process

238
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,385
is I play a game a lot against myself,

239
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:48,206
and then I take it to playtesters and get their response,

240
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:49,966
and then I go back and revise it,

241
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,427
and then I take it to playtesters and get their response,

242
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:54,147
and then I go back and revise it, and it's a lot of that,

243
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,288
and I normally don't write the instructions to the end,

244
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,568
because it always seemed like a waste of time to me

245
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,789
to put them down when they're just gonna be

246
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,649
changing, changing, changing, changing.

247
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,990
So I would just give the playtesters verbal rules.

248
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,972
And so I was working on Quirkle Cards,

249
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,193
and I was playtesting with my husband, Chris.

250
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:15,015
And he said, please, please, can you give me some written rules?

251
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:16,315
And I said, why?

252
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:18,576
And he said, I played so many different versions

253
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,897
of this game, Quirkle Cards, I can't

254
00:11:20,977 --> 00:11:23,138
remember what the rules are when you tell me any more.

255
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,359
Can you just write them down so I can see them?

256
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,599
And I said, sure, that's no big deal.

257
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,180
And I sat down to write them, and I immediately

258
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,681
realized how powerful it was.

259
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:34,062
Because as I was writing them, I was like, oh, that's

260
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,603
really hard to explain.

261
00:11:36,877 --> 00:11:40,699
If it's this hard to explain in writing, it doesn't make sense for one of my games.

262
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:42,820
It's too complex a rule.

263
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,362
And I realized from that point on that when I was writing the rules early and I was writing

264
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:52,064
them often, it helped me with the game design, it helped me figure out how to smooth things

265
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:53,905
out and how to make the games...

266
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,125
clearer from the very beginning.

267
00:11:57,205 --> 00:12:00,607
And then the other part is writing game rules is hard.

268
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:03,969
You have to strike this balance between being very clear

269
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:08,871
about 90% of the cases and being very legal about the 10%

270
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:10,172
of outlier cases.

271
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:13,033
And it's almost this balance between clear language

272
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,054
and very legal language and figuring it out.

273
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:17,195
And when I started writing my rules early

274
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:20,416
and keeping drafts of them and writing them over and over

275
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:22,077
in the design process, I was able to do that.

276
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:25,742
I found that the language got better and better each time.

277
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:30,088
When it was time to write the final rules and turn it into the publisher, it was much

278
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,630
easier because I'd done all this work.

279
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,856
So it helped both the game design and the final writing of the rules.

280
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,040
The last epiphany I want to talk about.

281
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,797
Prototypes are powerful.

282
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:46,060
I also think of this as what you show is what you get.

283
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:49,143
And my experience is probably a little different

284
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:50,084
from most designers.

285
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:53,046
Designers and publishers will both tell you

286
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,948
you don't have to have a perfect prototype

287
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,589
when you send it in, and I think that's true.

288
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,011
I think publishers are able to see a game

289
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,333
and decide if it's good, whether or not the art

290
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:02,915
and the prototype are perfect.

291
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:08,150
But I think there's real value in when you show a publisher a prototype,

292
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,133
it's as close as it can be to what you want it to be.

293
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:15,076
And the reason is that that way, when they license it,

294
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:17,538
they have the same idea in mind as you do.

295
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,420
You're agreeing on what you want the product to be,

296
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,061
and you're seeing the same thing.

297
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,103
If you give them a prototype that isn't completely thought

298
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:28,045
out and that isn't an expression of what you want,

299
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,227
then they're going to start thinking of it that way.

300
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,828
And they're going to take it a different direction.

301
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:35,910
So I want to just show some examples of products that I

302
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,113
submitted to publishers and how what I got back really

303
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,333
reflects what I showed them.

304
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,836
So this is GeoColor Cards Kit.

305
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,617
It was way before coloring was cool.

306
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:47,358
So I missed the boat on that one.

307
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,239
I was too early on the boat.

308
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:52,808
And I submitted this to a company called HearthSong,

309
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,750
and one of their core values was not

310
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,211
to spend money on packaging.

311
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:58,654
They really felt it was important to spend their money

312
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:02,197
on the product and not waste money on packaging.

313
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:03,358
That was really important to them.

314
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,008
And I submitted this coloring card kit,

315
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:10,369
and I wanted it in a hinged pencil box

316
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,391
so that it would have a use beyond just when you got it,

317
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,491
and that it would feel like a real stationary set.

318
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,992
And I didn't have a plain white box.

319
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,372
I had a pretty purple box.

320
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:23,633
So I sent it in a pretty purple box.

321
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,973
And they got it, and they said they were going to license it.

322
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,314
And they put it in a pretty purple box.

323
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:32,097
And it's only because they saw it in a pretty purple box

324
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:33,838
that I got a pretty purple box.

325
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,121
If I had sent it in a white box, I'd have a white box.

326
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:38,823
So that was really amazing to me.

327
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,865
I realized, hey, I can trick them

328
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:42,226
into giving me good packaging.

329
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:43,387
And it worked.

330
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,109
So here's another example.

331
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:48,512
This is Quirkle.

332
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:50,954
I submitted it under the name Abstrackle.

333
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:56,996
Luckily, the publisher came up with the name Quirkle, which is a much, much, much better

334
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:57,256
name.

335
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,837
But other than that, they didn't change very much.

336
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:04,419
You can see that they chose the same shapes, they chose the same colors, the tiles are

337
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,940
the same size as the ones I did.

338
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,621
They didn't change anything in the rules.

339
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,882
Luckily, they came up with a better name.

340
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:13,604
But what I showed them is what they ended up producing.

341
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,469
So there's a good argument that my games are very graphic and the art isn't that hard and that's true

342
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:26,497
I can make my own art, but this is a game that I submitted to Peaceful Kingdom

343
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,472
And they do a great job of hiring children's book

344
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,273
illustrators to add the art to the game.

345
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,656
And so I submitted this board for Hoot Owl Hoot.

346
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,157
It doesn't have any art in it.

347
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:37,098
It's purely graphic.

348
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:40,241
And they still took the form of it, and they added

349
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:41,121
beautiful art on it.

350
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:43,603
So you don't have to hire an illustrator to do all the art

351
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:44,144
for your game.

352
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:47,106
You just want to make the design really good when you

353
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,107
send it to the publisher.

354
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:50,389
And then they can layer the art on top of it.

355
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:53,832
This is Skipity.

356
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:54,793
It's a warning tail.

357
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:02,673
So, when I submitted this to Mindware, I submitted it with plastic checker pieces and this beautiful

358
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:04,555
wild board that's rainbow colored.

359
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,277
And I like lots and lots of color in my designs.

360
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,199
And so I made a really pretty board.

361
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,204
And it turns out, A, I think if I had submitted it with wooden pieces, I'd have wooden pieces.

362
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:19,048
B, it's not a great board for game play.

363
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:22,950
And the reason is people look at it and they get confused.

364
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:25,373
They think that the colors on the board mean something,

365
00:16:25,473 --> 00:16:25,974
and they don't.

366
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,295
They're just there to look pretty.

367
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,658
So it intimidates people in a way

368
00:16:29,678 --> 00:16:31,420
that they don't need to be intimidated.

369
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,863
And I submitted it to MindWare this way.

370
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:38,826
And they tried a bunch of different designs and they didn't come up with anything they liked better.

371
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,508
So they went back to my original design.

372
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:44,673
So these are mistakes that I made on the prototype that came through on the final one.

373
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:50,800
If I had it to do over again, I would do wooden checker pieces and I would do a calmer board that doesn't confuse people.

374
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,404
And I may have it to do over again. We're considering reissuing it in a different format.

375
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:58,052
Um, Color Stix.

376
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:03,382
So Color Stix is a product that Mindware had for two years

377
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:05,245
before they figured out how to manufacture it.

378
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:06,788
I made it at home with.

379
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,558
I cut the wooden sticks and I wrapped them with paper stickers.

380
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:15,043
It's a game where you're lining the sticks up to make blocks of color.

381
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,807
And they had it for two years trying to figure out how they can manufacture it.

382
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:23,452
And in the end, they found a manufacturer who would do the same thing I did in my prototype.

383
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:26,135
They had wooden sticks with stickers wrapped around them.

384
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,837
They tried a bunch of different things in between, but they came back to this.

385
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:33,017
And I think part of it is that this is what they saw at the beginning and they knew how

386
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,598
well it worked for the gameplay.

387
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:38,839
So when they tried other forms, they didn't work as nice for the gameplay.

388
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,120
They ended up having to cut the number of sticks in the game.

389
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,581
I think I originally had 60 and it went down to 42.

390
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:51,522
And that was largely because that's what they had to do to get the nice quality of components.

391
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:54,623
But it went back to the way that I had originally produced it.

392
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:57,345
And this is Surplexed.

393
00:17:57,585 --> 00:17:58,925
It's the last one I'm going to talk about.

394
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,307
This is the game that I had the idea for, and I woke up

395
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,448
and I made it right away from my nap.

396
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,991
And I thought this game would be made on chipboard tiles.

397
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,152
The publisher made chipboard tile games.

398
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,632
They also made wooden tile games,

399
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:15,893
but it's four-color printing.

400
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,093
I didn't think they'd want to do that.

401
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,311
And my husband was working on the prototype,

402
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:24,012
and it was really hard to make very nice chipboard tiles

403
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,213
that were gonna line up the way we wanted them to

404
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:26,853
for this game.

405
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,495
Just the pre-made ones weren't working very well,

406
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,015
cutting our own wasn't working at all.

407
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:34,476
And so he decided to make a wooden prototype,

408
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,377
and I said, well, they're not gonna make it out of wood,

409
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,158
but sure, that works.

410
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:40,020
And so we took it to Toy Fair and we showed it to Mindware.

411
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,202
They loved it, they took the game the way it was,

412
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,563
and they produced it in wood.

413
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,865
And if I'd shown them a chipboard prototype,

414
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,667
I wouldn't have gotten a final wooden one.

415
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,009
So it's just, I think it's really important

416
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:52,171
that when you show your game to the publishers,

417
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,293
it's as close as it can possibly be

418
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:55,514
to what you want it to be.

419
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,917
Ooh, I talked really, really fast, I'm done.

420
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:02,560
Does anybody have any questions?

421
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:22,848
So pretty much every game you've got uses not just color but a lot of different colors

422
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:30,372
together and I'm working on a board game prototype right now that uses six colors and kind of

423
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:31,993
has them in an ascending order.

424
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:35,135
One of the things I worry about as I'm working on it is that...

425
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:39,418
That's too... there's colors and there's numbers right now.

426
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,999
That's the two primary things that the players are interacting with.

427
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,641
And I'm worried that like, that's too much.

428
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:48,544
Like it feels like six colors is kind of a lot.

429
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:52,706
Do you have any experience in terms of like your own designs of like...

430
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:56,259
you know, when do people get overwhelmed,

431
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,101
you know, other than, you know, with the board

432
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:01,123
where the colors were there for aesthetic reasons

433
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:03,385
but not mechanical ones, do you have any advice

434
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:08,869
on how to use color in an effective mechanical way

435
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,671
that people don't get overwhelmed by it?

436
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:13,173
Is your game aimed at the family market

437
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,674
or more adult players?

438
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,476
I'd definitely say more adult players.

439
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,036
More adult players.

440
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:18,418
I was just gonna say that...

441
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,356
The rainbow works really, really well for the family market.

442
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:25,117
It's something that is just prevalent in kids' toys.

443
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:27,898
I don't think six colors would be overwhelming,

444
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:32,040
and I think, I have no regrets that Quirkle

445
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,800
is inappropriate for colorblind players.

446
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,421
I wish it was, but it wouldn't have sold as well.

447
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:39,182
I think it's something to pay attention to.

448
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:42,263
I'm really impressed by games that realize

449
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:45,765
that their market is gonna have gamers who are colorblind.

450
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,126
So if you can include something that makes,

451
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:50,586
helps with colorblind issues too.

452
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,647
I don't think six colors is gonna be overwhelming,

453
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:55,027
but if you can also address that in some way,

454
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:57,468
and if you're aiming for the gamers market,

455
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,808
they're more used to games that address

456
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:02,409
the colorblind issues than the family market is.

457
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:03,609
Does that help?

458
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,670
Thank you, yeah, I didn't even think about that.

459
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,470
Yeah, definitely, thank you.

460
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,551
I'm Saurabh Jain from Fun2Do Labs.

461
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:16,032
So basically, we are trying to use board games for,

462
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:21,909
teaching children and especially in country like India, I am from India, so there the

463
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:27,750
quality of government schools is pretty low. So right now we are working on some board

464
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,352
games for like, because teachers don't teach and children don't study because teachers

465
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,352
are not good and the infrastructure is not good, so we are using board games. So do you

466
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:38,553
think board games have a...

467
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,964
like can basically do what schools and teachers do,

468
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:46,946
do they have that power?

469
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,248
And the second thing is when you license that,

470
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,949
because we are not figuring,

471
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,231
we have not figured out the business model till now.

472
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:56,533
So when you license to a toy manufacturer,

473
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:59,996
so how much royalty can you expect or some other terms,

474
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:04,099
how much royalty or some other payments you can expect?

475
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:10,074
Okay, so the first question is, how can games or can games be used in education?

476
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:17,257
Can games be a, like I know games are used in education, but can they sort of, not exactly

477
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:22,880
replace schools, but can they take, be 25 or 30% of the education which is done in schools?

478
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:30,284
Like generally right now you have just Scrabble and those kind of games, but can they be a

479
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:31,665
big part of education?

480
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:36,299
I don't know how big a part of education they can be,

481
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:41,943
but I continue to be impressed by teachers using games

482
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,284
in interesting ways to teach interesting things.

483
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:48,226
And I hope you're aware of the cooperative games movement

484
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:48,907
and genre.

485
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:51,828
I think it's really interesting how that's being used

486
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:53,789
for project-based learning in schools,

487
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,791
and it's teaching children to work together

488
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,752
to solve a problem instead of just compete

489
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,493
against each other.

490
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:03,614
So there's a lot of stuff out there on different ways

491
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,455
teachers are using games in the classroom

492
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:06,975
and in after school programs.

493
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:08,876
I don't know as much about it,

494
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,556
but I'm excited when I see it happening.

495
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,677
And the other question is about,

496
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,458
when you license something, what can you expect?

497
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:17,378
Yes.

498
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:18,038
Okay.

499
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:23,600
So I went to a, I think it was a toy and game conference

500
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,261
about 15 years ago and it's obviously

501
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:28,082
a little bit out of date,

502
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,662
but the information that was given to me

503
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:32,803
is that it's very common for royalty rates

504
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:34,024
to be between three and 10%.

505
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:37,125
Now, I've never seen anything as high as 10%,

506
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:38,826
but I know it can happen.

507
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,828
And what they also said is that the most standard rate is 5%.

508
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:45,809
And that's the information I got from the conference,

509
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,911
and it's kind of, it's not that far from what I've experienced.

510
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:52,673
And that's at the wholesale price,

511
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:54,934
because most publishers are selling,

512
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:57,815
they get the wholesale amount of the money,

513
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,016
and they give you 5 or 10% of that.

514
00:23:59,056 --> 00:23:59,336
Okay. Thanks.

515
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:05,784
Hi.

516
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:06,424
Hello.

517
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,745
Quirkle is so amazing.

518
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:13,227
I love how it is so simple and just makes sense.

519
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:16,109
And I can teach it to somebody in two minutes.

520
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:21,911
So I was wondering, such a game that just fits together so

521
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,692
well, what was your iterative process on it?

522
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:28,474
What problems did you run into while you were making it?

523
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:31,435
Well, thank you.

524
00:24:31,796 --> 00:24:33,436
That's very exciting that you enjoy Quirkle.

525
00:24:33,456 --> 00:24:34,197
That almost makes my day.

526
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:38,652
The add more bingos was really, really helpful

527
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:41,914
because I had the basic gameplay of making,

528
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:43,475
playing in two lines at once.

529
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,537
Like I said, that's what I enjoy about Scrabble.

530
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,318
It took a while to figure out the shapes

531
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,499
had to be symmetrical within a square.

532
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,481
So it took a bunch of designing and then I was like,

533
00:24:53,641 --> 00:24:55,542
oh, if I sit on the other side of the table.

534
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:59,405
You know, not everything lines up, but you want to make it so that wherever you're sitting,

535
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:03,028
you're seeing the exact same thing. And whichever way you turn the tile,

536
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:08,432
you see the exact same thing so that the board would look uniform. Because on one of the earlier

537
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:12,975
slides, you probably can't get back to it, you can see that the shapes aren't symmetrical within

538
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:16,598
a square, and they can be turned topsy-turvy. Like if you used hearts or something,

539
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:20,100
it wouldn't work as well. I think...

540
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:24,713
I think figuring out what the bonuses were going to be

541
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,055
and how the ending was gonna work,

542
00:25:26,095 --> 00:25:27,636
these are all parts that I remember

543
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:29,218
being a little bit stuck on

544
00:25:29,258 --> 00:25:31,540
and then figuring out how they were gonna go together.

545
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:35,765
And ever since Quirkle, I've tried to make my games

546
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:37,727
as much as possible.

547
00:25:38,227 --> 00:25:39,308
Hopefully you learn them

548
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,751
and the rules are intuitive enough

549
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,732
that you can remember them

550
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,674
and you don't have to refer to the rules that often.

551
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:45,254
I hope.

552
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:45,975
That's what I try.

553
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:47,760
Yeah, thank you.

554
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,865
Well, one of the things I love about Quirkle is like,

555
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,048
I can play it and I don't really care about score.

556
00:25:53,489 --> 00:25:55,172
Like I've had friends, we just like sit down

557
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:57,395
and try to make a pretty thing by the rules.

558
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:58,978
That's great, thank you.

559
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,120
Hello, Susan, I'm really impressed by your talk.

560
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,121
I'm a student from NYU Game Center,

561
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:09,181
and I'm studying game design.

562
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,302
So I have a question that I agree with you

563
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:18,003
that the points in the middle of the whole design process,

564
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,164
but I have a question that

565
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:24,808
Every time I get an assignment or I want to make a game,

566
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:28,411
I always feel my brain is blank at the very beginning.

567
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,333
I have no ideas what can I do.

568
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:33,775
But if I'm working in a group

569
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:38,279
that some of the other group members give brief ideas,

570
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,322
so I can contribute to that ideas

571
00:26:41,462 --> 00:26:43,464
and develop the whole things better.

572
00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:46,367
But for myself, if I want to design something,

573
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:47,869
it's very hard to begin with.

574
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,514
So I want to ask, do you have any experience to share

575
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,818
that how you get the very beginning ideas?

576
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,482
I take a nap.

577
00:26:57,943 --> 00:26:58,103
Um...

578
00:26:59,084 --> 00:26:59,364
Okay.

579
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:01,247
Um...

580
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:07,077
There's a couple things that I've had really good luck with.

581
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:11,060
And it's exciting that one of the things that works for you

582
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,202
is collaborative design, having somebody to work with.

583
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:19,185
I think I'm more of a control freak, so I'm less good at that.

584
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:20,866
I'm more into doing it all myself.

585
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:24,569
One of the things I enjoy about design

586
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,550
is when somebody gives me parameters.

587
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,472
So it's not just a completely blank slate.

588
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:33,380
But I had a publisher ask me for a cooperative dice game.

589
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,665
And as soon as they said those three words, I was like,

590
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:36,727
oh, I know what it's going to be.

591
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:37,609
And I started working on it.

592
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:42,046
almost the minute I got off the phone with them

593
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:43,486
because I was so excited about working

594
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:44,627
on a cooperative dice game.

595
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,288
So sometimes when I'm trying to come up with something new,

596
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:51,549
it helps if I have some parameters to work with

597
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:53,550
that can help get me inspired.

598
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,330
And then it sounds like for your process,

599
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,391
talking to other people helps get you inspired.

600
00:27:57,431 --> 00:28:00,532
So just do what works for your process

601
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:01,913
and see if that can help.

602
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,413
Okay, thank you very much.

603
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:04,714
And good luck on your program.

604
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:05,414
That sounds really neat.

605
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,163
Hi, two things.

606
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,866
First, thank you for Quirkle.

607
00:28:11,887 --> 00:28:15,674
And thing number two, one of your epiphanies

608
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:17,757
was being stuck is part of the process.

609
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:18,458
Darn it.

610
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,982
Yep, wasn't sure if I was gonna say that on mic,

611
00:28:21,022 --> 00:28:21,904
but it has been said.

612
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:27,788
I was curious if you'd expound upon it, because I imagine pretty much any game designer experiences

613
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:27,988
that.

614
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,930
Often, if not, they've never experienced it.

615
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:31,850
I'm shocked.

616
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:32,611
Me too.

617
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,893
But what are things that you do when you're stuck in the process, other than recognizing

618
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,374
that it is a natural part of the evolution?

619
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:46,926
I didn't put this epiphany in there, but one of the things for me is realizing that the

620
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:52,752
most important component of game design, and probably any design, is time.

621
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:59,939
And when I'm stuck, if I just make myself do the work and play the game over and over,

622
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,681
it will suggest different things to try.

623
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,922
So I'll play it against myself, I'll be like,

624
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:07,362
I can't figure this problem out,

625
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:08,883
I can't figure this problem out.

626
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:10,683
I'm like, you have to play it anyway,

627
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,124
you just have to play it anyway.

628
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:14,204
And I'll keep playing it against myself

629
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:17,786
until my brain says, well try this, see if it works.

630
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:23,128
And so it's just the repetitive playing when you're stuck.

631
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:24,548
You know, at some point,

632
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:26,589
I do give up and take a nap.

633
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:29,469
And I never figured out the scoring on that game, ever.

634
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:30,389
It's still a good game.

635
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,130
It's still, the scoring makes no sense.

636
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,710
But usually, it's the time and making myself go back

637
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,231
to a design that isn't working that helps me push through it.

638
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:42,771
Because when I'm actually playing about it,

639
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:45,452
instead of just thinking about it and fretting about it,

640
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:50,853
I can see more solutions to try and see if any of them work out.

641
00:29:51,793 --> 00:29:52,713
So that's what works for me.

642
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:54,133
Thank you very much.

643
00:29:56,596 --> 00:30:02,441
You're one of the few designers at this point that is working almost exclusively in abstract games

644
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:09,687
As opposed to really having strong themes and thematic games and things like that. What are your thoughts? Do you think that theme is not?

645
00:30:11,148 --> 00:30:14,791
Is not necessary or it gets in the way or it's just kind of the aesthetic that you enjoy

646
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:18,200
It's definitely an aesthetic I enjoy, and I love themes.

647
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:19,762
I play a bunch of themed games.

648
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:22,143
I think themes are getting better all the time,

649
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:25,606
and particularly ever since pandemic came out,

650
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:26,406
I've been a fan of it.

651
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:27,607
I think it does an excellent job.

652
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:30,109
And there's other games that I think really,

653
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:31,990
really do a good job with theme.

654
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,832
I don't seem to do a very good job with theme,

655
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:37,254
and I have a couple themes that I'm excited about.

656
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:38,514
I have that inspiration,

657
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:40,476
and when I sit down to work on them,

658
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:42,117
I can't work from theme.

659
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:42,957
I need a mechanic.

660
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:46,300
And these themes that have come to me that I'm like,

661
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,242
oh, that would be a cool game if you got to do A, B, or C,

662
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:53,265
none of them have turned into actual games

663
00:30:53,305 --> 00:30:56,047
that I can even play with my beginning playtesters.

664
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,928
They're just things where I play them against myself

665
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:58,709
and get frustrated.

666
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:03,032
So it just seems to be that my brain thinks of them

667
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:03,912
as abstract.

668
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:06,254
And I've had some where they're

669
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:07,675
pasted on themes.

670
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:11,319
Hoot Owl Hoots has the owls on it,

671
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:12,380
and I think that works really,

672
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,281
actually that theme works really well

673
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,323
because kids like the idea of getting the owls

674
00:31:16,383 --> 00:31:18,145
back to the nest before the sun comes up.

675
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,128
But in general, my brain just seems to think

676
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:24,551
in abstract terms, and when I come up with a theme,

677
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:28,155
I wish I could make a game, it just hasn't worked so far.

678
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,396
Excellent, thank you.

679
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:35,639
Yeah, we don't have time for questions anymore, but if you would like to continue it in the

680
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:36,981
wrap-up room, you'd be more than welcome to.

681
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:37,521
Okay.
