1
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:40,234
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce Will Wright.

2
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:50,537
I'm the sim version.

3
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:54,518
Welcome to the game design keynote.

4
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:58,899
Our speaker this morning has had a remarkable career

5
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,200
sustaining his interest in simulated environments and characters.

6
00:01:03,882 --> 00:01:07,364
artistically, technically, and commercially for more than a decade.

7
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:14,488
All the more remarkable in that the genres he's chosen to work in are pretty much self-defined.

8
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:21,151
His games, or possibly their sophisticated toys, have amused and inspired millions of

9
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:26,514
players, his business partners, his fellow designers, and even the mass media.

10
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:29,235
His influence extends

11
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:35,324
from the world-building subtleties we see in modern real-time strategy games,

12
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,086
all the way to the halls of city government.

13
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:40,428
Titles like

14
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:41,709
SimCity,

15
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,070
SimAnt,

16
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,471
and The Sims

17
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,732
are not only vastly entertaining,

18
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,534
but they appear to me to be art.

19
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:50,975
And I mean that literally.

20
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,496
In the complicated,

21
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:54,758
popping, icon-rich matrix

22
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,399
of an imaginary city,

23
00:01:57,336 --> 00:02:01,979
and in the bland features of suburban life, I see a sly and witty portrait of America,

24
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:03,100
of ourselves.

25
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:09,344
Please welcome the master of what none of the rest of us can quite figure out, Will

26
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:09,584
Wright.

27
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:13,786
Thanks, Al.

28
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:24,195
Hi, everybody.

29
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:25,136
Thanks for showing up today.

30
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,237
First, I have a quick announcement.

31
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:29,138
The talk that Ken Perlin is giving

32
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,500
on character animation, which is happening right now,

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,182
will be repeated today at 2.30 in the same room.

34
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:36,743
And if you're doing anything with character animation,

35
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,405
I highly encourage you to check it out.

36
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,585
It's really cool stuff.

37
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:45,990
So today, I want to basically talk about this.

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,251
This is a quote by Jack London.

39
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,732
You can't wait for inspiration.

40
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,033
You have to go after it with a club.

41
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,957
So I want to cover a lot of the stuff that I found as a designer to be inspirational.

42
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:58,239
People, topics, subjects.

43
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:03,035
metaphors for the design process, a lot of things.

44
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,676
I'm going to get through this rather quickly.

45
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:07,897
So this is going to be somewhere between a PowerPoint slideshow

46
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,118
and a low frame rate movie.

47
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,999
So I don't really expect you to remember

48
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:12,960
a lot of what I'm saying.

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,221
Really, I just want to make some brief impressions on you,

50
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,762
maybe trigger some associations that you find

51
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:20,364
useful in your design process, or pique your interest

52
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:21,985
to explore some of these topics further.

53
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,566
So let's start with the chair.

54
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,413
Now, first I want to ask, how many people in this audience

55
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,574
have actually designed a chair?

56
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:34,037
Oh, a fair number.

57
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:35,378
That's kind of surprising.

58
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,501
Turns out a chair is a very difficult thing to design.

59
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,043
It has a lot of needs, requirements.

60
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:45,327
And excuse my gratuitous animations here.

61
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,349
I kind of discovered that feature in PowerPoint

62
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,329
and couldn't restrain myself.

63
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,230
But.

64
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:54,994
So at any rate, a chair wants to be comfortable, portable, aesthetic, strong, stable.

65
00:03:55,214 --> 00:03:59,140
All these things basically have to achieve some balance to make up a chair.

66
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,627
And it's really the designer's task to bring these things into some agreement.

67
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:14,312
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I really don't want to talk today about the design process or design methods, because there's a large body of work on that, and it mostly involves a lot of yucky flowcharts and stuff.

68
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:20,717
I'd rather keep this talk at a somewhat higher level and look at the inspirations for how we achieve these balances.

69
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:27,122
So, the first thing I want to cover is this fellow named Christopher Alexander. He's thought about this a bit in an interesting way.

70
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:33,526
He's an architect, urban planner, and to me at least, he's a design superhero.

71
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:36,962
A lot of you have probably heard of this guy.

72
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,644
He's written a couple books that I've found very influential,

73
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:43,726
Notes on the Synthesis of Form in a Pattern Language.

74
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,287
In Notes on the Synthesis of Form,

75
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,388
he contrasts the old design styles,

76
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:51,550
what he calls craftsman design, to the more

77
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,590
modern professional design.

78
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:58,371
In the old craftsman style of design, basically, improvements were made almost generation by

79
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,173
generation, incremental improvements, like this plow for instance.

80
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,955
In professional design, the designer sees themself as part of this role.

81
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:08,138
The craftsman doesn't really think of himself as a designer.

82
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:10,399
He calls this the unselfconscious design process.

83
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,661
The professional is very conscious of the designer's role.

84
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,002
And that's good and bad.

85
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:16,443
And he's tried to identify...

86
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:18,116
some issues in there.

87
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:21,078
Basically, the Craftsman seems to be

88
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,500
better at optimizing the lower levels of this.

89
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,423
The needs for this chair I've actually

90
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:27,363
built into a hierarchy here.

91
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,744
And you can actually kind of organize them.

92
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,347
So comfort, portable, aesthetic kind

93
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,588
of go into the use category, which

94
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:35,270
comes down to the function, eventually

95
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:35,970
ends up in the chair.

96
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,533
Designers tend to approach this hierarchy of design

97
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:41,094
from the top down in general.

98
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,616
And the Craftsmen tend to approach it from the bottom up.

99
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,254
And what happens sometimes in professional design areas

100
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,875
is that there's a disconnect between these two.

101
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:56,097
One example of this is this place, the Bronx Development

102
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:56,357
Center.

103
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:01,379
This is a center that was built for handicapped kids.

104
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,520
And the original spec for the center

105
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,780
called for a warm, home-like atmosphere.

106
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:12,054
It was supposed to be some place the kids would feel very comfortable in.

107
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,660
Of course, what they ended up with was this gleaming aluminum structure.

108
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,723
And what was interesting about this was a year before it opened,

109
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:25,767
the architects were just all beside themselves, heaping praise upon the building.

110
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:28,910
It won several architectural awards before anybody ever set foot in the building.

111
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:33,274
Now, a lot of the local people who were running the center were kind of in an uproar.

112
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,776
This is the interior.

113
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:41,164
They couldn't actually occupy this fully for a year because of all the safety issues.

114
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:43,367
They had to replace most of this glass with safety glass.

115
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:44,769
They had to fill in the railings.

116
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,993
These were handicapped kids, you know, remember that we're living in this.

117
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:54,531
But aside from all the criticism, the architects were still talking about what a wonderful design this was.

118
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,494
And they were basically very disconnected from their users.

119
00:06:57,894 --> 00:07:02,398
And so this is the type of thing I think Alexander was trying to point out.

120
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,202
And in some sense, we're starting to see this a little bit, I think, in the game industry.

121
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:11,287
We frequently will be designing games targeting hardcore gamers, reviewers.

122
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:15,934
when our average players want something that's maybe a little simpler, a little more approachable,

123
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,939
and we have to make sure we don't lose them in this process.

124
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:25,819
His other book, A Pattern Language, was an attempt to make a set of design rules that

125
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,581
you could apply to any design process in architecture or urban planning.

126
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:34,383
He actually would go into communities, mostly in third world countries, and study their

127
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:36,784
customs and the way they related to each other at the very low level.

128
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,104
That's the low level of this tree here.

129
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:42,586
And then come with local solutions that he would then seamlessly try to put together

130
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:43,966
into higher and higher level solutions.

131
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,307
He would eventually build a village.

132
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,531
you know, from the bottom up. And so he was really trying to find a formal process that would work

133
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:50,592
from the bottom up.

134
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:57,238
Interesting, he's kind of, in later writings, admitted to the failure of this. He thinks it's still overly structured.

135
00:07:57,598 --> 00:07:59,440
The design is more of an intuitive process than this.

136
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,643
Now, games, of course, have their own tree.

137
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:06,266
What's interesting about this tree of design is that

138
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:10,130
over on the right side here, all these leaves on the tree,

139
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,105
Any one of those can sync the entire design.

140
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:15,426
For instance, if the game doesn't install,

141
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:16,587
the installation branch fails.

142
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,227
If that fails, the function branch fails,

143
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:19,448
and the game is useless.

144
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:21,969
So the designer has to pay particular attention

145
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:23,890
to all of these, but knowing what

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,112
time to think about what branch is of vital importance.

147
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:31,474
Excuse me.

148
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:36,998
Now the tree we're dealing with actually is quite huge.

149
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,241
It could be that the tree of design

150
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,964
that we have to deal with as interactive designers

151
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:43,107
is larger than any other design task,

152
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:45,090
because we can do almost anything in our medium.

153
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:51,156
The designer in this tree is frequently surfing up and down the branches of the tree.

154
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:55,219
And it's very important that you know what branch you need to be at, what level you need to be at.

155
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,323
Sometimes, it's very important that you're way out at the end, down one of these tiny branches,

156
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,647
fixing an interface element, because in fact it's causing this whole branch to fail.

157
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,329
Other times, that's very inappropriate.

158
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:10,032
If it's something way over lateral to where you are, that's causing the real problem.

159
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:12,314
So, I think you have to kind of take a top-down approach.

160
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:15,303
and then know when to come back into it, bottom up,

161
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:16,584
and know what level of detail to pick.

162
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:20,125
This is actually the idea of the designer surfing up and down

163
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:20,485
this tree.

164
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:22,986
It's not unlike Minsky's society of mind model,

165
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:25,027
where consciousness is the agent that's

166
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,088
going through and resolving all the disputes

167
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:27,828
between the branches.

168
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,770
So this is another kind of view of what we do.

169
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,471
You frequently hear spinning the plates.

170
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:38,132
And the designer really is in this fairly intense balancing

171
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:38,332
act.

172
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:40,772
And the designer, by the way, is the top one.

173
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:42,972
The bottom one is the producer.

174
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:49,014
And most designers are kind of reluctant to admit that.

175
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:51,234
But believe me, that's usually the case.

176
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,615
The next thing I want to talk about

177
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,916
is the dynamic duo of Charles and Ray Eames.

178
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:00,376
Now, they did a huge body of design work

179
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,717
from the 40s to the 70s, a really remarkable pair.

180
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,556
Some of their best-known work is The Powers of Ten, the short film we see going from the

181
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:12,857
galaxy down to the molecule, and the Eames lounge chair.

182
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,257
But in fact, they did a huge body of design work.

183
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,439
They also designed houses, furniture, books, films, toys, consumer product, artwork, fabric,

184
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:25,400
and museum exhibits.

185
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,020
They were some of the first interactive designers.

186
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:34,238
What was interesting about their body of work is how they let ideas and inspirations flow from one subject to another.

187
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:40,484
You could clearly see things that they would learn working on furniture would flow into product design, or on architecture, into artwork.

188
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:46,390
They were actually getting a lot of crossover between their design work by working in different fields.

189
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:53,300
For instance, this chair they designed, they designed a method for bending plywood and forming it.

190
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,044
And later, when the war started, the army had them apply the same technique to building splints for injured soldiers.

191
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:04,688
Charles Eames was an avid photographer, and a lot of his photography would find its way into other work.

192
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:10,051
A lot of his photographs ended up on this thing in the lower right here, and it's a very interesting combination.

193
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:16,216
It's called the House of Cards, and it's a combination of a card deck, a construction toy, and a little art exhibit all in one.

194
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:21,409
So of course, they also made a lot of chairs.

195
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,351
Now, chairs are interesting, because it

196
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,712
seems like in the last century, chairs

197
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,474
have become kind of an icon for the design process.

198
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:32,117
A lot of famous designers have a signature chair.

199
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,438
And so when I was actually putting this slide together,

200
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,619
I started thinking, what would it

201
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,240
be like if game designers made chairs?

202
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,141
What kind of chairs would they make?

203
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,743
So I took a little side path on this.

204
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:50,148
I'm guessing that Miyamoto's chair would be something that's like almost perfect in form and function.

205
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,270
It'd probably be some really bright neon color.

206
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,914
And also, no other designer could reproduce it.

207
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:04,461
I think John Carmack's chair would probably be something rather technical.

208
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,043
You know, very tricky to build.

209
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:07,684
You know, very intricate.

210
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,847
But it's okay because he's going to give the blueprints to anybody who wants them.

211
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:20,858
I think Sid Meier's chair probably wouldn't look my much, you know, but it would be really,

212
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:21,518
really comfortable.

213
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:24,381
You know, once you got in this chair, you just wouldn't want to get out of it.

214
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:34,729
Now Peter Molyneux's chair, I think is going to be kind of unorthodox, and it's going to

215
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,752
continually try to have this twisted psychiatric relationship with me.

216
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:42,816
Now I think my chair...

217
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:46,856
would probably look a little more like a toy or something.

218
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,077
Might not be recognizable as a chair.

219
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,017
In fact, you could probably use it as construction blocks

220
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,077
and turn it into something else.

221
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,458
I suspect it would also have some interesting failure

222
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:56,899
states, like when you tried to lean back in it.

223
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,360
But I've actually found as a designer,

224
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,640
it's actually very useful to go off and design

225
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,941
other things beside games.

226
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,301
It's amazing how many times ideas

227
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,202
are sparked by going and designing something out

228
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,802
of matter instead of out of just bits.

229
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:14,857
Something that my daughter and I have done for many years is build these combat robots.

230
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:19,360
And it's interesting because we try to build a new robot every year.

231
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,961
This is like for Robot Wars and Battle Bots.

232
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:25,684
And it's interesting to try and mentor her through the design process.

233
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:29,506
We talk about the designs together and we try to do things that are just kind of weird.

234
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:31,668
Most of our robots always suck, but that's okay.

235
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,490
Another thing I've been experimenting with a little bit is toy design.

236
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,792
This is a construction set I've been working on for architecture.

237
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:39,753
We design little houses.

238
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:43,907
What you're actually seeing here is the box design which I did.

239
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:47,430
And this is a technique I've done with a lot of games and it's actually very useful.

240
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,133
As a designer, when you're starting out an idea and you think you have a clear idea of

241
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:54,956
what you want, it's very useful to actually build a box yourself.

242
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:56,398
Write all the ad copy.

243
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:57,258
Write the bullet points.

244
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:01,882
This helps get yourself very clear on what you're thinking of.

245
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:04,605
It helps communicate your vision to other people on the team.

246
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:06,106
But more importantly, it...

247
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,672
makes you realize that the user who might buy this game

248
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,572
is starting to build their middle model of the game

249
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,393
before they ever touch the box.

250
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,694
When they look across the store and they see this box,

251
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,635
that's the point at which they start building

252
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:20,936
a middle model of your product.

253
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,193
You know, if that model that they're running in their head is interesting enough, they'll actually go over and pick up the box and start reading the bullet points.

254
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,454
At that point, their model is getting more elaborate.

255
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:31,096
And again, the model in their head has to be interesting enough.

256
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:35,139
They have to have fun playing their own model of your game to then go and buy it.

257
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,240
So that, I think, is a very important point.

258
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,403
And it says a lot about kind of putting vision and clarity on a product.

259
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:43,545
Now, these are my design friends.

260
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,747
This is Mr. Hierarchy, Network Woman, and Landscape Boy.

261
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:51,074
They show up all over the place, at all different levels.

262
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,856
And these are topologies that, to give you an example,

263
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,217
in SimCity, we have a land use model.

264
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:00,337
And there's a definite hierarchy of buildings

265
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,158
and structures, what evolves from what.

266
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:04,559
Tech trees and other games would be an example.

267
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:07,140
Networks, of course, are pretty obvious in SimCity,

268
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,041
the road network, power lines, water.

269
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,502
And then there's the landscape, both the literal terrain

270
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,103
and all the statistical landscapes, the crime,

271
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,443
pollution maps are all landscapes.

272
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:19,164
Now, in SimCity, as in most games,

273
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:22,365
these topologies are woven through at all levels,

274
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:26,067
not only of the design itself, but the design process also.

275
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,487
So these are kind of patterns of space

276
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,509
that, as designers, we can use over and over.

277
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,109
And they help to clarify kind of, is this a hierarchy

278
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:34,970
or is this a network?

279
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,991
So there are also, besides patterns of time, of space,

280
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:39,911
there are patterns of time.

281
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:43,033
And this, I found to be the most important pattern of time

282
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:43,733
that I've come across.

283
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:44,753
And.

284
00:15:45,656 --> 00:15:51,684
I'm not really quite sure what to call this thing. I've heard it called the interaction onion, the nested feedback cycles, a lot of things.

285
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:56,730
But the idea here is that at any point in time, your player is embedded.

286
00:15:57,713 --> 00:16:01,876
in multiple cycles of increasing time of feedback.

287
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:06,019
So for instance, you know, over the next few seconds I'll be hopping, pushing the button

288
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:06,759
to hop in Mario.

289
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,742
Over the next minute or so I'm trying to get past this particular obstacle.

290
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,304
Over the next few minutes I'm trying to complete this level.

291
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:14,925
Any game can be seen this way.

292
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:21,269
Now, we need successes and failures for each level of this time cycle.

293
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:29,789
The interior cycle, success there basically buys you the ability to play at the next outer cycle.

294
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,412
So basically success is a prerequisite for you to move to the next cycle.

295
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:38,294
You have to be successful at the short-term cycles to be successful at the long-term cycles.

296
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,977
And this is important not just for the player, but especially for the designer.

297
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:46,320
Which is to say that if the first ten seconds of your game is not fun,

298
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,961
it doesn't matter how fun the ten-minute cycle is.

299
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:51,648
And so you have to make sure that you're

300
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,489
putting the right emphasis on these inner cycles.

301
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,090
The minute-to-minute experience has

302
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,451
to be really fun before you can really

303
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:58,952
start thinking about the strategy, the longer-term

304
00:16:58,972 --> 00:16:59,332
gameplay.

305
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:02,094
I think console designers get this a lot more than PC game

306
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:04,035
designers, because frequently the first thing they'll do

307
00:17:04,055 --> 00:17:06,756
is they'll spend a month working on the control structure.

308
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:07,396
How does it feel?

309
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:08,937
And that's exactly why they're doing this.

310
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,980
On the Sims, this is roughly what those cycles kind of

311
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,680
mapped out into.

312
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,281
We have the basic control structure at the bottom here.

313
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:21,959
You know, once you learn that you're successful, you can then move your character and then interact.

314
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,183
Then you go to the needs. At that point, you have all you need to go and start meeting their needs.

315
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:34,269
Now, at this level, if you fail, you know, they're going to go pee on the floor and collapse and starve and all this bad stuff.

316
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,553
But if you meet the needs, then you've bought them happiness and free time to move to the next level,

317
00:17:39,013 --> 00:17:42,496
where they can start developing skills and get a job and work on the economic side.

318
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:44,818
So, basically, you need a lot of...

319
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,562
success and failure at each stage of these time cycles.

320
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:55,785
And frequently I've found that the failure side really is more important than the success

321
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:56,065
side.

322
00:17:56,085 --> 00:18:00,467
You know, we think of failure as bad, but really failure can be quite fun if you make

323
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:01,087
it interesting.

324
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,848
I think failure is bad when it's repetitive.

325
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:08,971
It's either too often, or there's too little variety of it, or when there's inexplicable

326
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,011
failure and you have no idea why you failed.

327
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,012
But this is something I learned early on.

328
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,656
And so in The Sims, we tried to have a large variety

329
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,759
of failure states, not only in the shipping game,

330
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:22,981
but failure states that you could download.

331
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,242
We could expand the failure states

332
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:25,303
through new object behaviors.

333
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,946
Try as we might, no matter how many failure states

334
00:18:28,966 --> 00:18:31,008
we put into the game, the users discovered a lot more.

335
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,461
So hook and crook, they invented them.

336
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:38,203
Sometimes they rewrote code to get them.

337
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,524
Occasionally, they would reinterpret our bugs

338
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:41,304
as failures.

339
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:42,685
We had this one particular bug where

340
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:46,167
Sims would spontaneously burst into flames for no good reason.

341
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:46,968
And this is a bug.

342
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,629
And the users thought, this is so cool

343
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,030
to have spontaneous human combustion.

344
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:54,712
So it's nice to have the users on your side.

345
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:58,254
So they're looking forward to the failure.

346
00:18:58,274 --> 00:18:58,934
They're not dreading it.

347
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,016
So I kind of, at some point, started

348
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:03,356
calling this the Calvin factor.

349
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,903
The very first versions of SimCity I made had no disasters.

350
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:10,224
All there was was a bulldozer.

351
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:13,287
And I couldn't help but notice how, invariably, everybody

352
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,888
would eventually discover the bulldozer

353
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:16,669
and then go attack the city with it.

354
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,891
And they'd be laughing maniacally

355
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,633
while they're attacking the city with this bulldozer.

356
00:19:21,714 --> 00:19:23,215
And so then I started thinking, well,

357
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,696
maybe I should start feeding this, get it

358
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:25,277
out of their system.

359
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,679
And so that's when we started adding the disasters

360
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,319
to SimCity.

361
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,782
But really, there's this idea of subversion

362
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:33,864
that I think is deeply appealing to a lot of gamers.

363
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,686
I know it's appealing to me when I play games.

364
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,808
So I think the idea that we can engineer subversion,

365
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,330
or at least allow subversion, is great.

366
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,151
I mean, I find it in a lot of games

367
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,791
where I don't even know if they consciously did that.

368
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,912
There was a game I played a lot, Tribes.

369
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:49,853
It's a team-based shooter.

370
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:52,434
And you run around shooting all the people.

371
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,055
And at some point, I got kind of tired of playing the game.

372
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:56,536
And I started thinking, what else

373
00:19:56,556 --> 00:19:57,457
could I do in this environment?

374
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:59,838
And so then I started playing the game for about a month,

375
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,139
trying to make peace between the two sides.

376
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,101
And so I'd go over to the bad guys,

377
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,921
and I'd hide behind a hill saying, hey, don't shoot me.

378
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:07,441
I'm coming out.

379
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:08,162
I want to make peace.

380
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,962
And I'd have the repair thing, and I'd

381
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,863
come up and repair them as kind of like a token of goodwill.

382
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:15,805
And I would usually, I could get like three or four people

383
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:17,205
to agree to this of opposite sides.

384
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,266
But if you want a challenging game,

385
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:23,028
find a game with 15 testosterone-filled boys that

386
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:25,389
all have guns and try to get them to stop shooting.

387
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,430
That's an amazing challenge.

388
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,171
And it was really cool that I could play that game in this.

389
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:39,249
Toys are also really cool. Toys are like so subvertible it's great. And my daughter and I do this a lot.

390
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:46,713
Not too long ago she had a Barbie laying around and I had my Estes Rockets laying around.

391
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:52,396
So this is the type of stuff I love to do. I try to instill this in my daughter.

392
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,378
It turns out the parachute wadding sets our hair on fire though.

393
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,698
OK, let's move on to something else.

394
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:07,539
Disease.

395
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:11,600
Now frequently we talk about our games as being addictive,

396
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,161
or we talk about viral marketing.

397
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,382
I'm really hooked on this game.

398
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:16,042
I can't get over it.

399
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:19,443
And in fact, disease is actually a very useful metaphor

400
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:20,583
in a number of ways, I found.

401
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,004
One of the chief things that influences

402
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,745
how well a disease spreads are the vectors.

403
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:27,826
Who catches it from what?

404
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,971
I've tried to map out the vectors for the Sims here,

405
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,152
because I think this is one of the critical reasons

406
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,313
for its success so far.

407
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,574
Started with Computer Press, you know, getting good reviews,

408
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:39,896
which got some of the hardcore gamers to pick up the game.

409
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,897
These hardcore gamers, which were almost entirely male,

410
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,698
would buy the game, they'd play it for a while,

411
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:45,599
oh this is kind of cool.

412
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,120
But the most important vector in the whole spread here

413
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,442
was this second one, where these hardcore male gamers

414
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:54,023
were spreading it to their mostly female girlfriends

415
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:54,623
and spouses.

416
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:59,482
So in this sense, the Sims was quite similar to like a sexually transmitted disease.

417
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:03,144
But once it hit this group...

418
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:07,505
which is mostly female, the lateral spread at that point was tremendous because

419
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:11,507
a lot of these players had never played a computer game before. This is their first

420
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:14,168
computer game experience. And imagine the first time you played a computer game,

421
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,730
how cool it was and how much enthusiasm they would have for it.

422
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,232
And therefore they start telling their friends much more than the jaded, hardcore

423
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:21,572
gamer.

424
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:25,034
So then they were spreading it to their friends and family and that was where

425
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,014
the game really took off.

426
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:29,676
And of course at that point it reaches this mass where then the mainstream press...

427
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,808
starts noticing it and taking an interest, which feeds back

428
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:35,030
into this casual group of game players.

429
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,051
Now, another thing about disease is

430
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,652
it turns out to be very critical.

431
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:40,533
I was running some models.

432
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:45,095
And the amount of time that a disease is contagious

433
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:47,096
turns out to have a huge leverage

434
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:49,517
on the eventual amount of population

435
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:50,858
that you infect with that disease.

436
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,860
In this model run that I did, the only difference

437
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,962
between these two spreads was that the first disease

438
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,323
was only contagious for one week.

439
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,485
The second one was contagious for two weeks.

440
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:05,066
And if you look, the first week, I mean the first one,

441
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:07,326
only spread to about 4% of the population.

442
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,347
The second one spread to over 20% of the population.

443
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:12,908
Tremendous leverage here.

444
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:16,589
Now with most diseases also, once they're done with you,

445
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,350
you either have immunity to them or they've killed you.

446
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,831
From the disease's point of view,

447
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:22,831
it doesn't really care which.

448
00:23:24,331 --> 00:23:26,472
From an industry point of view, I think we should care.

449
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:27,752
We don't want to go killing our users.

450
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,918
In the terms of the games industry, that probably means,

451
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:33,279
you know, oh, they're burned out on games.

452
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,619
You know, I had such a bad experience with that game,

453
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:35,559
I'm not going to buy another one.

454
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,460
In fact, we want to, you know, have them still available

455
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,841
for the next game coming down the pike.

456
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,622
So we want to try not to kill the users with these things.

457
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,543
Another inspiration.

458
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,510
or a whole set of inspirations I actually

459
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,551
get from other subjects or other games I've worked on.

460
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,232
I did this game SimAnt a while back.

461
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:54,073
And ants turn out to be really fascinating

462
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:54,814
for a number of reasons.

463
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:57,795
But they communicate with these pheromones

464
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:58,916
that they drop on the ground.

465
00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:02,397
And the other ants are able to locate food or the colony

466
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:02,917
based on this.

467
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:05,038
They actually drag their abdomen along the ground

468
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:07,760
to drop these trails in a process that's, oddly enough,

469
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,180
known as anal communication.

470
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,482
But what was interesting about SimAnt

471
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:14,603
was how robust.

472
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:16,837
and fault tolerant the behavior was.

473
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,639
I was just amazed at how hard it was to kind of get them

474
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:20,219
off their tracks.

475
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,600
And if you've ever had ants in your house,

476
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,801
you've probably experienced this also.

477
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:24,842
It's an amazingly robust intelligence.

478
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:27,644
And so I started thinking, is there any way

479
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:28,645
to apply this to people?

480
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:32,007
Can we have people driven by these environmental fields,

481
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:33,768
much like the ants are driven by their pheromones?

482
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:37,550
Another idea that kind of came in and made the thing really

483
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,332
work is the idea of fitness landscape.

484
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:42,634
And this is an idea from evolutionary biology.

485
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,195
How many in this audience have heard of fitness landscapes?

486
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:47,613
Not too many.

487
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:49,754
Well, I'm going to give you a very brief introduction,

488
00:24:49,794 --> 00:24:52,256
because it actually would take a long time to fully explore this.

489
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:54,217
But the landscape you're seeing here

490
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:57,759
represents a large range of possible creatures.

491
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,341
Every spot on the landscape is a potential creature.

492
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:03,963
You can see the axes on the bottom, size and speed.

493
00:25:04,023 --> 00:25:05,964
So I can take any spot on landscape

494
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,526
and say that is a particular creature.

495
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,427
So this creature is fairly large and slow,

496
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:11,368
so we'll call that a cow.

497
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:14,605
Somewhere else in the landscape is something else entirely.

498
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:17,167
Over here, we have something that's fast and fairly small,

499
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,107
so we'll call it a squirrel.

500
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:23,612
Now, evolution can be seen as these species evolving

501
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,413
over time by hill climbing the landscape.

502
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:28,456
So the height of the peaks represents a higher fitness.

503
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,157
And it just simply means that they'll

504
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:33,060
reproduce more effectively than the ones on the lower slopes.

505
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,962
So over time, what will happen is this population

506
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:37,403
will start moving uphill.

507
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:39,665
And as it moves uphill, it's actually evolving.

508
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,046
No one animal ever moves on this landscape.

509
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,587
They're always born and die in one spot.

510
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,308
But over time, the species moves by the people

511
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:50,229
on the upside of the slope, reproducing more effectively

512
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,309
than the people on the downside.

513
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,870
And so naturally, you get these kind of clouds of motion.

514
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:55,691
So eventually, over time, what would happen

515
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:57,632
is these cows would evolve up the slope

516
00:25:58,352 --> 00:25:59,793
and turn into something like a giraffe,

517
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,613
because now they are large and fast.

518
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:04,842
Now you'll notice the giraffe right now is stuck on this local maxima,

519
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:08,848
which is a big problem depending on how you're applying these landscapes.

520
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,492
So once they're on a local peak like that, there's nowhere to go but down.

521
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:15,396
And so the giraffe will be stuck there unless the landscape changes.

522
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:20,022
So in the Sims, we built what we called a happiness landscape.

523
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:25,634
And we had objects actually building the fitness model

524
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:27,835
for the people, in fact, the happiness model.

525
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:29,715
So we have Bob here on screen.

526
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:32,635
He's hungry, mostly, a little bit bored, a little bit lonely.

527
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:36,276
But because he's mostly hungry, his landscape looks like this.

528
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:38,656
The fridge becomes the highest peak.

529
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,177
And so he's basically hill climbing.

530
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:42,697
He says that my most happiness will be achieved

531
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:43,437
going in this direction.

532
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,318
So he walks over to the fridge, gets a snack.

533
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,538
And when he does that, the peak collapses.

534
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:50,458
And this is how we avoid the local maxima problem.

535
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:52,629
Now at this point, he's been fed,

536
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:53,749
and now he's just kind of lonely.

537
00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:56,510
And because he's mainly lonely, he looks over here at Betty

538
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,370
and says, oh, social.

539
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,211
I'll go hang out with Betty.

540
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:00,051
And then he does that.

541
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:01,371
And of course, as he hangs out with Betty,

542
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:03,652
you know, gets enough of Betty, that starts to collapse.

543
00:27:03,892 --> 00:27:04,732
And now it's bored.

544
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:07,153
So this is generally the way the Sims work.

545
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:09,954
It was inspired from the SimAnt's pheromone model.

546
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:12,335
But then later, this fitness model

547
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,735
came in to solve a lot of the problems,

548
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,996
and eventually turned into this, which worked out very well

549
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:18,057
as a behavioral model.

550
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:21,588
We can also apply these landscapes

551
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:24,010
at a little bit higher level, the gameplay level.

552
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,693
This is a map of what we were considering the Sims gameplay

553
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:28,534
landscape to be.

554
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:31,596
Now this is the landscape that the player is

555
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,097
going to go over time through.

556
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,021
The heights of the mountains here represent difficulty.

557
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,523
And so the starting is at the bottom.

558
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,325
To get to the top peak, you really

559
00:27:42,345 --> 00:27:43,206
want to go right up the middle.

560
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,759
Now, over on the right side here, this represents social success, and on the left side, material.

561
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,380
Those were like the two main things we wanted the player to be balancing.

562
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,241
So frequently, when somebody would come into the game and they would start saying,

563
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,122
oh, buy more stuff, buy more stuff,

564
00:27:55,662 --> 00:27:57,903
they would actually veer off to the left here,

565
00:27:58,363 --> 00:27:59,864
and they would end up on the material peak.

566
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:02,265
Now, you'll see that if you get on top of this materialistic peak,

567
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:05,889
you actually have to drop down in fitness or in success,

568
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,671
in these terms, to get to this higher peak.

569
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,572
So you get kind of stuck on the sidetrack.

570
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,053
Same thing on the social.

571
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,294
So in some sense, we were modeling this thing

572
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:15,114
like a bowling alley.

573
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,755
And these are the gutters.

574
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,116
If you don't aim straight down the middle

575
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:19,177
and keep this right balance, you're

576
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,718
going to get stuck on one of these local maxima.

577
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,399
And that was kind of at a high level a very useful metaphor

578
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:24,480
when we were designing this game.

579
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:30,710
Another application of this metaphor is market landscapes. It's the same thing as the fitness

580
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,751
landscape except now instead of talking about fitness, we're talking about profitability.

581
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:39,733
So you can take this landscape and say that this is some arbitrary combination of business

582
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:42,454
strategies or products and then we can put companies on it.

583
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:47,483
It's the same sort of thing. These companies are going to hill climb to the highest peak.

584
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:51,770
The peaks will always be changing. So for instance, if the peak that Apple's on collapses,

585
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,055
they're going to go to the next highest peak, which in this case would be like John Deere,

586
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:57,299
and they'll go start making farm equipment or something.

587
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:03,134
These landscapes in biology and in economics

588
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:05,715
are actually much, much more elaborate than this.

589
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:07,656
I'm showing you these simple two-dimensional landscapes.

590
00:29:08,156 --> 00:29:10,177
In reality, they are thousands of dimensions,

591
00:29:10,277 --> 00:29:11,138
or millions of dimensions.

592
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:12,498
They're really, really hard to visualize.

593
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,340
So this is just kind of a very simple look

594
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,581
at what the dynamics on them are.

595
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,442
The dynamics still apply, even as they

596
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:20,782
go to higher levels of dimensions.

597
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,204
Now we go to something completely different.

598
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:25,644
Japanese gardens.

599
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:27,165
Now.

600
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,527
Japanese gardens, I've just recently come to realize,

601
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:37,010
are an incredible reservoir of design knowledge.

602
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:40,733
The amount of design density represented by a Japanese

603
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:41,834
garden is just astounding.

604
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,034
And I think there are a lot of lessons here.

605
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,856
And I can't completely verbalize all the applications

606
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:48,058
I see to our field, but this is the type of thing

607
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:50,759
that I think we should be looking towards to learn from.

608
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,442
They started out representing the.

609
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:56,628
geological diversity of Japan.

610
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,650
You see craggy mountains, coastlines, whatnot.

611
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,871
The real art of these things is how much care

612
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:06,532
goes into the design of these, but yet how

613
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,953
transparent that design is.

614
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,194
They capture the essence of nature.

615
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:12,415
It feels like you're in nature, but yet this

616
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:13,795
is a highly designed artifact.

617
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:15,996
The design submerges.

618
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,737
It becomes totally transparent to you.

619
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,058
In that sense, it's like a very good user interface.

620
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:22,341
You know, the best user interfaces

621
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,742
are the ones you spend the most time on,

622
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:25,743
but then they become invisible to the user.

623
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,283
You don't even think about them when you're using them.

624
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:30,704
At first glance, these gardens would

625
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,965
seem to be trying to model nature.

626
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:35,306
And some of the early Japanese gardens were modeling nature.

627
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:37,886
But over time, they started doing something

628
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:38,567
a little more subtle.

629
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:41,187
They were trying to model your response to nature.

630
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:43,988
They were trying to evoke the same feelings you

631
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:45,889
had when you were in nature without building

632
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:47,089
an exact replica of nature.

633
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,650
So in that sense, they were kind of

634
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,810
like impressionistic paintings.

635
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:55,030
They have the same hierarchies that we've been dealing with so far.

636
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,071
Hierarchies, networks, landscapes.

637
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:02,693
Very elaborate symbologies come together in these gardens, overlapping and intertwining

638
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:03,333
all the time.

639
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:05,334
Some of these are cultural.

640
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:07,775
Some of them are mythological.

641
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:10,957
Some of them are actually influenced from other media.

642
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:16,439
A lot of them represent kind of the aspirations of man.

643
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:19,004
And so if you learn how to read these gardens,

644
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:20,985
it actually becomes a fairly interactive experience

645
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:22,365
as you walk through and look at these symbols.

646
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:27,487
Some of the most elaborate symbols come from the rocks.

647
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:29,907
One of the older books on Japanese gardens

648
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:32,328
lists 48 rock types.

649
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:34,509
And they have really cool names, like the Absolute Control

650
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:36,369
Rock or the Never Aging Rock.

651
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,310
They have other ones that are scenic, like the Hovering Mist

652
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:39,550
Rock.

653
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:45,152
Some of them are basically there for symbolic interpretation.

654
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:47,934
Other ones are there for scenic impact,

655
00:31:48,415 --> 00:31:49,295
give you a certain feeling.

656
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:53,539
Some of the older gardens were very literal.

657
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,521
They would use these symbols to actually play,

658
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:59,203
I mean, literal, very literal, in that they would play out

659
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:01,485
poems or books in the garden.

660
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:02,986
If you knew how to read the symbols,

661
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,227
as you walked through it, you would actually

662
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:08,210
see a famous play or poem read to you

663
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,411
through these symbols in the garden.

664
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:13,330
The newer ones became more sensory based.

665
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,891
They were back to trying to replicate

666
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:19,613
the experience you have in nature through texture,

667
00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:21,614
through color, through sound.

668
00:32:22,535 --> 00:32:28,498
The things they do with space also, I think,

669
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:29,499
have a lot of application.

670
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:33,241
They're continually trying to make the space seem larger,

671
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:35,122
even though these are designed in very small spaces.

672
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,483
They do a lot of perceptual tricks.

673
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,764
Frequently, the backside of the garden

674
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:39,824
will be coming up faster.

675
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,901
on almost a curve that gives you the perception that it's

676
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:43,962
receding into infinity.

677
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,403
The paths are frequently built very crooked so that you

678
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:48,324
actually walk slower.

679
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:50,245
And it kind of warps your sense of time

680
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:51,326
as you're walking through the garden.

681
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:52,947
You feel like you've walked farther when you haven't.

682
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:57,489
They also will design keeping different planes of design

683
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:57,929
in mind.

684
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,650
There's a horizontal plane.

685
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,512
And most of the symbology for the aspects

686
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,273
of mankind in our day-to-day life

687
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:05,513
are in the horizontal plane.

688
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:07,334
The things that are more aspirational,

689
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:08,895
the more action-oriented things, are

690
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:09,836
built in the vertical plane.

691
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:13,904
They also designed through another dimension,

692
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:14,484
which is time.

693
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:17,406
They designed these gardens thinking about how

694
00:33:17,426 --> 00:33:18,707
it's going to be in each season.

695
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:22,170
A lot of the gardens will plant specific things for each season

696
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:24,712
so that every season something is in bloom.

697
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:27,074
And it's almost like a clock that you can go to,

698
00:33:27,114 --> 00:33:27,895
and it's always different.

699
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:30,877
Now, this is the point where I started thinking,

700
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:31,918
you know, I've seen this before.

701
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,400
And then all of a sudden it hit me.

702
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,102
I was thinking Zelda and Mario 64.

703
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:41,781
And a lot of Miyamoto's games, a lot of the elements I've seen in his games,

704
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,705
are so directly applicable to these gardens. And I don't think it's surprising at all, because

705
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,207
I spent a week in Kyoto with him, where he lives,

706
00:33:48,928 --> 00:33:51,911
and we spent a lot of time walking through these gardens. So I can't help but think

707
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:55,975
that a lot of the things that have gone into his games were inspired from these gardens.

708
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:58,497
Don't these look like mushrooms?

709
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:06,241
Probably the biggest lesson, I think, from these

710
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:07,603
is that of simplicity.

711
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:10,408
It's amazing how much they can do with so little.

712
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,312
There's a quote, it's one of my favorites,

713
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:16,177
that your garden is not complete until there is

714
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:17,299
nothing else you can remove.

715
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:22,654
which is actually a very good principle to apply to UI design, if nothing else.

716
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:28,239
We spend a lot more time working on our UIs, removing buttons over and over through many iterations.

717
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:33,243
We iterated the Sims interface like 11 times, and every iteration we got rid of a few buttons.

718
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:35,825
So that simplicity really pays off.

719
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,090
Probably the height of this was reached with the Zen Rock Gardens.

720
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:45,777
Now at this point, they stopped trying to imitate the outer forms of nature,

721
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:49,518
and they were trying to symbolize the inner essence of nature.

722
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:53,739
Now at this point, the garden became more of an abstract tool

723
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:58,240
for mental projection and imagination than it was a garden.

724
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,781
And so in this sense, it's actually kind of what they would call a mindscape.

725
00:35:04,642 --> 00:35:06,102
And they're still moving in that direction.

726
00:35:06,262 --> 00:35:08,383
What's interesting is that as we're taking our models...

727
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,583
trying to make them more and more detailed,

728
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:12,365
match nature closer and closer,

729
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:14,668
these gardens are actually going the opposite direction.

730
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:17,451
They started with very detailed representations of nature,

731
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,113
and they're trying to go the other way,

732
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,297
more and more abstract, trying to get down to the essence.

733
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:23,679
And basically inviting the viewer in.

734
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:27,704
to have more of a participatory experience.

735
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:29,125
I mean, they really understand, I think,

736
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:31,667
the principle of the middle model, where part of the game

737
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:32,287
is in your head.

738
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:33,988
And right now, they're trying to put more and more

739
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:34,849
of the experience in your head.

740
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:37,211
And so it's amazing how subjective viewing these things

741
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:38,131
has become over the years.

742
00:35:38,171 --> 00:35:40,953
And also, they've evolved quite a bit over the last 1,000 years

743
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:41,273
or so.

744
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:42,674
They're always changing.

745
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:43,655
And this is something that I would

746
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,157
like to think our industry will be doing 500 years from now,

747
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,539
that we will be around this long and be this open to change.

748
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:51,060
And they've been pulling in inspirations from all

749
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,241
over the place continually.

750
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,613
A really good application of a lot of these principles

751
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,995
shows up in Go, which I think is like the ultimate game.

752
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,797
You know, it's just these two simple rules,

753
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:03,739
but this huge amount of strategy evolves from it.

754
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,542
Now I want to kind of carry on a little bit more

755
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,963
and talk about abstraction and what that buys you.

756
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:13,226
How abstraction buys you imagination,

757
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,848
imagination buys you projection.

758
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,210
And projection, down the road, can buy you empathy.

759
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,258
Basically, we run our games on a two-processor system.

760
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:26,301
Processor A is the player, running this in their head.

761
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:27,782
Processor B is the computer.

762
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:33,306
Now, it used to be that our games were like the top here.

763
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:35,868
About 20% of the game was on the computer,

764
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:38,130
and about 80% was in our head as we

765
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,251
were running these simple games.

766
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,673
Now it's almost exactly the reverse.

767
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,674
Now we have these extremely detailed games,

768
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,857
and we're running about 80% of that world on the computer

769
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:47,657
and only 20% in the user's head.

770
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:51,829
Now, I'm not against these detailed worlds.

771
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:52,649
I mean, I think they're great.

772
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,631
I wonder, though, if there's some way

773
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:59,873
that we can find a way to get more use out of the user's

774
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,874
head, that imagination that used to fill

775
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:03,255
such a vital role in these games.

776
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:05,436
And so I think it's up to us to struggle

777
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:08,037
for ways to engage the user's imagination more

778
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:08,617
within the game.

779
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:13,189
I think Scott McLeod made this point brilliantly,

780
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,530
where you can choose the level of abstraction.

781
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:18,872
And in doing so, you're inviting the player to come in and say,

782
00:37:18,952 --> 00:37:20,693
OK, imagine all the details I left out.

783
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:25,335
And we found very good application of that in The Sims,

784
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:26,736
or actually before that, in toys.

785
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:27,456
You see that a lot.

786
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,418
I think they choose the levels of abstractions

787
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,299
for these toys very carefully.

788
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:33,799
And you'll notice that the toys that

789
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,260
tend to have the most long-term play value

790
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,561
tend to be the more abstract ones where the kids are

791
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,442
using their imaginations.

792
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,170
We tried to use this in The Sims.

793
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,632
We tried to keep the characters fairly low res.

794
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:46,153
And in particular, the way they talked, if you've heard them,

795
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:47,614
they talk in this kind of gibberish

796
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:49,015
and you see icons above their heads.

797
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:51,156
Because we knew that the second they started speaking

798
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:53,478
real English and you started hearing the same lines repeated

799
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,239
over and over, that the whole illusion of intelligence

800
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:56,800
would break down.

801
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,061
So instead, we fell back to abstraction.

802
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:01,342
And in doing so, everybody can't help

803
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,043
but sit there and imagine what the conversation is

804
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,024
that these people are talking about.

805
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:08,432
We're actually very good at finding patterns.

806
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,734
How many people see a picture here?

807
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:13,516
That's pretty good.

808
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:14,777
There's a dog over here.

809
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:17,579
We're even good at seeing patterns where none exist,

810
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:21,762
which from our point of view is probably the most interesting

811
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:22,383
thing to leverage.

812
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:26,206
When we can figure out ways to get the users to fill

813
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:28,588
in the blanks for us, that is just a tremendous win

814
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:29,448
on a number of levels.

815
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,309
I want to play you a quick sound clip here,

816
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,070
mainly because it's funny, but also

817
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,472
because it's an interesting example of how effectively

818
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:39,833
somebody can pull together a model.

819
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:42,175
Somebody apparently, and somebody sent me this

820
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:45,758
over the email, hooked up a bunch of Arnold Schwarzenegger

821
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,720
clips to their keyboard so they could just

822
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,241
play it like a keyboard, instantly making him say stuff.

823
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,282
And then they would call people up

824
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:54,604
and attempt to have conversations with him talking.

825
00:38:55,344 --> 00:38:55,424
OK.

826
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:58,768
Now, what's interesting is that all the ones I heard,

827
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:00,870
the other person had no clue they weren't talking to a person.

828
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,571
They were filling in the blanks so brilliantly.

829
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:04,112
So I'll just let you hear this conversation.

830
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:07,295
Good morning.

831
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:08,656
Hi.

832
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:09,217
How are you?

833
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:09,457
Is it Ken?

834
00:39:09,477 --> 00:39:09,577
Yes.

835
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:09,857
Oh, hi, Ken.

836
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:10,097
It's Angel.

837
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:10,638
Yeah.

838
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:11,378
Is it Ken T?

839
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:11,719
Is it you?

840
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:12,039
How are you?

841
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:12,179
Fine.

842
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:12,980
Did you call me yesterday?

843
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Yes.

844
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,080
Oh.

845
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,982
You know, you talk about basement by restaurant.

846
00:39:16,322 --> 00:39:16,462
Yeah.

847
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,984
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

848
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:19,585
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

849
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:21,266
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

850
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:22,127
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

851
00:39:22,147 --> 00:39:23,088
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

852
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:28,645
That's the only shelf. You know the shelf for the... we do a shelf and the table.

853
00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:29,305
Yes.

854
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:31,346
The shelf and table we put in the basement.

855
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,726
That one we live over for the cross-leave.

856
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,867
We bring it downstairs.

857
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:36,747
That's all we got. We don't have nothing.

858
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,588
And another one is a... I just bought a...

859
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:40,388
Stop whining!

860
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:41,488
Hello?

861
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:41,988
Yes.

862
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,449
That you call me. You said you want to know what's in the basement.

863
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:46,229
Stop it!

864
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:47,289
Hello?

865
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:48,089
Who are you?

866
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,090
Yes, my name's Angel.

867
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:51,685
Are this the health department?

868
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:53,085
I'm detective John Kimball.

869
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:53,786
Huh?

870
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:55,046
I'm a cop, you idiot!

871
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:58,588
No, it is a... it's a... it's a health department?

872
00:39:58,668 --> 00:39:58,969
Yeah.

873
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,390
This is Angel speaking. You called me, you want to talk to me?

874
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,911
Yeah, I'm a police officer.

875
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:04,852
Huh?

876
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,172
I'm a cop, you idiot!

877
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:07,773
Oh.

878
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,695
Who is your daddy, and what does he do?

879
00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:15,297
I don't know, you're not the KMT. You talk to me. Sorry.

880
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:17,598
First, I would like to just get to know you.

881
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,371
I want to ask you a bunch of questions.

882
00:40:21,832 --> 00:40:21,972
Yeah?

883
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:23,693
I want to have them answered immediately.

884
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:24,814
What the heck?

885
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:27,816
Who is your daddy, and what does he do?

886
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,136
I called him here.

887
00:40:29,156 --> 00:40:29,877
He called me yesterday.

888
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:30,397
Is it you?

889
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:31,038
Yes.

890
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:32,879
Oh, something I did wrong number there.

891
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,220
Probably.

892
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,280
So.

893
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:36,521
So.

894
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:36,601
So.

895
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:36,661
So.

896
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:36,741
So.

897
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:40,664
So.

898
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:40,724
So.

899
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:40,784
So.

900
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:40,864
So.

901
00:40:40,884 --> 00:40:40,924
So.

902
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:41,004
So.

903
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:41,124
So.

904
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:41,224
So.

905
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:41,344
So.

906
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:41,544
So.

907
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:41,665
So.

908
00:40:41,685 --> 00:40:41,745
So.

909
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:42,585
So.

910
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:42,645
So.

911
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:42,705
So.

912
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:42,805
So.

913
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:42,865
So.

914
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:42,925
So.

915
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:43,005
So.

916
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:43,065
So.

917
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:43,246
So.

918
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:43,306
So.

919
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:43,366
So.

920
00:40:43,386 --> 00:40:43,426
So.

921
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:43,486
So.

922
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:53,205
And we could probably build an AI that talked roughly at that level.

923
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:56,267
And it was just the key to it was she thought she was talking to a real person.

924
00:40:57,848 --> 00:41:00,269
So in fact, I really want to build an answering machine that does this now.

925
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,311
That would be so cool.

926
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:07,874
Okay, now I want to move over a little bit to stuff that we've learned from the Sims.

927
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:10,856
I want to show you a little bit about our community

928
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:13,698
and also some of the directions we're going to take it into the future.

929
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:20,201
I've looked, you know, as I've seen our community grow, I start seeing it more and more as an ecology.

930
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:25,425
You know, we have this pyramid where we have fewer and fewer people at higher and higher levels,

931
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:29,108
but they're all being supported by the levels beneath them, and they're feeding the levels above them.

932
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:30,209
And, uh...

933
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,051
Basically, I want to talk a little bit about how we grew this community.

934
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,612
You know, some of it was a lot of experimental stuff that didn't work out,

935
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:37,732
but a lot of it worked out very well.

936
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:39,892
About eight months before we shipped the game,

937
00:41:40,553 --> 00:41:41,593
we started a mailing list,

938
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:45,114
and we got our SimCity webmasters, you know, that were interested,

939
00:41:45,934 --> 00:41:49,155
involved, where weekly we would send them updates on what we were working on,

940
00:41:49,235 --> 00:41:51,075
and what features we were cutting or adding,

941
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:52,175
and they would give us feedback about it.

942
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:54,356
And we got them just totally bought into the development process.

943
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:57,137
And so, they became our first hardcore webmasters.

944
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:03,054
About four months before we shipped, we started building custom tools and actually posting

945
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:05,816
them so people could start building custom content for the game before it shipped.

946
00:42:07,016 --> 00:42:10,638
And we got a small number of people actually starting to build custom content for the game

947
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:11,899
that were going on these websites.

948
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,582
Some of the tools were this one for doing custom character skins, this one for doing

949
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:23,285
custom wallpapers and floor patterns, and for doing custom heads and head meshes.

950
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,690
Then about two months before we shipped,

951
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,751
we started doing these live webcam events.

952
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,412
And in these, we would play the game internally

953
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:34,293
and broadcast a webcam to all the players.

954
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:36,233
And they would sit there on the chat room

955
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:37,313
and tell us, oh, can they do this?

956
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:37,914
Can they do that?

957
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,834
And then we'd make them do the stuff that they were asking.

958
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:41,315
So they were kind of indirectly playing the game.

959
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,895
They were getting a good sense of what the gameplay was

960
00:42:43,996 --> 00:42:45,476
like indirectly through us.

961
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:47,697
But more importantly, they were capturing

962
00:42:47,777 --> 00:42:49,217
these thousands of images coming down

963
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:50,978
that they could then use for content on their website.

964
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:52,778
And the websites, there were so many images

965
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:54,059
that they were getting from this web stream

966
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:56,660
that all the fansites could have different screenshots.

967
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,481
And then people were coming and viewing the websites more

968
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:02,062
and more, trying to drive the web traffic before the game

969
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:02,422
released.

970
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:07,524
On release day, we roughly had about 50 fansites,

971
00:43:07,624 --> 00:43:08,565
which was remarkable.

972
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:10,845
We also had quite a bit of content

973
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:13,346
that people could download on day one on the fansites,

974
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:14,887
thousands of character skins already ready.

975
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:18,845
Now, the next step was to get the casual players involved

976
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:19,526
in this community.

977
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:22,808
So we started this weekly thing we call Sim Day on Thursdays,

978
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:26,110
where we have a download on our site for free to anybody

979
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,491
whose product registered the game.

980
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:29,832
And so we'd have new objects every week.

981
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:32,253
And the percentage of people that

982
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:34,435
came to download those objects was like over 60%

983
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,596
of all the people who bought the game.

984
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:38,677
So it was remarkable participation.

985
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:41,299
And we were also able to experiment with some ideas.

986
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,020
There was no real cheat in the game.

987
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:47,066
from within the game. So we delivered a slot machine that had a cheat. That was the first

988
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:50,449
thing they got. And a lot of people at the beginning were saying, oh, they don't get

989
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:53,972
sick. And so we made a guinea pig and they got sick. And then they didn't like it. Oh,

990
00:43:53,992 --> 00:44:00,457
they get sick now. But, so, after that, we kept releasing user tools. We have one for

991
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:06,322
doing custom paintings. A more improved one for doing custom meshes. One for doing custom

992
00:44:06,402 --> 00:44:06,743
objects.

993
00:44:08,738 --> 00:44:12,980
A year after ship, we have kind of a new strata appearing, which are the tool builders. We

994
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,802
actually have a lot of fans now building custom tools for the game, helping us. Since then,

995
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:22,284
we've also opened our story exchange, which I'll show you in a minute, and we've run contests

996
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:27,607
continually. So, these are some of the user tools. The first tool they did, of course,

997
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:31,749
was the thing that removes the blurring on the naked. That happened about one week after

998
00:44:31,789 --> 00:44:32,149
we shipped.

999
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,170
This is for doing brain surgery on them, basically,

1000
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,631
changing their personality.

1001
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:43,072
Their own character editing tools, which in some sense

1002
00:44:43,112 --> 00:44:44,052
were better than ours.

1003
00:44:45,332 --> 00:44:48,213
And then some fairly elaborate object editing tools.

1004
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:50,934
And some of these are just now being released.

1005
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:52,214
And the guy who's working on this one

1006
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,615
has been working on the thing for about a year.

1007
00:44:53,635 --> 00:44:55,775
So we have this unpaid guy out here for a year

1008
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:56,936
working on this tool for us.

1009
00:44:57,136 --> 00:44:58,256
And it's great.

1010
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:03,181
So today, this is kind of what our community looks like.

1011
00:45:04,642 --> 00:45:08,165
We've sold over 3.5 million units so far,

1012
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:10,107
a little over a year.

1013
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:13,550
What's interesting is we have about 700,000 of those people

1014
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,432
are actively out there in the fan community downloading stuff

1015
00:45:16,652 --> 00:45:17,573
or going to our website.

1016
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:20,195
So we've managed to engage a very large proportion

1017
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:20,736
of those people.

1018
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:24,159
If you get a million copies of a game out there,

1019
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:26,020
and you can just engage 1% of those people,

1020
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,818
That's 10,000 people.

1021
00:45:29,438 --> 00:45:30,979
If you can get those 10,000 people building

1022
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:32,519
cool, interesting, creative stuff for you,

1023
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,600
that's just a tremendous benefit.

1024
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,341
Now, one thing that's, I think, for The Sims, one

1025
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,682
of the most important reasons we've

1026
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:41,762
had such a huge participation in the community

1027
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:44,223
is that it's very similar to how,

1028
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:46,664
when you abstract a character, you're inviting players

1029
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:48,124
to come in and imagine what they want to.

1030
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:51,125
The Sims is the same thing at a higher level,

1031
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:54,146
where, in fact, the entire product is very neutral.

1032
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:01,686
very Hollywood themed neutral suburbia,

1033
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:05,188
but it's very easy for anybody to overlay whatever they want to on top of it.

1034
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:07,769
You can do your horror stuff in it. You can do gothic stuff.

1035
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,990
You can do superheroes. You can take it in all these different directions.

1036
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,352
And so what this does is this allows the fan community to diversify.

1037
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:19,354
Rather than having just the best fan site as the one that everybody goes to,

1038
00:46:20,254 --> 00:46:21,834
All the fan sites are different, and they can all

1039
00:46:21,854 --> 00:46:24,475
compete as peers, as opposed to competing in an arms race.

1040
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:26,576
And so I think this was of vital importance

1041
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:29,156
in the eventual community that we ended up with.

1042
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:31,137
This is another view of it.

1043
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:33,237
One of our challenges, of course,

1044
00:46:33,277 --> 00:46:35,318
is to keep getting casual players to kind of go

1045
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:37,718
through this boundary and get involved in the community.

1046
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:40,059
And the downloads have been probably

1047
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,479
the most effective tool we've had for that right now.

1048
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,380
This is a vicuña, which is a close relative of the llama.

1049
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:50,521
Yeah.

1050
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,285
Now, I want to talk about our fan sites real briefly.

1051
00:46:57,566 --> 00:47:00,228
At this point, we have over 600 fan sites.

1052
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:02,850
And a lot of them are really good.

1053
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:04,331
They're in 14 languages.

1054
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:08,034
About 90% of the content that you can download into the Sims.

1055
00:47:09,112 --> 00:47:13,174
are on these fan sites. It was fan created, which is amazing. That's a staggering number.

1056
00:47:13,874 --> 00:47:18,757
We try to spotlight these fan sites once a week. We pick a really interesting one that

1057
00:47:18,777 --> 00:47:23,819
hasn't been spotlighted before and put them up. And usually we bring their site down with

1058
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,181
the amount of traffic because we just get tremendous amounts of traffic to our site

1059
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:31,163
and everybody wants to go see the cool newest fan site. So we try to give them a lot of

1060
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:31,683
exposure.

1061
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:35,921
I'm going to give you just a brief overview of some of the fansites to give you a sense

1062
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,062
of the diversity of the community.

1063
00:47:37,683 --> 00:47:41,467
This one's called Mall of the Sims, and this one in fact is kind of an association of about

1064
00:47:41,908 --> 00:47:46,974
50 small fansites with this overlay, and it's actually like a mall with a store directory

1065
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:50,418
and all that, and there's an office where you can apply to get a slot in the store.

1066
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:53,107
This is the Sims Resource.

1067
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:54,529
This is kind of a superstore.

1068
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:55,991
This is one of our first big sites.

1069
00:47:56,892 --> 00:47:59,635
This site alone has almost 3,000 custom skins,

1070
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:03,299
1,000 furniture pieces, 5,000 walls.

1071
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,203
They even run live tech support on this site

1072
00:48:06,563 --> 00:48:08,506
in their chat room every night.

1073
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,508
So here we have a fan site that's not only

1074
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:11,790
providing content for us, but they're

1075
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,871
providing tech support for us.

1076
00:48:15,096 --> 00:48:17,357
This is kind of a Generation X site, SimFreaks.

1077
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:19,098
This is kind of where the younger crowd hangs.

1078
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:22,639
This is the Artsy site, Seven Deadly Sims.

1079
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,101
They have themed stuff for each of the Seven Deadly Sims.

1080
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:29,802
So you get a lust for the beds and whatnot.

1081
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:32,643
They also run this thing, Sims Deathmatch,

1082
00:48:33,484 --> 00:48:35,925
which is kind of a cross between the Sims and Celebrity

1083
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:37,545
Deathmatch, these little animations

1084
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:38,566
where you take your favorite sim and have

1085
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:39,566
them fight Godzilla or whatever.

1086
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:42,877
Superheroes were big.

1087
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:45,778
They were one of our first big things in the world.

1088
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,399
Horror, big.

1089
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,080
More horror.

1090
00:48:51,381 --> 00:48:54,462
Historical, more historical.

1091
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:57,443
We have gay fansites.

1092
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,204
We have retro fansites.

1093
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,206
And then we have valley girl fansites.

1094
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,147
We have university fansite, where

1095
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,148
you go to learn to play the game.

1096
00:49:08,188 --> 00:49:09,448
It's full of tutorials and whatnot.

1097
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:11,907
Of course, adult fan sites.

1098
00:49:14,689 --> 00:49:16,010
We have these little fashion boutiques,

1099
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,192
where it'll be one person who's totally into this game,

1100
00:49:18,632 --> 00:49:20,674
and they'll spend a month making one skin

1101
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,736
and have this whole unveiling ceremony when

1102
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:25,978
they show the skin in these fashion shows and stuff.

1103
00:49:26,438 --> 00:49:27,939
And some of them are actual fashion designers.

1104
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:29,340
And these are like little boutiques,

1105
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,202
and certain people just love those skins.

1106
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:33,063
And they actually have customers that come and download

1107
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:33,603
all their skins.

1108
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:35,965
We have the upscale sites.

1109
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:38,047
So this is the museum store, and they

1110
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:39,088
have the Edward Hopper collection.

1111
00:49:40,224 --> 00:49:45,206
We have lowbrow sites, tattoo parlor, tropical,

1112
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:46,327
a lot of different themes.

1113
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:50,568
This site is just for armadillos,

1114
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:51,709
if you can imagine that.

1115
00:49:53,049 --> 00:49:55,790
They have an armadillo pet, and armadillo pictures,

1116
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,351
and armadillo topiaries, and armadillo skins for your people.

1117
00:49:58,372 --> 00:49:59,352
It's just armadillos.

1118
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:05,314
This is a parody of The Onion, actually a rather good parody

1119
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:05,694
of The Onion.

1120
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:10,397
that's the Sim. And you can even send your Sim, your custom Sim in here and find out

1121
00:50:10,437 --> 00:50:17,122
if they're hot or not. And they get rated by all the other viewers. We have the Sims

1122
00:50:17,162 --> 00:50:22,406
Estate and Realtors. Now this is remarkable in how boring they made this site. I mean,

1123
00:50:22,907 --> 00:50:28,231
it's as boring as a real real estate site. And it's remarkable in that sense. I mean,

1124
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:30,873
but yet they have a lot of houses you can download here, all these different architectures

1125
00:50:30,913 --> 00:50:31,853
that are available for download.

1126
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:37,999
The fan community is so large at this point, there are about five large sites that do nothing but report on the fan community.

1127
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,381
Every day, there will be five or ten news items about cool things that have appeared on the fan sites.

1128
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:49,064
So, next thing I want to talk about a little bit is what we're currently working on with Sims Online

1129
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:52,745
and how we're going to take some of the lessons from this fan community and try to apply it to this.

1130
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:55,066
I'm going to have to speed up a little bit here.

1131
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:58,732
The Sims Online basically, it's going to feel like SimCity at the high level,

1132
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:00,414
but you'll be able to dive into the game.

1133
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:04,399
One of the key things about it is that we're going to try to make most of the content

1134
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:07,102
that's currently available on the web compatible with this game.

1135
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:10,847
So we're going to leverage that huge amount of content that the users have already created

1136
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:14,491
and the diversity, and let them use that diversity in this environment.

1137
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,594
Both at the character level, but then down also at the structure level.

1138
00:51:18,614 --> 00:51:20,275
We're not going to tell them that they have to build houses.

1139
00:51:20,895 --> 00:51:25,317
They're going to be able to build businesses, nightclubs, casinos, and we're counting on

1140
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:28,059
of course bordellos and whatever else they can imagine.

1141
00:51:28,459 --> 00:51:32,741
We're trying to design this game so that the players' real incentive is to entertain the

1142
00:51:32,761 --> 00:51:33,301
other players.

1143
00:51:34,102 --> 00:51:38,044
the biggest earnings in the game will be getting people to come to your lot and spend time there.

1144
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:41,446
So whatever it takes to attract people and entertain them to your lot

1145
00:51:42,107 --> 00:51:45,269
is what you get rewarded for. Like the fansites do right now.

1146
00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:49,391
And so this game is really more about creativity than anything else.

1147
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:54,795
Another thing that is interesting for me when I started doing multiplayer games,

1148
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:57,256
I've never done a multiplayer game, so I'm kind of like working in the dark here.

1149
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:03,066
But it seems to me like one of the most interesting things about multiplayer games are the social

1150
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:04,707
networks that develop amongst the players.

1151
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:10,032
In fact, the real game I think most people are playing is on this social topography that

1152
00:52:10,052 --> 00:52:14,136
they're slowly mapping as they get to know people and cliques and groups and guilds and

1153
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:14,476
whatnot.

1154
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:17,102
There's actually been quite a bit of work in this,

1155
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:18,362
visualizing social networks.

1156
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,403
This is a graph of a fourth grade class

1157
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:23,744
where the links indicate how strong the relationships are.

1158
00:52:24,364 --> 00:52:25,865
And you can see that the boys over here

1159
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:28,326
are triangles on the left, the girls are circles on the right.

1160
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:30,827
There's this one boy that has a crush on that girl,

1161
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,127
with a little line going across.

1162
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:33,688
These two little girls up here that

1163
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:34,588
don't play with anybody else.

1164
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,569
So it's kind of interesting how many insights

1165
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:38,249
you can get into a system by graphing it.

1166
00:52:38,949 --> 00:52:42,411
These are Costa Rican families that hang out with each other.

1167
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,371
You can graph it at higher and higher levels.

1168
00:52:45,302 --> 00:52:46,603
In The Sims Online, we're going to actually be

1169
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:48,225
building these graphs on the fly as you

1170
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,186
interact with other characters.

1171
00:52:49,926 --> 00:52:52,609
So you will be able to bring up this graph at any time

1172
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:53,230
and explore it.

1173
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,272
You can then put yourself in the middle,

1174
00:52:55,312 --> 00:52:56,493
see who your friends and enemies are,

1175
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,575
click on one of your friends, they'll move to the middle,

1176
00:52:58,935 --> 00:53:00,797
and then you can see who their friends and enemies are.

1177
00:53:00,857 --> 00:53:02,879
So this is like the six degrees of separation,

1178
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,801
but it's an interactive exploration

1179
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:06,043
of the emerging social web.

1180
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,324
And a lot of the gameplay, in fact,

1181
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:08,585
will occur on this topography.

1182
00:53:11,677 --> 00:53:13,298
Social structures will get higher, too.

1183
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:14,699
We'll have clubs and neighborhoods,

1184
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:16,199
and they will have their own relationships.

1185
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,721
And so there'll be kind of a different resolution

1186
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:21,622
on the social structures down from the individual

1187
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:23,303
up to the club and neighborhood level.

1188
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:27,685
Now I want to go back to the sims.com briefly

1189
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:29,086
and talk a little bit about that,

1190
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:31,447
because I want to move more in the direction of story.

1191
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:35,876
We have 1.7 million product registered users on our website,

1192
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:36,876
which is a remarkable number.

1193
00:53:36,896 --> 00:53:38,437
This is out of 3.5 million copies.

1194
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:41,078
We get 100,000 unique visitors per month.

1195
00:53:42,378 --> 00:53:44,479
One of the things we did in the game before we shipped it

1196
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,600
is we added this feature where people could tell a story

1197
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,140
in the game.

1198
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,681
They could take snapshots and caption them.

1199
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:51,581
And it was saved out as HTML, which

1200
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,502
they could upload to our website with like two clicks.

1201
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:54,742
It was extremely simple.

1202
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:55,583
And we were hosting all these.

1203
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:59,144
And anybody without the game can view these,

1204
00:53:59,204 --> 00:54:00,384
because they're just HTML.

1205
00:54:00,424 --> 00:54:01,345
It's JPEGs and text.

1206
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:06,526
So people started, after getting tired of playing the regular game, they started playing

1207
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:09,950
the story game, where they would build these cool stories while playing The Sims.

1208
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,794
Right now we have 18,000 of these stories uploaded.

1209
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:16,358
There's kind of a meta competition where these things are rated on our website.

1210
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,000
We're getting 100 new ones every day.

1211
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,143
So on our website, there's a thing called the Sims Exchange.

1212
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:23,344
And they're rated, and they're also

1213
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:24,685
segregated by different categories.

1214
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:27,266
You can upload it and say, this is fantasy or horror or tragedy.

1215
00:54:27,866 --> 00:54:28,846
And there's kind of a competition

1216
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,368
going on between the players to put together the best story.

1217
00:54:31,388 --> 00:54:33,428
I just want to show you some of our stories real briefly here.

1218
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:36,270
This one is Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes.

1219
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,291
So this is Bob living at home, nice guy.

1220
00:54:40,912 --> 00:54:42,752
He carved these lawn gnomes, and they love him.

1221
00:54:43,673 --> 00:54:45,394
Unfortunately, he has a heart attack one day,

1222
00:54:45,454 --> 00:54:45,974
kicks the bucket.

1223
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,981
Then his awful son, Anthony, moves in.

1224
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:51,962
And he's kind of a party animal, stays up all night,

1225
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:56,265
plays in bed, does all these things that upsets the gnomes.

1226
00:54:57,245 --> 00:54:59,186
But the most upsetting thing is that he mistreats

1227
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:00,807
the plastic flamingo on the lawn.

1228
00:55:02,948 --> 00:55:04,869
So the gnomes decide they're going to get revenge

1229
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,531
through all these different failed attempts on his life.

1230
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:10,973
We wanted to push the TV in the tub and electrocute him,

1231
00:55:11,013 --> 00:55:11,973
but she walks in the room.

1232
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:13,254
This goes on and on.

1233
00:55:13,294 --> 00:55:14,615
Most of these stories are like 50 frames.

1234
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:16,636
I'm just showing you the short version, believe me.

1235
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:20,318
Eventually, they hire a mercenary army of flamingos

1236
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,263
that come in and then jam up the door with objects

1237
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,064
and set fire to the house.

1238
00:55:29,646 --> 00:55:31,828
And then old Anthony joins them as lawn ornament.

1239
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,772
So this is pretty typical of our early stories,

1240
00:55:36,312 --> 00:55:39,155
using the in-game elements, going for humor.

1241
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:41,977
Next story I want to show you is Snowflake Lodge.

1242
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:45,184
Now, this one is kind of a, I know what you did last summer

1243
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:45,684
type of thing.

1244
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:48,106
And this one's remarkable for the amount of custom content

1245
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,107
that they managed to use.

1246
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,068
We don't have snow in the game, by the way.

1247
00:55:51,729 --> 00:55:52,950
They managed to do this.

1248
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:55,091
They built this giant snow lodge.

1249
00:55:55,171 --> 00:55:56,893
So basically, these teenage friends

1250
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,434
come to this lodge for a weekend.

1251
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:02,037
This screen, for instance, there's not a single item

1252
00:56:02,077 --> 00:56:03,438
on this screen that we ship with the game.

1253
00:56:03,978 --> 00:56:07,300
They created all the skins, all the objects, the wallpaper,

1254
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,502
the windows, the floor, everything was user created.

1255
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,042
We don't have ski lifts.

1256
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:16,946
So we don't have skiing.

1257
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:19,228
Somehow they turned The Sims into a skiing game.

1258
00:56:19,268 --> 00:56:20,689
They made custom meshes.

1259
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,672
They made custom groundscape, custom trees, and all this,

1260
00:56:23,732 --> 00:56:25,213
and made The Sims ski somehow.

1261
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:26,134
I mean, it just blows my mind.

1262
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:31,327
So, but basically the story here is that her dead lover appears to her in the night, one

1263
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:32,588
of the people who showed up at the lodge.

1264
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:34,028
She meets him in the forest.

1265
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,788
They decide they wanted to get married before, and so they finally get married.

1266
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:41,469
The next morning, the guy that she came with ends up dead on the lawn.

1267
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,010
They kind of panic.

1268
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,670
They don't know what to do.

1269
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:45,850
They basically bury him inside a snowman.

1270
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,451
And of course, the next day he wins the snowman contest.

1271
00:56:53,932 --> 00:56:55,632
As the sun comes out, he starts melting, you know.

1272
00:56:57,158 --> 00:57:00,481
So this is a good example of how the fans are feeding on themselves now.

1273
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:03,043
Basically, the content artists are producing enough content

1274
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:06,145
where the storytellers can now grab that and do really cool stuff with it.

1275
00:57:06,745 --> 00:57:08,407
These are the credits at the end of this story.

1276
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:11,349
They're actually writing credits as to what fansites they got what objects from.

1277
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,131
So there's this nice synergy, I think, happening.

1278
00:57:15,553 --> 00:57:16,693
Now, this next one's a little weird.

1279
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:19,716
Starbucks sucks.

1280
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:24,095
Now, what's funny is this isn't Starbucks in general sucks.

1281
00:57:24,235 --> 00:57:27,436
It's one particular Starbucks on 47th Avenue in New York sucks.

1282
00:57:29,917 --> 00:57:32,558
And this guy just goes on and on about how he has to wait in line,

1283
00:57:32,598 --> 00:57:35,719
and people answer their old cell phone right at the front of the line,

1284
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:39,101
and hold up everybody, and weird people hang out there all night,

1285
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:44,183
and homeless people come in and drink the cream, and all this stuff.

1286
00:57:44,203 --> 00:57:48,124
But then at the very end, he says, oh, by the way,

1287
00:57:48,304 --> 00:57:50,405
there's this little coffee cart down the street that doesn't suck.

1288
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:54,732
And I'm always wondering who uploaded this story,

1289
00:57:55,412 --> 00:57:57,034
if it was the guy with the coffee cart or not.

1290
00:57:58,795 --> 00:58:01,296
Okay, last thing I want to show you real quickly is technically

1291
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:04,078
the least impressive, but emotionally,

1292
00:58:04,098 --> 00:58:05,019
I think the most impressive.

1293
00:58:05,499 --> 00:58:08,161
And this was somebody's story about how their sister got

1294
00:58:08,221 --> 00:58:09,942
out of an abusive relationship, a true story.

1295
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:17,615
I won't read it to you, it's very long, but it basically describes how her sister got into this relationship, the guy who seemed okay at first, he turned into a jerk.

1296
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:25,219
He started verbally abusing her, eventually got more physical, and then how eventually she, you know, got the gets together to call the police and get him out of her life.

1297
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:32,703
But you could tell that the game was kind of this catharsis for getting this off her chest and hoping to, you know, spread the word to other people who might be in a similar situation.

1298
00:58:32,723 --> 00:58:37,266
And the fact that a game can be used for something like this is astounding to me. I mean, I really...

1299
00:58:38,192 --> 00:58:42,093
like to think that more into the future, our games can enable this type of communication.

1300
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:48,977
Now, the last thing I want to talk about here real briefly is interactive storytelling. I've

1301
00:58:48,997 --> 00:58:54,039
always been really happy in my little sandbox doing these open-ended games, these simulations,

1302
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:58,441
and I've always really avoided the idea of interactive story. But at this point, as you

1303
00:58:58,461 --> 00:59:01,923
can see, our fans are going to basically drag me into it whether I like it or not.

1304
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:05,281
So I've been thinking about this quite a bit lately,

1305
00:59:06,181 --> 00:59:07,142
how we might enable this.

1306
00:59:07,202 --> 00:59:09,704
What's happening right now is the simulation is going off

1307
00:59:09,724 --> 00:59:11,726
and doing one thing, and the fans are saying,

1308
00:59:12,066 --> 00:59:12,647
oh, to hell with that.

1309
00:59:12,687 --> 00:59:14,448
I'm going to tell my story over this direction.

1310
00:59:15,069 --> 00:59:16,890
And frequently, they're having to take these sims that just

1311
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:20,413
want to pee and eat and sit in front of the TV,

1312
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:21,294
and they're grabbing them.

1313
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:21,894
No, stand over here.

1314
00:59:21,914 --> 00:59:22,675
I need to take this shot.

1315
00:59:23,135 --> 00:59:25,417
And so they're like these little actors on strike

1316
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:27,359
that you're trying to manipulate to take the screenshots.

1317
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,161
And so what we need to do is try to get these things more

1318
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:30,741
to convergent.

1319
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:31,982
Bring them back into line.

1320
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:35,522
So we've got basically this open-ended space, you know,

1321
00:59:35,582 --> 00:59:39,025
you can go in any direction in, but it's very flat dramatically.

1322
00:59:39,565 --> 00:59:41,266
Now drama, you know, is linear,

1323
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:44,308
but it has this added dimension that we don't have.

1324
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:46,610
And so how do we get this added dimension of drama

1325
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:48,391
in our open-ended space?

1326
00:59:50,493 --> 00:59:53,015
I think really the path to this I see is not teaching the

1327
00:59:53,055 --> 00:59:56,397
computer to tell a story, but rather teaching it

1328
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:57,378
to recognize a story.

1329
00:59:58,466 --> 01:00:00,467
If when you were playing these stories out in the Sims,

1330
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:03,148
if the computer could actually get some sense of the story

1331
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:05,589
that's in your head, it could then start helping you a bit.

1332
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,912
It might at first be just a very simple thematic recognition.

1333
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:11,872
It might look at the things you've

1334
01:00:11,892 --> 01:00:13,913
bought in the Sims and the interactions you've chosen.

1335
01:00:14,413 --> 01:00:16,654
Oh, you tend to kiss a lot, and you buy this type of stuff.

1336
01:00:16,674 --> 01:00:18,355
I think you're doing sort of a romantic story.

1337
01:00:18,975 --> 01:00:21,456
Or you buy, you know, hearts, heads in jars,

1338
01:00:22,197 --> 01:00:23,677
or shackles in your dungeon.

1339
01:00:23,777 --> 01:00:25,378
And it might say, oh, that looks kind of like horror.

1340
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:26,559
And it looks at what you're doing.

1341
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,539
It might even drive events to resolve it later.

1342
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,901
If it's not quite sure if you're doing a horror or comedy,

1343
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:35,343
you might walk into a room, and then there's

1344
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,865
a chainsaw and a cream pie, and it's looking

1345
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:38,705
to see which one you pick up.

1346
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:40,927
Now, there are a number of approaches

1347
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:41,907
we can take towards this.

1348
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:43,408
One might be language parsing.

1349
01:00:44,029 --> 01:00:45,930
In language parsing, this is the way

1350
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,411
computers try to understand natural language.

1351
01:00:47,471 --> 01:00:48,572
They'll look at the string of words,

1352
01:00:49,132 --> 01:00:50,733
and from those, try to build higher and higher levels

1353
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:53,836
of features, and eventually parse it into a complete sentence.

1354
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:56,768
I suspect there might be something similar possible

1355
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:58,970
with story parsing, where you look at an event stream

1356
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,032
and look for higher and higher levels of structure

1357
01:01:01,493 --> 01:01:03,815
coming up to build, the computer can

1358
01:01:03,835 --> 01:01:04,656
build its understanding on.

1359
01:01:06,311 --> 01:01:08,232
Let's assume that, for instance, we could do this.

1360
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:10,292
If the computer could parse this story,

1361
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:11,433
then it could actually start changing

1362
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:13,433
the presentation of the story in something like The Sims.

1363
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:15,894
We could start having the camera angles change.

1364
01:01:16,014 --> 01:01:17,534
We could have the lighting change, the music.

1365
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,155
So if it thinks you're doing horror,

1366
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:20,655
the lights start to come down.

1367
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:22,016
The spooky music starts.

1368
01:01:22,056 --> 01:01:23,436
You see lightning in the background.

1369
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:26,617
The camera gets really close in, ambient sound effects,

1370
01:01:26,877 --> 01:01:27,437
all this stuff.

1371
01:01:29,743 --> 01:01:31,345
The next step would be probably for the computer

1372
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:32,646
to actually start driving the events.

1373
01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:34,488
Rather than the events being random,

1374
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:37,050
they are now events there to support your story.

1375
01:01:39,513 --> 01:01:42,796
Another way to look at this is that we have users always

1376
01:01:42,836 --> 01:01:45,399
in the game trying to find these success landscapes.

1377
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,603
If the computer can detect what goal that a user is trying

1378
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,384
to pursue in the game.

1379
01:01:51,286 --> 01:01:54,527
then perhaps, so say that a million people are playing this game every day

1380
01:01:55,307 --> 01:01:58,229
and after they play it there's some fitness test. It can measure how long you've played,

1381
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:02,310
maybe you scored at the end, you give it a one to ten, oh I really like that experience today.

1382
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:05,631
Then it goes back up to the server and it compares all the results.

1383
01:02:05,951 --> 01:02:10,433
So at the top level we can have the server discovering these rules of story.

1384
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:12,614
It's not like we're trying to engineer story grammar.

1385
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,955
What we're trying to do is develop a system to where we have enough information.

1386
01:02:16,787 --> 01:02:19,790
for the servers at the top end to discover this.

1387
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,192
This is very much like SETI at home.

1388
01:02:21,632 --> 01:02:24,135
We're doing a vast parallel search, except in this case,

1389
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:26,678
we really are using parallel things like SETI at home.

1390
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:31,343
So I think long term, this might really be practical.

1391
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,064
And of course, you can look at different players,

1392
01:02:33,085 --> 01:02:34,586
and they're going to want to play the games in different

1393
01:02:34,606 --> 01:02:34,886
ways.

1394
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:36,909
So a mapping that might work for me

1395
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:38,510
won't necessarily work for you.

1396
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:41,288
So at some point you'll want to classify the players.

1397
01:02:41,308 --> 01:02:43,249
It might say, oh, that's the type of player that really

1398
01:02:43,269 --> 01:02:44,370
enjoys the comedy experience.

1399
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:46,671
So they get this mapping, and they'll

1400
01:02:46,691 --> 01:02:48,692
be evolving a certain mapping for that group of players.

1401
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:51,234
These other players we know like to kill and torture

1402
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:52,815
their sims, and so we're going to give them

1403
01:02:52,855 --> 01:02:53,995
a completely different experience.

1404
01:02:55,056 --> 01:02:57,517
So that's about it on this.

1405
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:00,190
Oh, one more thing.

1406
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,275
Once you've done this, assuming we could do this,

1407
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:05,799
which is a big if, I know it's a very difficult target.

1408
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,303
Once you've finished this, once you've

1409
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:10,406
done the parsing, presentation, computers

1410
01:03:10,427 --> 01:03:12,270
helping you tell the story, in essence,

1411
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,171
you've made a movie at the end.

1412
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:15,002
which you can then share with your friends.

1413
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,863
Maybe you can even go back and edit the camera angles.

1414
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:18,943
Other people at the game, you should

1415
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:20,824
be able to send this movie, very much like Quake movies

1416
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,325
were doing, which was a very cool idea.

1417
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:25,785
If you have the engine, it's a very small amount of data

1418
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:26,926
I have to send you to send the movie.

1419
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:30,327
Or it could be saved out as a JPEG or an MPEG

1420
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:32,447
and given around to other people, posted on websites.

1421
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,489
So really, what I think this is going to end up being more like

1422
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:37,229
is the Truman Show.

1423
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:40,589
where you're Truman, kind of living your life out.

1424
01:03:40,869 --> 01:03:42,269
There's boundaries, but the boundaries

1425
01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:43,630
are as far away as we can make them.

1426
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,711
And the computer is back there, sitting there,

1427
01:03:45,731 --> 01:03:46,651
looking at what you're doing, saying,

1428
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:48,231
that might be dramatic.

1429
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:49,332
What if I had this happen?

1430
01:03:49,432 --> 01:03:50,812
It may be trying things on you all the time.

1431
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:54,234
The computer might be sending NPCs into your life,

1432
01:03:54,294 --> 01:03:55,934
seeing, oh, I see this love story developing.

1433
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:58,275
I better make the jealous ex-girlfriend appear

1434
01:03:58,295 --> 01:03:58,895
at the door right now.

1435
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:02,216
So always trying to keep the dramatic tension going.

1436
01:04:04,437 --> 01:04:05,858
So that's about all I have to say on that.

1437
01:04:05,978 --> 01:04:07,638
I just wanted to close with one more remark.

1438
01:04:08,193 --> 01:04:11,233
And that's that in game design over the years,

1439
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:13,854
I found that two things really have made the biggest

1440
01:04:13,914 --> 01:04:17,295
difference that I've seen in design.

1441
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:18,755
And that has to do with self-confidence

1442
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:20,395
and determination.

1443
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:24,376
A lot of times, you'll come up with a really crazy idea.

1444
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:26,916
And you'll start telling people about it.

1445
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:27,757
And they'll say, that sucks.

1446
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:28,417
That's horrible.

1447
01:04:28,597 --> 01:04:31,177
And frequently, that's not always the case.

1448
01:04:33,138 --> 01:04:34,278
I've only had two games.

1449
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:39,110
where I had that experience where most of the people I told my idea for the game, they said,

1450
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:42,510
that's a horrible idea. And those two games were SimCity and The Sims.

1451
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:47,392
All the other games I would describe to people and say, oh, sounds great, let's do it. And they

1452
01:04:47,432 --> 01:04:54,294
were all on board. They understood it. So basically, if you have an idea like that,

1453
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:59,615
and you go around telling everybody and they tell you it sucks, well, pragmatically, it probably

1454
01:04:59,635 --> 01:05:00,835
does suck. But...

1455
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:03,586
there's really a chance that it doesn't,

1456
01:05:03,606 --> 01:05:05,007
that you're actually going to jump outside the box.

1457
01:05:05,047 --> 01:05:06,208
If other people don't understand it,

1458
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:07,990
that's probably a good thing.

1459
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,192
And that's where the determination comes in.

1460
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,094
At that point, it's entirely up to you

1461
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:14,636
to have the determination to fight, kick, and scream,

1462
01:05:14,656 --> 01:05:16,297
do whatever it takes to get that idea out there.

1463
01:05:17,158 --> 01:05:20,861
And maybe, you know, maybe it'll be a success.

1464
01:05:21,582 --> 01:05:22,163
So thank you.
