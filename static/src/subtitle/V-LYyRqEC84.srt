1
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:07,651
Welcome everyone to GDC, I guess, if this is your first day.

2
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,232
Congrats on missing a day of GDC.

3
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:15,095
If you don't know who I am, I am Felix.

4
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:16,876
I am a scout for Fellow Traveler.

5
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:18,817
And my talk today is discoverability from day zero.

6
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,438
We're going to talk a little bit about discoverability

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,920
in general and what that means to me as a scout specifically.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,161
And then we're going to go into a few more details.

9
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,442
I'll do a lot of rambling, I'm sure.

10
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:30,743
And then hopefully you'll have a takeaway at the end of it.

11
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:33,953
Cool, who am I?

12
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:38,296
This slide is a lot for me to look at.

13
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:43,019
I am currently a producer on Neo Cab, Tunic, and Sable.

14
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,140
Those are all indie projects, small scale,

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,982
eight people or smaller.

16
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:51,104
And I am producer and marketing and PR

17
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:52,645
for both Fingy and Polytron.

18
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:56,906
I'm a scout for Fellow Traveler, which is a small publisher located in Australia.

19
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:03,468
We focus mainly on narrative games and narrative experiences.

20
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:08,289
I'm also a publishing consultant with Panic, with Nick Sutner, who's somewhere in the room.

21
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:09,590
I can't see any of you anymore.

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,910
There, waving. Great, there, you did it.

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,692
And they're doing Untitled Goose Game,

24
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,054
which is really lovely as well,

25
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:18,056
and it's an honor to work with Nick and Panic on that.

26
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:19,837
And previously I was on things such as

27
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,599
Towerfall Ascension and Oxenfree,

28
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,780
and I worked with Iron Galaxy

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,701
in a lot of different ways as well.

30
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,504
So, done a lot of stuff, but today we're gonna focus

31
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,007
mainly on my experience as a scout,

32
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,730
and how discoverability plays into that role,

33
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,431
and publishing in general,

34
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,693
and for developers pitching to publishers.

35
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,630
Okay, discoverability.

36
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,591
Let's start with a bit of what discoverability is.

37
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,693
And before I get to my definition even,

38
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,715
I'll say that a lot of discussion and discourse

39
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:56,918
about discoverability has been focused on post-launch,

40
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:58,279
at least in my experience.

41
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,641
We tend to put it on platforms to solve discoverability.

42
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,662
And I'll be really clear,

43
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:08,425
I could talk for much, much longer than 25 minutes.

44
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:13,367
on discoverability on platforms and saturation of market

45
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,507
and what all that looks like post-launch.

46
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:17,808
But for right now, I wanna come at this

47
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:20,689
from the perspective of a scout,

48
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,810
someone who gets to see a lot of pitches

49
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,811
before launch, obviously, and then has to determine

50
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,372
both the viability of a project to ship

51
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:32,472
and its market potential.

52
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:35,213
So what do I mean by discoverability in this context?

53
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:45,378
What is the ability of someone who knows nothing about you or your game to find out both that it even exists and

54
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:49,699
also, what is it? So discoverability is

55
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,741
this in the whole, but we're gonna break it down quite a bit in the next 20 minutes.

56
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:54,982
I can't believe I only have 20 minutes to do this.

57
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:56,322
OK.

58
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:59,545
So phases of discoverability.

59
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:03,348
Let's break it down a little bit in how

60
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:06,150
I approach the potential of discoverability in a project

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,992
when I'm looking through a deck.

62
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:13,776
This one, reach, is where I see the most push right now.

63
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,759
It can take lots of forms, but I think the most common

64
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,441
is the like.

65
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:24,744
past success or public champions with high social media presence, for example,

66
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:31,768
like you have lots of followers on Twitter or you have a big community from a previous game.

67
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:39,232
Reach is extremely useful. You should think of it as a multiplier on discoverability in general.

68
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:43,254
I think this is a big reason why a lot of developers are looking for publishers again in

69
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:44,275
2019 compared to earlier, 2011, 2012.

70
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,958
They know their reach isn't exactly what it could be,

71
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,540
and they want to hand that off to someone

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,043
who is a better multiplier.

73
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:56,823
Findability.

74
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:58,745
So it's a little trickier.

75
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,146
Findability is a little trickier.

76
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:02,488
It's the step that happens after seeing, say, a tweet.

77
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,274
of a super gorgeous game, a GIF, let's say,

78
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:11,417
but then where do I go to find out more?

79
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,501
If it's just a GIF, can I click on a profile or a link?

80
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,504
Where is that info, right?

81
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:20,327
So that's findability is the next step.

82
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:22,705
Accessibility.

83
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:26,729
Oof, this one is definitely the scariest

84
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,372
of all the points here, in my opinion.

85
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,513
I define it like this.

86
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:35,356
How much info do I need to have enough knowledge

87
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,178
to make an informed decision as to whether I like your game

88
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,220
and most importantly, whether I'm gonna buy it

89
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,241
or support it.

90
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:45,244
And for me, as a scout, it's whether we're gonna sign it,

91
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,385
right, in this context.

92
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,970
How do you know when you've informed someone

93
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,071
to the point of hooking them?

94
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,074
Have you done it within their attention span?

95
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,236
That's really big.

96
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:57,160
And is the information you've given them clear

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,822
and representative of the experience,

98
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:01,406
or at least the experience you want them to have?

99
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,748
I know that it's a little harder pre-launch

100
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:07,809
to describe a game, but we'll go into that in a second.

101
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:12,811
OK, so take these, and let's talk

102
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:16,572
about some dangerous assumptions that I see a lot.

103
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:22,314
Developers in general contacting me,

104
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,755
submitting decks, submitting pitches.

105
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:33,262
The first one is definitely the conflation of reach and discoverability.

106
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:37,967
It's super important and it applies to a lot of us,

107
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,950
whether you've made a game in the past or not.

108
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,473
Reach is just not discoverability,

109
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:46,315
and I would say it actually applies even more to us

110
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:50,679
with social media followings and previous project communities.

111
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,060
It's not to say it can't help.

112
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:57,524
So, like, if you've made a game in the past and you have a huge community, that is obviously

113
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,066
not a downside.

114
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,647
That's a huge help.

115
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:01,895
but it's not one and the same.

116
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,277
Reach is useful for pushing marketing materials

117
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:07,258
and hopefully means that you'll have people

118
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,939
who will champion your game,

119
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,640
both on the consumer and the business side

120
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,681
because you have a reputation.

121
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,223
How to get champions is a whole other talk

122
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,664
that Nick Suttner is gonna give on Thursday at 4 p.m.

123
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:20,486
I highly suggest everybody go to that one if you can.

124
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:24,308
It's super, super useful, so please check that out.

125
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,430
I won't go into it so that I leave it for you, Nick, sorry.

126
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,475
But, anyway, reach doesn't necessarily guarantee that the design of your game and your vision

127
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:35,957
is accessible or discoverable to anyone who matters.

128
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:45,379
The second step is a step in discoverability, right?

129
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,739
And I think it used to be this.

130
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,700
I think a lot of discoverability was

131
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,461
when there were only a few thousand games on Steam, say,

132
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,841
or you had X many indies,

133
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:59,303
you could measurable amount of indies on a platform,

134
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:01,123
putting up a Steam page and a website

135
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:02,444
and a Twitter was definitely enough.

136
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:04,984
It's just not enough now.

137
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:06,245
It's tough to just end it there.

138
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,025
You'd be surprised how many people.

139
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,206
Check the box.

140
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:14,027
Now they're like, okay, I have a Steam page,

141
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:18,190
I have a website, I did it, I'm discoverable.

142
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,113
But that goes hand in hand with this next one,

143
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:23,494
which is that discoverability is passive.

144
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,496
This is an assumption that a lot of us make

145
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:29,979
when we work on super, super small teams.

146
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:37,943
I think it's, I have a lot of sympathy for this one because I think that talking about

147
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:42,625
this kind of stuff takes up an immense amount of mental space.

148
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,306
Even just thinking about when you're making a game by yourself or on a small team, what

149
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:49,507
it takes to be seen and how you're going to reach.

150
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:55,134
either an audience or a partner, such as a publisher,

151
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:59,599
it's so easy to say, well, I did everything that I was told

152
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,122
in 2011, all these things, I checked out these boxes,

153
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:05,226
I have a Steam page and I have a Twitter and a website,

154
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,227
why aren't I being seen?

155
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,108
And I don't have a clear answer for that beyond,

156
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:11,209
it's just not enough anymore.

157
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:12,949
It really is not passive.

158
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,350
It needs to be active constantly,

159
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,311
and you need to be reaching out to people all the time.

160
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,131
So again, another really dangerous assumption.

161
00:08:20,131 --> 00:08:21,572
It's just a piece of the puzzle in general.

162
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:24,793
The discoverability, findability and discoverability

163
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:25,733
aren't the same.

164
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:25,813
Okay.

165
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:32,249
I could talk about the next one for ages, but I won't.

166
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:34,771
This one can't be assumed at all,

167
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:35,731
and I think I see it a lot.

168
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,492
You probably have seen pitches like this before.

169
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:40,173
It's not the pitch that really worries me anymore.

170
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,034
I used to do a whole talk on why you shouldn't use

171
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,535
an elevator pitch that is like,

172
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:47,517
I'm making Minecraft meets Papers, Please.

173
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,438
And that was true, I think, at one point.

174
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:53,259
And now I think that it's a little less dangerous

175
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:54,000
on certain levels.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,341
Like, I think you can use shorthand quite a bit,

177
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,601
or depending on who you're speaking to.

178
00:08:58,182 --> 00:09:08,205
this is not a problem. The danger is assuming that you can or already do have

179
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:13,007
their audiences and you might be surprised again and how many pitches I

180
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:17,209
get where they're saying I'm making Papers, Please Me's Minecraft therefore

181
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:21,570
all the people that play either of those games automatically know about my game

182
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,191
or will know about it very easily.

183
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:28,126
And that, again, oh boy, is a whole can of worms

184
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:31,472
that I could go into and I won't.

185
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:35,278
So dangerous assumption.

186
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:35,659
Shorthand.

187
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:40,487
Okay, shorthand can be super, super useful,

188
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,308
but also really dangerous.

189
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,170
If you're 1000% certain that everybody in the room

190
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,511
knows the shorthand you're using,

191
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,333
like I mean common game dev terms,

192
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,015
or even genres like roguelike or something,

193
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,518
then you're fine, right?

194
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:55,720
But if you're not sure, you risk losing people right away.

195
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,222
Accessibility is super tricky,

196
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:02,266
and shorthand is pretty binary in whether it works or not.

197
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:02,947
Well, that's exciting.

198
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:07,209
But when you're using it, are you actually communicating

199
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:10,211
why your game is different from every other game

200
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:13,212
that uses the term you're using, such as roguelike?

201
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,033
Or are you just alienating an entire audience off the bat?

202
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:19,855
When you're pitching to, say, a narrative studio,

203
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,459
please use all the narrative shorthand you want, right?

204
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:27,082
But also arm us with context for that shorthand.

205
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:30,726
Make sure that we know what you're talking about

206
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:32,968
in a larger spectrum and make sure that other people

207
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,670
are understanding you.

208
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,291
Not all shorthand is useful.

209
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,734
All I can say there is use shorthand with caution

210
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:39,835
and with an appropriate audience.

211
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:44,527
So these are all the don'ts, like really common don'ts I see.

212
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:50,170
The next slide is sort of safer assumptions.

213
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,512
The reason I wrote it this way is that, and I'm

214
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:55,473
going to preface this with a bit of a ramble, I'm sorry.

215
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,675
I scrapped this talk from this slide forward

216
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:02,277
probably four times last year.

217
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:04,238
It's been really, really tough.

218
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:05,879
The industry changes all the time, right?

219
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,460
I mean, everything is constantly changing

220
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,362
and major platforms are making huge announcements

221
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:13,464
and the way we experience shipping a game

222
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,965
changes all the time.

223
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,366
And that's super scary, right?

224
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,267
Like I, in addition to being a scout,

225
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,528
like I said, I'm a developer,

226
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,469
so I get to see sort of both sides of that coin.

227
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:23,711
And it is really terrifying.

228
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:30,335
It's been super hard focusing on this talk in general

229
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,797
while so many different announcements are being made,

230
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,699
especially the way games are gonna be sold in the future

231
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,602
and all these sort of new platform ideas, et cetera.

232
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:44,405
So please understand that these assumptions are safe

233
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:47,747
or not necessarily a tutorial.

234
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,169
If I had more time, I might have been able to do more,

235
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:50,689
but here we are.

236
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:53,751
So I have to say that

237
00:11:57,408 --> 00:12:04,335
Designing with discoverability in mind is more important now than it, I believe, ever has been.

238
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:10,842
If you can't start testing your vision and its discoverability potential from day zero,

239
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:18,810
the risk of designing a game that is inaccessible and undiscoverable is much, much higher than it was in 2011.

240
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,211
What I mean by that is there are tons of developers

241
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:26,132
making games now, indie games specifically,

242
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:29,213
and in order to know if your design and vision is accessible,

243
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:32,253
I don't think we can afford to make the game first

244
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:35,114
and hope that it's accessible later.

245
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,894
We have to start doing it from day zero.

246
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:39,615
We have to communicate visions from the start,

247
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:42,356
and testing that communication to make sure it's accessible

248
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:43,416
is essential to the process.

249
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,590
I know this is super vague, all I can do right now

250
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,271
is try to drive home the takeaway

251
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,011
that this stuff is important.

252
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:51,772
I'd love to caveat with I'm not you,

253
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,153
I don't hold your vision,

254
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,433
and if you're already working on a project,

255
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:58,714
I'm certainly not your dedicated game designer

256
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:00,195
that you've definitely hired.

257
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:03,075
So I've come to realize that I can't give

258
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,816
much universal advice that applies to every project,

259
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:09,777
but I can talk about some things in the abstract.

260
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,578
So discoverability is proactive.

261
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:19,344
It's on us as developers now and to find partners such as publishers.

262
00:13:19,344 --> 00:13:24,608
It's on scouts to make sure that we are seeking out projects that are

263
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:27,510
close to discoverable, but probably need a little bit of help.

264
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,394
It's all about these partnerships that we can create and and flourish with from.

265
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:40,521
We have to use our reach and make sure we're pairing with the right pair of people basically, but it's just not enough, right? That's a multiplier.

266
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:46,406
So, you need to be able to make sure that your design is accessible from the get-go

267
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:47,427
in order to take advantage of that.

268
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,390
Discoverability is fluid.

269
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,494
I was told recently that there was definitely, I don't remember it, but I was told recently

270
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:59,817
that there was a point in time where Twitter was an excellent tool for discoverability.

271
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:02,119
It probably had something to do with hashtags back in the day.

272
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:04,081
I don't remember ever using those, but I know it happened.

273
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:08,225
I definitely believe that has changed, and that's just an example of how we have to make

274
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:09,606
sure the tools we're using...

275
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,507
and the multipliers we have are effective.

276
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:14,648
So we have to pay attention to how the market's shifting.

277
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:17,150
Who is looking for what?

278
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,811
What kind of games and what kind of audiences

279
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:23,533
are platforms seeking and focusing their attention on?

280
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:24,853
And that might be different now

281
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,874
than it was five or 10 years ago, right?

282
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,795
Like we all have an idea in our head

283
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:32,457
of what kind of audience comes to a specific platform

284
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:34,918
and what kind of publisher publishes a certain type of game.

285
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:38,221
But pay attention to those shifts and do a little bit of research.

286
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:42,904
I know that sounds really 101, but it's something that takes a lot of mental space, and I think

287
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:48,789
it's deeply, deeply worth doing early, because if you try to leave it until later, it's much,

288
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,209
much harder.

289
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:56,653
Okay, I don't think I've discussed accessibility enough

290
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,895
in general in my life, and definitely not in this talk.

291
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,038
So we can talk about it a little bit more here.

292
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:06,002
Your product is accessible if it takes relatively low effort

293
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,644
from the listener to understand.

294
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:11,466
and then be equipped to make a decision on continuing to engage or not.

295
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:16,409
Of course post-launch that gap is

296
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:17,570
pitch

297
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:24,754
think buy, but if you're pitching to a publisher, it's pitch, think, learn more, right?

298
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:25,714
That's all you can hope for.

299
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:28,716
I'm not going to assert that

300
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,837
I'm going to start, sorry, that the only way

301
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:33,858
to make sure your game and design are accessible

302
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:36,719
is by pitching it to people and testing their reactions.

303
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,140
And I definitely don't just mean other game developers.

304
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,882
It's super, super easy for developers in general,

305
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:46,503
especially at GDC, to get caught in the mindset of,

306
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:49,765
but I have so many people who love my idea,

307
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:52,085
it must be really good and accessible.

308
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,026
But if all those people are fellow developers

309
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,947
and you've never tested the game out on anyone else,

310
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:57,868
you're doing yourself and your game a huge disservice.

311
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:02,810
So, my advice on this one is,

312
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,371
I don't know if you have this, but I do.

313
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:09,193
That uncle at Thanksgiving who approaches you

314
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:11,294
and says, I have a great idea for an app,

315
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,215
it's gonna make us a million dollars,

316
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,996
and it makes me wanna shrivel up

317
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:18,177
into a raisin of a human before dinner even happens.

318
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,638
That's who you have to pitch to.

319
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:24,460
And I don't mean he needs to like the game.

320
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,261
And I don't even mean that he has to deeply understand it.

321
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:35,060
he will give you an excellent sense of what sort of attention span someone who isn't already

322
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,862
in your dedicated circles or even interested in games has.

323
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:42,264
And that's the goal, is to know what that attention span is.

324
00:16:42,264 --> 00:16:46,527
Because if you can make your game accessible, if you can make your pitch, forget the game,

325
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:50,369
it's not about playing it, even your pitch from day zero, if you can make it accessible

326
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:50,869
to him.

327
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:55,058
during dinner at Thanksgiving, you've done it.

328
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:56,860
Like that's the measure, right?

329
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,764
And I think accessibility in general

330
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:05,167
is probably the strongest point that gets you a publisher.

331
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,968
It's what tells me as a scout,

332
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:09,210
okay, we can talk to an audience about this game,

333
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,732
and that audience, even if it's niche,

334
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:13,274
is gonna understand and be excited about what you're making.

335
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:17,919
I will say Becca Saltzman did a talk yesterday, I believe,

336
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,320
oh, I might be wrong on that, that covered pitching

337
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,560
and how to do that to publishers.

338
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,461
It was yesterday, right?

339
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:24,101
Yeah, thank you, John.

340
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:27,083
I highly recommend checking that one out.

341
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,003
She sees a lot of pitches like I do,

342
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,964
and I don't want to overlap with her too much,

343
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:33,105
so I won't go into pitching to publishers

344
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:33,885
on a detailed level.

345
00:17:35,246 --> 00:17:42,593
that talk probably will arm you with a lot of details on how to make an accessible pitch in general.

346
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:46,897
I really wish I knew a way to ensure accessibility beyond telling you to talk to annoying Uncle Jerry

347
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:50,600
and going through, or going through each and every one of your pitches, right,

348
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,383
to make sure you're all making products that have accessible cores.

349
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:57,645
Or even if I could define for you now,

350
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:59,805
so that in two or three years we can all agree

351
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:03,066
the pitch is still accessible and desirable, I can't.

352
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,326
But it does bring me to my favorite slide

353
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:05,946
that is in all my decks.

354
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:06,947
Unpopular opinions.

355
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,527
Things I don't say on Twitter anymore.

356
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,481
Okay, I don't think you're pitching your creative vision,

357
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:26,582
so please stop trying to communicate that vision.

358
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:30,083
I think that your creative vision is deeply important,

359
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,863
and it is yours, and it's something

360
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,283
that not everyone can understand.

361
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:36,964
Therefore, I think you are actually pitching a product

362
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:38,825
inspired by your creative vision.

363
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,665
And so the thing that has to be discoverable

364
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:41,865
is not your creative vision.

365
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:43,926
And I think a lot of people get stuck in that initial loop,

366
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,806
where they're like, but you just don't understand.

367
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:47,147
If only you could see my vision,

368
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:48,927
you would understand why this is such a good game.

369
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:56,511
A really big part of that is not pitching a product inspired by that creative vision.

370
00:18:56,511 --> 00:19:02,774
I think that there are lots of people probably in the world that can help you with that.

371
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:07,036
I mean, there are people, there are PR people, and there are designers, and there are all

372
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,536
sorts of people in the world.

373
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:11,938
But if you don't have contact with them, this one becomes very, very, very difficult.

374
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:14,559
If you're isolated in some way, this one's very difficult.

375
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
You can really get stuck in your own head over it.

376
00:19:19,102 --> 00:19:22,864
I also believe heavily that publishers and champions are more necessary now than ever.

377
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:28,228
I think that pairing with a publisher who even sees your creative vision in some way

378
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:31,370
can lead to you having a product.

379
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,132
You just have to convince them of that, and that's where accessibility comes into play.

380
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:41,336
I also strongly believe that—well, this is math—but I strongly believe that multipliers

381
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,158
on zero still equal zero.

382
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:45,239
It doesn't matter if your reach is—

383
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:51,911
a million Twitter followers, if they don't understand anything and they're not going to champion your game, that multiplier is just multiplying zero.

384
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:56,353
And it's very frustrating. I see a lot of people doing it a lot of the time and it breaks my heart.

385
00:19:56,353 --> 00:20:01,194
But so these unpopular opinions, I just need to put this in here.

386
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:01,454
You know...

387
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:05,561
I'm okay with it, by the way, if you don't want to make money.

388
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:09,144
That's not what I'm talking about here.

389
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,845
I'm saying that your pitch needs to be something

390
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:12,966
that an audience can imagine spending currency on,

391
00:20:12,966 --> 00:20:18,510
and that currency can be attention, money, time, all three.

392
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,131
At a high level, it's kind of irrelevant.

393
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,973
You're going to use different language for each of those currencies,

394
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,754
but the mentality has to stay the same.

395
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:28,036
I'm designing with this accessibility in mind

396
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:30,197
so as to communicate it easily and effectively.

397
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:34,661
So pitch a product, please, please, please, please pitch a product.

398
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,844
Whether it'll make money or not, that's fine.

399
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:41,389
Okay, what does anything that I just said mean?

400
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,143
Turn your creative vision into a plan for a product.

401
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:47,144
Not necessarily a product.

402
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:49,386
I get that there are steps in between, right?

403
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:52,508
Please try to turn it into a plan.

404
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,530
This will ensure discoverability,

405
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,192
at least from a publisher's point of view.

406
00:20:57,192 --> 00:21:00,135
Seeing that you have a plan at all for a vision

407
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,176
into a product is gonna be massive for us.

408
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:06,259
Take it from day zero, outline a plan.

409
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,681
I can't go over all of this in this talk.

410
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,103
I'm already at 20 minutes, 21 minutes, which is so tragic.

411
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,045
But this is why things like design documents,

412
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:18,408
even if they're just a stream of consciousness are crucial.

413
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,289
You have to hone your vision down

414
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:23,391
until Jerry at Thanksgiving dinner can understand it,

415
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:26,373
or at least can give you 30 seconds of his time

416
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:29,315
and you can retain that, right?

417
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:31,817
Something, oh, sorry, yes.

418
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:36,410
I don't know how to emphasize this enough.

419
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,150
Jerry is a nut.

420
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,131
Jerry is good, a good start.

421
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,293
Uncle Jerry at Thanksgiving is a good start.

422
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:43,254
I just need you to test it on everyone you know.

423
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:45,976
Once you get down, once you've got your design,

424
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:48,298
you're like, okay, I have this vision, I love it.

425
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:49,799
I'm gonna bring it down to something

426
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,899
I think I can communicate.

427
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,122
You have to test it on literally everybody you know.

428
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:56,544
And I know that's scary, especially with as many games

429
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:57,585
that are coming out right now.

430
00:21:57,585 --> 00:22:00,927
Developers are loath to share their ideas

431
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,289
and are really scared about doing that.

432
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,931
But if you're pitching to people who have nothing to do

433
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:08,654
with games, it's much lower risk of another fellow designer

434
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,035
running off and making your game, right?

435
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:11,656
I know we all have that worry because we're all trying

436
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:15,339
to make a living, but I really do believe that

437
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:19,280
we can't afford anymore to hold it so precious

438
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,001
and then to make the game and then to find out

439
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:25,363
once we launch it that nobody understands it, right?

440
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:26,843
Discoverability isn't the end result

441
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:30,405
of who saw your game at launch.

442
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:34,026
It's much more than that, and that part feels

443
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:36,067
pretty important to me, so I'll throw up

444
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,147
on the slide of its own.

445
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,048
Sorry, I forgot to put it here.

446
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,629
But, oh, no, I'm stupid.

447
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:43,109
I forgot the most important part of the slide.

448
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:51,500
If you're having a tough time communicating how a player interacts with your game,

449
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,965
you might have a design problem.

450
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,953
It will feel like a communication problem, right?

451
00:22:56,953 --> 00:23:00,194
But I urge everyone to take a step back again.

452
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:02,535
If you're testing it over and over again

453
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:05,177
and there's a block, it might actually be

454
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:08,278
a design problem from day zero,

455
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,499
not necessarily a problem with just your pitch

456
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:14,321
or someone else understanding your vision.

457
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,421
That one's super, super intense.

458
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:15,981
Okay, in conclusion.

459
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,721
It's not the end result of who you saw your game at launch.

460
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:27,322
Discoverability is the quality, process,

461
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,363
and design by which your game holds potential

462
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:34,325
for people to see it at every phase of development.

463
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:38,206
And I believe strongly that this starts at day zero

464
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:41,067
and relies on a plan for a product, not just a vision,

465
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:44,208
and that gets me in trouble all the time.

466
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,248
But this is how I feel.

467
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,309
There we go, it's there.

468
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:57,352
really want you to think about this as making us, especially Scouts, believe in not just

469
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,753
you but also your product.

470
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:02,675
And if you can't do that from the beginning, it's just going to be much, much harder to

471
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,376
do it later on.

472
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:08,026
Kind of the end.

473
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,487
I wanted to leave room for questions.

474
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:11,227
We're at 25 minutes, I believe.

475
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:14,228
That only leaves five minutes for questions

476
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:17,169
and 25 minute talk isn't much.

477
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,789
At the end of the day, I would love,

478
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,410
if the only thing you take away from this

479
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,810
is don't be afraid of making a product.

480
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,251
It'll empower your vision to reach the most people.

481
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,111
That would be the most discoverability

482
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:28,992
you can possibly get, for sure.

483
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:32,154
And I urge you to check out both Becca and Nick's talk.

484
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,436
And I did look at the schedule.

485
00:24:34,436 --> 00:24:37,537
I'm up against some really amazing people in this slot.

486
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:38,778
I'm so glad for the vault

487
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,479
because I think you should probably check out

488
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,140
everybody else's talks today too.

489
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,841
That's it.

490
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:47,103
It seemed like it went by really fast.

491
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,064
But there it is.

492
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:58,480
Cool, I can't see any of you, so if you have questions,

493
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,902
I have no idea how I would know.

494
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,143
No, none?

495
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:03,184
I don't know, I can't see, so.

496
00:25:03,184 --> 00:25:07,208
Oh, there's a mic, okay, perfect.

497
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:07,908
No, then, we're good.

498
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,209
I'm gonna drink this boxed water.

499
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:09,910
It's very weird.

500
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,510
It tastes like cardboard.

501
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,870
All the mics went off.

502
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,130
OK, hi.

503
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,210
No.

504
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:37,770
There we go.

505
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:37,990
Never mind.

506
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,291
What would good aspects of an elevator talk be?

507
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,212
Elevator pitch.

508
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:50,653
OK, so this is a whole other talk.

509
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:53,114
And I've done some cool elevator pitches.

510
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:55,834
I think there's actually a really good elevator pitch

511
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:56,514
talk this year.

512
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,135
I have to look it up again.

513
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:05,519
From a publisher's perspective, an elevator pitch is much more than the consumer pitch

514
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,181
that you're going to give.

515
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:13,005
You have a lot more space and time, and you really do need a deck.

516
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,208
I don't think I've ever signed a game that had just an elevator pitch in my life.

517
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:20,671
I've signed plenty of games, but they're all full decks.

518
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:26,416
The beauty of talking to a publisher is not that you have to have a one sentence that

519
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,217
describes your genre.

520
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:36,681
genre and hook and theme and narrative, like whatever it is that you think needs to go in your vision or needs to be

521
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,142
communicated from your vision.

522
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:43,023
For a publisher a deck is incredibly important.

523
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:50,925
There's no way you can communicate to me whether you're designing with discoverability in mind in general or whether you're designing with an audience in mind even,

524
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:54,047
except through an entire deck that outlines your vision.

525
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:59,232
And that's where I would say, sorry, I'm deferring the question, but that's where I would say

526
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:03,215
definitely go to, or, okay, you can't go to it, it was yesterday, it's the past.

527
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:06,779
But look up Becca's talk, because I think that's going to help quite a bit, yeah.

528
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:11,103
And elevator pitches are, we have, I mean, it feels like now it's a little easier than

529
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:14,386
it used to be in that we have a little more space to talk to consumers, there's like a

530
00:27:14,386 --> 00:27:15,648
little more, you know.

531
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:18,650
you can gain a following on Twitter

532
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,011
and you can have a Facebook group and stuff like that

533
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:22,572
where you can discuss more.

534
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:26,055
But as of right now, from my perspective,

535
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:27,756
an elevator pitch just isn't enough.

536
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:30,097
So yeah, doing a whole deck is what's really important.

537
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:30,998
Yeah, sorry, that was kind of a non-answer.

538
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:31,418
You tweeting things?

539
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:31,598
All right.

540
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:31,658
Oh.

541
00:27:31,658 --> 00:27:31,939
I got a question.

542
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:32,499
So one thing I wanna ask is,

543
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:49,801
When you're going around to publishers trying to get them to see your game and you're sending

544
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:54,624
lots and lots of emails, a lot of publishers I know get hundreds of emails a day and can't

545
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:55,685
really sort through them all.

546
00:27:55,685 --> 00:28:00,228
What would you say your tips are for having your best shot at getting a response from

547
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,549
publishers?

548
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,910
Yeah, awesome question.

549
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:08,711
Badger? No. I mean, do bug, right?

550
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:11,953
Like the thing is, when I get hundreds of emails a day,

551
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:14,595
oftentimes things do slip through the cracks, right?

552
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:17,097
Following up on an email is like not a bad thing to do.

553
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,499
I think a lot of us think of it as a bad thing.

554
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:21,581
I think many, many people are like,

555
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:24,263
well, I sent an email in October, I didn't hear back.

556
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:27,185
I sent a new email in December, I didn't hear back.

557
00:28:28,214 --> 00:28:30,135
Threading is very powerful.

558
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:32,916
Responding to your email and following up on it

559
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,896
with the same subject line is gonna put it in a thread

560
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:38,417
in my Gmail inbox and it's really, really powerful.

561
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,739
It also is a great indicator as to, you know,

562
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,939
when I was super busy so I can look back and say like,

563
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:45,020
oh, I did see this, right?

564
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,221
the chances are I did see it or that a scout did see it,

565
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:51,642
it's just that at the moment it wasn't the priority, right?

566
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,682
Hearing back is really, really tough.

567
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,683
Like, it is a difficult thing.

568
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:57,463
But I think that getting involved,

569
00:28:57,463 --> 00:28:58,724
a lot of publishers have communities now

570
00:28:58,724 --> 00:28:59,984
and getting involved in that community

571
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:01,105
is also really awesome.

572
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,085
So, for example, Fellow Traveler has a Discord

573
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:06,386
and they have a whole community of people

574
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:07,346
who are playing their games.

575
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:14,708
and if you can show any interest in the community that fellow traveler, for example, or any publisher

576
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:20,509
is cultivating and partake in that, it might be a little bit easier for them to take notice.

577
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:26,571
That's not me saying DM everybody all the time, but it is saying don't be afraid to do it, right?

578
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:30,131
And you'd be surprised how many people approach me at a convention and say,

579
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:33,232
oh, I emailed you last year, but I never heard back, so I just didn't think anything of it.

580
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:37,536
and I'm mortified, first of all, right?

581
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:39,218
I mean, I'm a human and I miss things,

582
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:42,561
but yeah, I really do think that

583
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:44,763
if that initial email had all the things in it, right,

584
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:47,726
which is to say, I need some form of hook.

585
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:51,210
So if your game is beautiful, please send screenshots.

586
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:53,012
If your game has a strong narrative hook

587
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:54,553
and you want fellow traveler to publish it

588
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:56,715
because it was like other games they've published,

589
00:29:57,336 --> 00:30:05,199
mention that, right? Make it really easy for me to just to find out more about your game. So that's where that initial

590
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:09,941
findability comes into play where it's like put up a Twitter, put up a website,

591
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:15,423
send me a bio about you. Like selling yourself and selling your game are one in the same at that point.

592
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:19,865
So you have to be able to package it all so that it takes me

593
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:26,588
less than five minutes to click through things and find things, right? If it's just a cold email with just text,

594
00:30:27,148 --> 00:30:28,568
I'm always gonna pass it by, right?

595
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:30,709
It just won't take precedent over other stuff.

596
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:33,850
So I could go into, I mean, I did a talk recently

597
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,791
on literally like everything that needs to go into an email.

598
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,751
Hi, sorry, yes, I am finishing right now.

599
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:44,032
And I can't, unfortunately can't do that one here,

600
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:46,093
but email me and I can go over it with you

601
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,773
and I can send you that slide deck for sure.

602
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:48,654
Cool, all right, thank you very much.

603
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:48,954
All right.

604
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:49,234
Be good.
