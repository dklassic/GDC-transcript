1
00:00:03,021 --> 00:00:10,692
still somewhat hungover from last night. I know this is the

2
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:12,976
first talk of the day and I appreciate all of you taking the

3
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:16,561
time to come out and see my presentation.

4
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:23,519
So my name is John Jones and I have spent the majority of my career working remotely and I've

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,844
learned a lot of things through trial and error and mistakes I've made, successes I've seen in

6
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:35,849
others and I've been writing and speaking for years on the subject of how to be a really

7
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:41,073
effective remote worker, contractor, freelancer, and essentially just helping

8
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:48,349
I learn as I go and I'm very honest about what I've learned, my mistakes, my successes,

9
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:52,753
and I like relaying that to other people so they can get to the same point where I feel

10
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:57,517
I am in my career, where I have more choice and control over what I do, how I do it, and

11
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:01,220
get to, most importantly, live where I want instead of not having to move everywhere.

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,264
So hopefully this presentation will give all of you an idea of some of the tips and

13
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:12,071
techniques you can use to start working remotely, whether you're working full time,

14
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:16,336
working full time doing so and want to keep doing that for your existing employer or if you

15
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:20,921
want to make a complete break and go into the exciting world and stressful world of

16
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:21,601
freelancing. So first off,

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,891
I have 16 years in game development, nine of them remote,

18
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:30,672
I've worked on over 50 titles.

19
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:33,112
My specialization is as an outsourcing manager,

20
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:36,974
as a freelancer, which to my knowledge, nobody else does.

21
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:38,894
And I've been doing that since 2009.

22
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:41,495
And I've been building and managing remote teams

23
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:43,756
of anywhere from five to 75 people

24
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:45,517
for a variety of clients and employers,

25
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:49,398
including Epic Games, Avalanche Studios, 2K Games,

26
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,599
NC Soft, Sony Online Entertainment, et cetera.

27
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:58,222
So I've had a lot of experience at studios, both large and small, all kinds of tool sets.

28
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:04,625
And all that began because in 2008 and 2009, I was laid off twice in one year and I was at the

29
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:10,747
point of forget this. And I decided, okay, I'm going to take more control over this. I'm not

30
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,548
going to be beholden to one boss anymore.

31
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:17,970
didn't, it bothered me a little bit that technically there's no such thing as a freelance

32
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,132
outsourcing manager, but I lived in Austin, it was cheap enough to live off unemployment and

33
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:27,414
severance, so I figured I'd make a go of it. Eight years later, I'm living in Brooklyn and

34
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,074
doing the same thing.

35
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:35,078
So, cutting the tether. Much has been written about the tools, the philosophy, the home

36
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:41,119
set-ups, what hardware to buy, what attitudes to have, blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to

37
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,180
do that. I'm not here to repeat those. And frankly, I've done several talks on them as

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,161
well. On my website I've had other talk presentations and articles on specifically what

39
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:55,902
hardware to buy if you want to be an independent content developer on like the Unity

40
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:59,323
asset store, the Unreal Engine marketplace, which I used to run, I have an article on

41
00:02:59,323 --> 00:02:59,623
that.

42
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:04,251
I don't want to retread that, I want to go into the nitty gritty details that I haven't

43
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,196
heard other people talk about before in hopes that some of this will stick.

44
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:12,991
So ask yourself, what do you really want to do? Do you want to do the same job as now, only

45
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:17,732
doing it from home, just transition into being someone that works full time from home with

46
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:22,534
your current employer? Do you want to freelance from contract to contract? Or is your

47
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:26,615
ultimate dream to develop your own game and just pay the bills by freelancing until you're

48
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:30,277
in a position where your game is released and that can be your full time thing?

49
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:34,556
So scenario one is doing the same job from home.

50
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,497
When in your heart of hearts,

51
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,818
you really just want to spend more time

52
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,319
with your cats and wearing shorts.

53
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,899
So, but the sad truth of this is,

54
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:44,740
sometimes organizations simply will not allow remote work

55
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,621
and there's only so much you can do

56
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,682
like within those parameters.

57
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:51,043
Sometimes it may be a non-starter,

58
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:53,444
but it's still worth feeling out.

59
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:56,165
And I'm going to go into some tips and techniques

60
00:03:56,165 --> 00:04:00,086
for how to negotiate that and earn your way into doing so.

61
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:05,230
typically speaking, management by walking around is the norm,

62
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,613
seeing people at their desks, speaking from the management

63
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,576
producer level on down, okay, all these desks are full, looks

64
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:15,579
like they're working the applications I expect. So

65
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,962
scenario one, the same job from home. So management by walking

66
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:22,925
around is the norm. It's essentially producer or manager

67
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:25,187
walking around saying, okay, this person is at their desk,

68
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:25,888
this person isn't.

69
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:31,860
the appropriate applications are open. I can sit down and have a quick casual conversation if I

70
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,167
need to. It's a lot easier to just casually encounter someone walking around in the

71
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:40,754
workplace and get a general sense of what's going on and to be able to have a specific

72
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:41,154
request.

73
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:44,496
for them doing so.

74
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,957
Some managers prefer being able to see people

75
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,238
physically face to face.

76
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:51,560
Others prefer doing all of it digitally,

77
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,101
either through Hangouts or Slack or even SMS.

78
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,522
I've had some bosses, which is strange.

79
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:59,724
So for people that, managers that prefer walking around,

80
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:02,165
their ability to control their environment

81
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:03,906
and feel confident in what they're doing

82
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:06,407
involves being able to see people,

83
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,147
being able to speak to them,

84
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:08,728
and being able to serve them physically.

85
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:14,393
So in the worst possible case, for them, remote work is a loss of their control.

86
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:19,297
So you have to go out of your way to increase your presence remotely

87
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:22,660
and make it easier for them to feel comfortable knowing what you're doing

88
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,042
and to have you be a predictable component of development.

89
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:28,317
This is a way to alleviate anxiety in a boss,

90
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:31,659
which is, generally speaking, a really good thing.

91
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,081
So fortunately, a lot of these techniques

92
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,162
for increasing your productivity,

93
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,884
increasing your reliability and presence

94
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:40,305
can be practiced on site.

95
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:44,096
For example, projecting yourself remotely

96
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:46,178
is the biggest thing you can do as a remote worker

97
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,139
to be able to increase confidence,

98
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,462
not only in your bosses, but also in your team,

99
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,604
so they can know that you're someone reliable,

100
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,705
they can be assigned work,

101
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:57,187
and they know what you're gonna do and where to expect it.

102
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:02,985
So your job is to be where they look first. What are their basic expectations in the day-to-day

103
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:09,112
workflow? Some people use slack, some people have internal messaging systems, some people

104
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:14,158
have like an internal forum or like base camp shotgun, something like that.

105
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:20,569
Just find out where that expectation is and focus your efforts on being visible there,

106
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,555
because you have to actively participate and actively make your presence known far above

107
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:28,496
average than you would if you were working in house.

108
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,539
And that's a really, that's a large hump to get over.

109
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:35,642
So while you're still working at a studio, you can try and increase your presence digitally

110
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:39,726
to find out how to get people's attention when you can't simply walk over to their desk.

111
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,208
You have to always actively compensate for being out of sight.

112
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:46,971
So there are a lot of ways you can challenge yourself to be able to get answers if you're not

113
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:51,955
physically there, even though you still are. For example, which co-workers ignore email and

114
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:56,098
instant messaging? Who's always texting? That could be one way to reach people. If source

115
00:06:56,098 --> 00:07:00,801
control is down, where else is the information you need to live? Is it somewhere on the

116
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,522
server? Is it...

117
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:06,289
like back up on Dropbox somewhere, do you have access to that and can you get it? These are

118
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:11,498
things you have to seek out and think about when you work remotely because if you're 30

119
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,623
minutes to an hour away from the office and you have no other way to access it except

120
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,586
physically, you should have planned better.

121
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:20,300
And another situation, if it's late and you need help,

122
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,563
and you know from being in the office who always stays late,

123
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:24,646
that person's a potential resource.

124
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:26,008
You have to constantly challenge yourself

125
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:28,511
to try and find out how would I seek these things out

126
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,994
if I didn't have physical access to the facility,

127
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:34,159
and what do I need to have access to at this studio

128
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,260
for me to be productive?

129
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,902
even if no one else is around. You have to learn to be extremely self‑sufficient and no one

130
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:45,585
will really teach you that. In a way this is like a build‑up to being able to ask if you can

131
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:50,067
work remotely, which I will get to, but always challenge yourself and pose interesting

132
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:54,589
problems to yourself to try to solve. You also have to accept greater

133
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,231
responsibility. So when you're working remotely, you're responsible for your own

134
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:04,113
hardware, storage, connectivity, a high rate of responsiveness and consistent productivity.

135
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:09,351
So I bring up productivity in particular because it's the best

136
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,093
thing you can do if you're working off-site to maintain

137
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:15,276
confidence in your team and in your bosses is to be a

138
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:19,299
consistent, reliable resource. I think of it as a marathon

139
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,502
instead of a sprint. I'd rather someone that was about 90%

140
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,285
productive every day consistently so I know what to

141
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,587
expect of them instead of one day they're an incredible

142
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:32,710
performer, the next day they're barely there, and then the next

143
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,291
day they're an incredible performer again.

144
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:38,375
the more you can be a component they don't have to actively have to think about,

145
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,417
the more valuable you are to the company.

146
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:43,561
And a lot of that is how you're able to project yourself remotely

147
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,844
and be where they look first in what they expect of you.

148
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,605
So I see this, so if you're working for someone full time,

149
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:57,927
I see earning your way up to being able to work remotely

150
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,588
as the end point of a campaign,

151
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:01,448
you have to start in the beginning.

152
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,769
So you have to lay the groundwork

153
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:05,310
to increase your perceived value internally and externally.

154
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,530
So step it up at work and perform better than ever and show that you can sustain that over

155
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,471
time. Like I said before, if you can be a solid 90 percent productivity every day instead of

156
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:20,813
fluctuating quite a bit, that will build a lot of trust in that environment. You have to

157
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:25,994
increase your mastery of the tools and technology and understand what you need to be able to

158
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:31,196
get the job done either on site or off site and showing that kind of technical mastery very

159
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,576
much unlike what I did in trying to get this up on the screen.

160
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,818
that can be a huge confidence builder

161
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:39,622
and help build a case for you being able to work remotely.

162
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,947
Also, write about what you do, write about your craft.

163
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:47,387
Blog, publish, get involved in online forums.

164
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:50,188
Like, work on creating a credible name for yourself

165
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:52,489
and help other people in doing so.

166
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:55,009
Basically, the more you write or talk about a thing,

167
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,350
the firmer that gets in your mind,

168
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,670
the easier it is to explain,

169
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,771
the better it is, the more of a subject matter expert

170
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,651
you seem, and generally speaking,

171
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:06,432
employers like and promote and encourage that.

172
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:07,932
And a lot of people won't do it.

173
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,613
So if you can make that kind of,

174
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,713
if you can distinguish yourself.

175
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:16,676
in that kind of way that will also help build the case for you being able to be allowed to work

176
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:23,400
remotely. Also speak at conferences, both local and national. Find local user groups like the

177
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,763
IGDA that Ian and I have spoken at several times before. That's an excellent resource. Just

178
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:33,545
building up that kind of portfolio as a public facing subject matter expert is yet another

179
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:36,847
reason to be able to be granted the privilege to work off-site.

180
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,434
and as I said earlier, practice your telepresence while you're on site and find out how to be a

181
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:48,097
visible contributor, not just walking around, not just in meetings, but also like inside your

182
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:53,101
actual tool set. Like inside whatever tools you use where other developers are going to be able

183
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:57,464
to see your contributions. You need to learn to communicate that openly and clearly. So it's

184
00:10:57,464 --> 00:11:02,207
obvious that whether or not you're physically on site, they know where to look to see that you're

185
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,508
getting things done and that is concretely provable.

186
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,381
And this will make your request to work from home

187
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,342
a much easier thing to say yes to.

188
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:11,224
And this is something that should begin realistically

189
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:12,805
three to six months before you really want

190
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,106
to target doing that.

191
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,367
Again, consistency and predictability is key here.

192
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,662
So how to ask.

193
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:21,544
First off, just ask your employer about their work from

194
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,265
home policy and how flexible they are on that.

195
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,566
This varies wildly.

196
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,627
Some places are really open to it.

197
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:29,550
Some places are very resistant to it.

198
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,012
The campaign for proving yourself to be more reliable,

199
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,494
practicing your telepresence, all those things will get you

200
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,936
a little bit closer to a yes in environments where they're

201
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:41,399
not necessarily going to be amenable to letting you just

202
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,200
go off and work from home.

203
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,622
It's an extended buttering up period, essentially.

204
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,598
So if you're pitching, here's how I could work from home,

205
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:53,519
it's incredibly important to clearly define

206
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,179
what performing to expectations means.

207
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:58,840
So you have to have goal posts that are concrete,

208
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,361
provable, that you can prove that you have crossed

209
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,661
in order to map out progress over time.

210
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:07,242
So let's say I'd like to work from home

211
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:08,963
one day per week to start.

212
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:11,043
Here is how much productivity is expected of me,

213
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,744
like this amount of work or this amount of output.

214
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:20,668
whatever, some sort of concrete metric that you can point to and refer back to historically.

215
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:23,890
So at the end of let's say a three month review period of working one day from home, you can

216
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:29,054
say, look, I kept my promise, I maintained this consistent level of production over this

217
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:33,797
amount of time based on these agreed upon parameters that we negotiated in advance. If

218
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:37,459
you feel this is going well based on this, like based on this review,

219
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,622
could I do two days per week? And at that point the negotiations move forward, it will be a

220
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:50,106
little bit easier to ask for more. And again, everyone's case is unique, but this is at the

221
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:53,928
very least a starting point for finding out whether or not you can do that in your

222
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:59,071
organization and you can plan accordingly. And again, always be consistent, predictable,

223
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,713
and dependable. As a manager you don't want to have to worry is this going to be a productive

224
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,095
day for them working from home or is it going to be a nothing day?

225
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:10,487
have they done nothing but post cat pictures on Twitter all day or am I getting 150

226
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:16,291
emails of all the change lists I checked in this afternoon. Never make them wonder. The

227
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,313
less they have to actively think about you the better because they know what you can

228
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:24,556
produce, they know where to look for it. It's a part of their day to day already and you're

229
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:29,439
not something they have to actively follow up with or be concerned with because you're

230
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,200
everywhere they're looking.

231
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:37,811
and also don't be sneaky. Anything except for full honesty will ruin this opportunity and it

232
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:43,134
will ruin the working relationship. I was in a situation once where one of my developers was

233
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:46,096
secretly trying to work from home because he moved too far away to commute.

234
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:49,659
So, a piecemeal, he would borrow equipment and work from home and say,

235
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,461
oh, I have a doctor's appointment, can I just work for the rest of the day from home?

236
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:56,704
To the point where he just thought that he could stop coming in one day

237
00:13:56,704 --> 00:14:01,708
and say, oh, well, I've already borrowed all this equipment, I don't really need to come in ever again, do I?

238
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:07,092
No, that was not the case, and that permanently ended his opportunity of working from home

239
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:09,614
pretty much ever again, because he was not open and honest about it.

240
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:13,017
Although I admit it was kind of comical the way he went about it.

241
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,876
So scenario two, the freelancer life.

242
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:18,397
I'm not looking to be tied down right now.

243
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:21,999
So the sad truth is, freelancing is really hard.

244
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,820
You'll spend at least 50% of your time

245
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,742
doing business development.

246
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,523
You, like, in your heart of hearts,

247
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:29,744
you're thinking you're gonna be sitting at home

248
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,746
with your Cintiq or with your laptop.

249
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,467
kicking your feet up in your favorite chair,

250
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:38,068
and just rocking out, doing really cool stuff all the time.

251
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:40,029
No, a lot of this is gonna be emailing people,

252
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,330
asking for work, following up,

253
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,712
trying to collect on payments,

254
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,432
filling out tons and tons of paperwork,

255
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,553
having a legal contact sometimes,

256
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:51,494
having to do your own taxes

257
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,595
or pay a tax professional to do them.

258
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,255
It is really, really annoying.

259
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:57,336
It's only half of it is what you think.

260
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:02,178
It is absolutely not for everybody. Because there are a

261
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:04,458
lot of ‑‑ so if you're working in a studio, all of

262
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:08,340
these things are taken care of for you. So you'll begin to

263
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,421
immediately appreciate what admin, legal, finance and

264
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:14,922
business dev departments really do for you. They

265
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:20,521
They oil the gears that keep the engine running. When you go out and freelance on your own, all of

266
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:26,786
that is up to you. And you become painfully aware of, oh, wow, this is literally everything but my

267
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:32,090
direct job was taken care of for me. This is a lot more. And a lot of people don't really last

268
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,913
beyond the first six months to one year of freelancing because it's a splash of cold water.

269
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:39,008
and it can be really fun when it's at its best,

270
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:41,430
but just know there's, 50% of it's gonna be

271
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,094
fairly unpleasant unless you just love signing NDAs

272
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,076
and forms and chasing people down for payments.

273
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:53,898
So where do I start? So first, if you're going the freelance route, find out what kind of

274
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:58,979
side work your employer permits, if any. If they don't, don't freelance. Don't find yourself in a

275
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:03,640
situation where your current employer could technically legally own the content you're

276
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,801
creating for whatever client you have on the side. That is ugly, that's messy, that will

277
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:12,742
blacklist you as a freelancer and always stay on the right side of whatever contracts you

278
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:16,303
have signed and abide by. Do not mess around with that.

279
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,247
So if they do not allow side work,

280
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,909
you can start yet another campaign

281
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:26,952
to break out on your own and start gathering clients.

282
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,855
So be prolific, publish, broadcast your work,

283
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,957
start months before you want to go full-time remote.

284
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:34,588
Think of it as a marketing campaign.

285
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:37,250
So if you're an artist, be on Art Station, be on CG Talk,

286
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,352
be on Poly Count, enter every contest.

287
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:41,793
Whenever other people are entering contests,

288
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,334
comment on their work.

289
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,616
It doesn't have to be 100% self-promotion,

290
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,837
but if you can make yourself a part of the communities

291
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:48,318
in which...

292
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:52,799
active freelancers and other subject matter experts

293
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,221
alongside you, see you as a regular fixture.

294
00:16:56,221 --> 00:17:00,102
That is, and you can be a normal part of that consistently

295
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,364
over time and consistently produce good work,

296
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:04,844
and it's not 100% self-promotion.

297
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:07,666
That will make it much easier for people to come to you,

298
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,627
especially if you publish tutorials, if you give talks,

299
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,007
and if you write about the craft

300
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:13,848
and you get really involved with other professionals.

301
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:20,515
I just signed my 50th project recently and literally every

302
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,877
single gig I have ever had on every title has been a result of

303
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,959
a referral because I had been socially active in various

304
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,200
Internet forums and like a poly count in particular.

305
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,001
and because I write and publish.

306
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:36,105
At a certain point, people start coming to you

307
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,087
because you are there consistently and presently enough,

308
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:43,410
and I cannot emphasize how important that aspect of it is.

309
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,291
You would be surprised once you really get

310
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,032
that inertia going.

311
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:50,965
And most importantly, never stop doing it once you start.

312
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,126
If you only show up when people,

313
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:56,028
like when you need something from other people,

314
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:57,889
it's easy to write you off.

315
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,070
Just be a part of the community

316
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,651
because you want to be a part of the community,

317
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:03,172
not solely because you're trying to extract value from it.

318
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:03,773
People can tell.

319
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:06,447
So, where to find clients?

320
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:09,249
If at all possible, never burn bridges

321
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,110
and stay in touch with former employers.

322
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,193
They are the greatest source of either continuing work

323
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:17,375
or references to other studio heads

324
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,156
or other studios that are looking for work.

325
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:23,059
And just every, anywhere, like two, three, six months,

326
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,180
just checking in with them,

327
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,461
seeing if they have any needs,

328
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:28,143
or if they have, or if they know of anybody that's looking,

329
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,485
that can be an extremely valuable source

330
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,306
of potential revenue, like in perpetuity.

331
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:40,146
And if they if they say no always always always ask for a recommendation or lead somewhere else

332
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:45,931
Every single no can be turned into an introduction. I've gotten incredible results from that and

333
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:53,396
Also along with rejection you'll get used to a lot of rejection and getting anything signed will take a minimum from the first email

334
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:55,918
the first introduction email

335
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:59,400
to actually getting signed on, officially starting work.

336
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,624
On average, 30 days is the fastest I've ever seen happen.

337
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:06,585
Normally it's about 45 days.

338
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,747
So you'll have to be patient, you'll have to be,

339
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,628
I get used to hearing no a hell of a lot,

340
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:13,190
and you have to get used to sending a lot of emails

341
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,131
and following up constantly.

342
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:16,933
Again, that's the less fun part of it,

343
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,814
but when it works, it feels terrific.

344
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:24,645
and alongside sending emails, create an email template saying,

345
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,828
hello, I'm offering my services, blah, blah, blah.

346
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:30,150
Try and customize it for each person you send it to,

347
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,833
because it's really obvious that it's a template.

348
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,374
Always include a portfolio link.

349
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,315
Don't ask too much of them.

350
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,977
But just try and get on a regular and respectful cycle

351
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,999
of how often you send that and who, and keep track of that.

352
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,341
Because if you have to custom write it every time,

353
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,763
you'll learn to hate it much more than is necessary.

354
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:49,044
So try and save time and find ways

355
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:50,085
to streamline and optimize that.

356
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:58,315
So, cutting the tether in five acts. Preparation, discipline, security, marketing and

357
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:03,617
tenacity. So preparation. Decide. Are you going to be mobile or are you going to work from

358
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:10,320
home? By mobile I mean if you're traveling everywhere, if you're working out of coffee

359
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,002
shops or co‑working spaces. That is a very different hardware set up than you would have if

360
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:16,922
you were working from home.

361
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:22,111
You also need to buy all of your own equipment and you need to have a broad software proficiency.

362
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:28,528
So if you're deciding whether to be mobile or work from home, mobile is good for producers,

363
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:33,149
project managers and directors and for people that do work that involves travel. And if you

364
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,931
live in cool cities with lots of cafes and co‑working spaces. If you can do most of your

365
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:42,732
work off of a laptop or a phone, and if you're traveling around a lot, you're not going to want

366
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:48,194
to carry around 150 pounds worth of everything all the time. So be realistic about the power

367
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:48,594
of your spine.

368
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:53,633
Work at home is good for artists or developers with serious hardware needs,

369
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:57,220
for people developing for VR, and for parents that can work with minimal interruption.

370
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:01,150
So the importance of buying your own equipment.

371
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,590
So you're responsible ultimately for all of your hardware.

372
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,791
It's expensive but it's worth it for many reasons.

373
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,972
So first off, if you are contracting with a company,

374
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:12,453
so if you're introducing yourself to a company

375
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,413
that is not a former employer,

376
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:15,774
if you have your own equipment,

377
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,414
that is less of an equipment cost on them.

378
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:20,075
That's an immediate, basically an immediate savings

379
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,815
as soon as you start talking to them.

380
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,956
But in addition to that, if that contract ends

381
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:25,996
either expectedly or unexpectedly,

382
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,899
you don't have to give that hardware back because you provided everything for

383
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,040
yourself.

384
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,304
Find suddenly finding you've grown relied upon this like a massively beef

385
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:38,286
tacular PC that whatever client gave you and realizing, oh,

386
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:40,628
I have to give this back. Now I need to,

387
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:43,350
now I'm back to my old crappy PC that I didn't invest that much money into.

388
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,113
It's not a very good feeling.

389
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:50,316
So it's really deeply worthwhile to make sure that you have a consistent set of

390
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:54,820
hardware that you can use for anything that is 100% yours and no one has any

391
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,500
claim on but you.

392
00:21:56,639 --> 00:22:02,484
and really don't go cheap. But also don't think of this as the perfect time to massively

393
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:06,207
overspend on every weird little gadget you ever thought you would need. Because I've

394
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:10,410
done that. I have a lot of things that do and do not go into my go bag. And over the

395
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,994
course of time you realize I actually did not need that $750 whatever. Buy things you

396
00:22:14,994 --> 00:22:17,916
need as you need them.

397
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:23,379
don't skimp necessarily, but just be realistic about what you

398
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:25,179
really think you will be using on a day-to-day basis,

399
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:29,081
otherwise you'll waste a lot of money. And if you're a mobile

400
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,782
dev on the go, you're going to be really destroying your back

401
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:35,423
carrying around extra crud that you don't need. And you can also

402
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:37,904
deduct all these things on your taxes, which is really, really

403
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:38,164
nice.

404
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:46,094
and having a dedicated work machine is ideal. I'm very particular about partitioning off

405
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:52,139
personal things, personal projects and just like my average day to day use PC with my work PC.

406
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:56,583
The less commingling the better because when I'm at work I'm at work, when I'm at home I'm at

407
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,106
home and mixing the two is the fast track to insanity.

408
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:07,762
So broad software proficiency. You use whatever tools your clients use and never, ever,

409
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:13,706
ever mix work and personal accounts. Always have your own unique accounts on Google, Slack,

410
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:19,050
Trello, Skype, Dropbox, Box, OneDrive. Any professional tool that you use, create your own

411
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:24,074
special dedicated work only account for that. Ideally with a work related email address, a

412
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:29,618
personal email address that you own that is only for business matters.

413
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:33,259
because I've been in many situations where my clients have

414
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:36,560
given me an email address and say Trello for example. I had

415
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,841
not used that before I had a particular client and then when

416
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:42,781
that contract ended my log in credentials were tied to that

417
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,942
email address so I lost that account even though I had many

418
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:50,403
other personal Trello boards running off of that. That caught

419
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:53,144
me off guard and I realized that was a really stupid thing to do.

420
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:55,424
This is an account that I will use for a lot of different

421
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:58,105
things and all that should be run through my domain, through

422
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,085
my email address, through my unique account.

423
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:04,669
So whenever conceivably possible, have your own account for that and maintain control of it.

424
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,312
It's the same principle as owning all of your own hardware.

425
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:11,074
You know what you have to use, you know what your capabilities are,

426
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,276
and you know what you have access to at any given point,

427
00:24:13,276 --> 00:24:15,838
and no external force can take that away from you.

428
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:20,101
And that builds a sense of confidence and reliability.

429
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,303
And just not having to worry about, you know,

430
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:25,346
this contract ends, so I'm not going to have access to this tool anymore.

431
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:26,687
It's unnecessary mental overhead.

432
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:29,269
Own all your own stuff, all your own accounts.

433
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:36,483
and pay for and license all of your own software. A lot of the common tools they use are

434
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:41,128
remote worker, perforce, Gera, base camp, Trello, hand soft, SVN. Gain at least a

435
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:45,512
passive familiarity with these even if it's just signing up for a trial account. Just do

436
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:51,698
whatever you can to know enough about it to be able to jump in really quickly if you're

437
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,499
asked because

438
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,084
different company has a completely different set of tools that they use and the more

439
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:02,327
familiar you are with each of those, the better selling point that is. So if you're the

440
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:05,869
person that has at least a little bit of knowledge about absolutely everything, it's a lot

441
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:09,832
easier to work your way toward a yes, we'll sign you on, let's have you start working

442
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:18,939
remotely. Discipline. So ubiquity, work space, responsiveness and disaster readiness.

443
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,339
So ubiquity. Use the services your clients use. As I said

444
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,159
before, oh, you use this app? I'm already on it. Here's my

445
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,380
work account info. Here invite me into your GitHub repo.

446
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,221
Integrate with the team and the tools where they work and never

447
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:36,281
ever ask a client to sign up for anything. You have to adapt to

448
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:41,342
them in whatever they are using and it is up to you to be a

449
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:44,683
tools expert and to be extremely adaptable to whatever they

450
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:47,184
happen to throw at you. Because you will see everything and you

451
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:48,264
never want to be caught out of your depth.

452
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:53,318
Inevitably, you will be, but if you act confident about it and you've done at least a bit of

453
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:57,022
preparation working with these tools, it's much more likely you'll present yourself as

454
00:25:57,022 --> 00:26:02,027
confident to the client, or prospective client, and you're that much closer to a yes and that

455
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,709
much closer to retaining them as a client.

456
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,611
So you have to establish a powerful, reliable remote presence to build their trust in you.

457
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:12,053
And the best possible place to do that is inside the tools where they already exist and

458
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:18,436
already work. Slack has been a boon in the past couple of years for me because it's IRC for

459
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:24,158
work. People chat in all the day. They have the random channels, but they have the

460
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:27,840
discipline-specific channels for our production, for AI, for programming, for level design.

461
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,363
for general discussion. That's where if organizations that use Slack well and

462
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:33,183
correctly

463
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:36,325
are really easy to like to work your way into because you can be physically

464
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:36,766
present,

465
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:40,849
well virtually present in all the chats that they have and in that particular

466
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,669
interface

467
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:44,751
you are no different from anybody that's working inside the four

468
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:46,212
walls of that studio.

469
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:49,755
That is the most even ground you're possible to have with them and

470
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,296
you need to take maximum advantage of that.

471
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:57,321
don't goof off all the time, but just make sure that you're there and present and that your

472
00:26:57,321 --> 00:27:03,145
name, actually this is a little trick I learned recently. Make sure that your user name in

473
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:06,928
slack follows the same naming conventions as everybody else in slack for if they're tagging

474
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:11,992
their name. So if it's first initial last name or just first name, make your name that so they

475
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:15,715
can tag you just as easily as anybody else at the studio and you're that much easier to

476
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:18,017
contact and tag in the conversations.

477
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:21,944
and you're just a little bit more integrated with everything they do.

478
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:25,471
The less friction there is with dealing with you and talking to you externally,

479
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:28,677
the easier you are to work with, the more likely you are to retain them as a client.

480
00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:30,881
Any tiny advantage you can find, you should take it.

481
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:36,549
So your work space, set aside a dedicated work space and do not

482
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:39,712
work and play in the same area. Ultimately that's purgatory.

483
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:43,575
You're never completely at work, you're never completely at play.

484
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:45,437
If you're trying to relax, you're going to feel obligated

485
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:48,620
to log in, like, sync down to the latest Perforce build or

486
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,882
catch up on e-mails or see what else you can do.

487
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:55,404
and you'll feel a little bit guilty for not catching up on this or that.

488
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:58,345
And conversely, if you're working in a place where you play,

489
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,085
you're going to be tempted to go on Reddit, to dink around on Twitter,

490
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:02,626
to play a game.

491
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:08,488
So you're never completely at work because you're always tempted to play.

492
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:11,909
And it's a very strange place to be,

493
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:16,331
so that's why I recommend having a completely physically distinct,

494
00:28:16,331 --> 00:28:18,751
separate place in which you work and you only work.

495
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:25,895
When I started my company I was renting a 650 square foot apartment and the entire bedroom was my office

496
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:27,936
I had a bed in my living room

497
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:33,699
That gave me you can you can write off the amount of square footage on your taxes

498
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:38,702
For the space you work in with at your home, which was you know really convenient, but more than anything

499
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:42,404
I only worked in that space, and I worked primarily off a laptop when I'm at work

500
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:47,886
I'm on the laptop in the room where I work and I'm focused on that. When I'm off work, I unplug

501
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:53,789
the laptop, I go into the living room and that is where I play. Never co-mingle. So having that

502
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:58,931
physically different environment is really important. And that can also apply to a cafe, for

503
00:28:58,931 --> 00:29:00,212
example, or a co-working space.

504
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:06,743
And having your physical surroundings encouraging you to work and focus on whatever you need to do is really important.

505
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:13,656
And if you start out doing that, you will avoid a lot of the issues that a lot of first-time remote workers and freelancers would have otherwise.

506
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:20,350
and remove attention distracting items from your work space. Like those little physics

507
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,270
balls where you pull it back and it clacks back and forth. Just any kind of weird tactile

508
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,412
little distracting thing like a Nintendo DS on your desk. Remove anything distracting and

509
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:34,732
have it be a dedicated focused place for work. Because you're already having to compensate so

510
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:39,153
much for your remote presence and force projecting yourself and practicing your

511
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:43,154
telepresence that anything that can detract from that should just go away.

512
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:47,251
and establish work time boundaries with family.

513
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:49,013
This is a big one I've seen a lot.

514
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,356
You can't work remotely with constant distraction

515
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,359
and mismanaging this weakens both work

516
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,181
and family relationships.

517
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,104
Like if your kids are always running into the room

518
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:58,386
and you're always playing with them

519
00:29:58,386 --> 00:30:00,088
and you're getting distracted every five to 10 minutes,

520
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:00,228
how...

521
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,493
you're not going to be producing your most high-quality work, and you have to find a way to

522
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:10,534
partition out your time so you're respecting your client, but also being the parent that you

523
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:16,636
need to be. And this is unique for every person in the situation, but the work at home

524
00:30:16,636 --> 00:30:20,677
parents, this is a very common thing that I hear. You need to learn to put up those

525
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:23,758
boundaries, because it's really, really convenient to go, like, oh, yeah, let's go play

526
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:28,300
out in the backyard. It's something worth paying attention to.

527
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:31,635
And also, if you say yes to every single contract

528
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:33,096
and opportunity that comes your way,

529
00:30:33,096 --> 00:30:34,177
you'll quickly hate your life

530
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:35,618
because you have no time for your family,

531
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:37,220
you feel like you're always at work,

532
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,301
and you'll begin to resent the entire institution

533
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:40,903
of working remotely.

534
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:44,346
And ultimately, everyone I know has made this mistake,

535
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:45,587
they've overcommitted themselves,

536
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:48,549
and they've had to learn from that, sometimes painfully.

537
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:51,151
But at a certain point, after about maybe a year or two,

538
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,732
you know what you're capable of,

539
00:30:52,732 --> 00:30:55,815
you know how to manage your time between work and family,

540
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:57,416
and you're not afraid to say no.

541
00:30:58,097 --> 00:31:02,761
Because it's natural if you're sending out 100 emails a week trying to get somebody to say yes to you,

542
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:08,527
saying no back can be a little bit daunting because you know the very, very low yield of yeses to noes that you get.

543
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:13,673
But at a certain point for mental health and time management and family, you really have to.

544
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,215
Responsiveness, always respond quickly and follow up

545
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:19,577
when you say you will.

546
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,382
Being able to make a commitment and then keep it,

547
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,285
even if it's just saying, hey, I will call you at 2.15.

548
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:27,029
If you can do that consistently,

549
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,994
that is a massive confidence builder in your client.

550
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:34,578
and just being able to say that you're going to do something and then not following up on it,

551
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:38,661
they may not tell you that they were disappointed or they noticed.

552
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:41,363
That's entirely possible. They may not even notice at all.

553
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:47,168
But over a long enough period of time, your word is your bond. And if you're not able to

554
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:51,612
meet even minimally consistent things like that, it's going to be a much more difficult

555
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:54,514
relationship working remotely. And they're not going to be able to trust you to do what

556
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:57,856
you're going to say you do for large things if you can't do it for small things.

557
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:03,708
and always communicate in the channels they expect like in slack or perforce or whatever

558
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:09,493
systems your particular client uses. And show up early and dress well for remote meetings. I

559
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:15,319
learned a fairly embarrassing lesson when I was working ‑‑ so I worked with Epic Games for a

560
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:19,423
year running the Unreal Engine marketplace and I worked on site in North Carolina for one week a

561
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:21,004
month but the rest of the time was in Brooklyn.

562
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:25,407
and the very first meeting, video conference I had with Tim Sweeney from my home in Brooklyn,

563
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:29,570
I was unfortunately wearing a tan shirt, so it looked like I showed up shirtless for a meeting

564
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,794
with Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic. That was a very humbling and instructive moment, so be

565
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:42,239
aware of how things look on camera and try to dress it up a little bit. Oh, that still stings.

566
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:47,892
And remote work on an ongoing basis is earned.

567
00:32:47,892 --> 00:32:50,435
When you're working on-site, attendance means

568
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,716
I see that seat is full.

569
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:54,019
When you're working off-site, attendance means

570
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,362
they consistently respond to us quickly.

571
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:58,905
In consistency and reliability,

572
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:00,807
I keep pushing that as much as possible.

573
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,151
The expectations are so different of on-site versus off-site and this is one of the better

574
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,492
examples I can think of it.

575
00:33:07,492 --> 00:33:11,214
Just always be responding quickly, even if you're not giving them necessarily the answer

576
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:11,654
they want.

577
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:16,157
Just being able to say, hey, I hear you, I'm in the middle of something else, I'll respond

578
00:33:16,157 --> 00:33:16,817
at this time.

579
00:33:16,817 --> 00:33:22,100
That is better than not saying anything and then responding two hours later with what

580
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,020
they need.

581
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,363
Just acknowledgement rather than fulfillment or delivery is key.

582
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:36,037
disaster readiness. So realistic scenarios to plan for are power outages, internet self‑

583
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:41,022
service outages, hard drive crashes, stolen hard drive or laptop, hospital or family

584
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:43,304
emergency or nonspecific hardware failure.

585
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,423
find out, just plan out what you do in each of these cases. At

586
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:53,206
home do you have universal power supply? If you're working off of

587
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:56,988
a laptop and you work on a mobile basis, where is the

588
00:33:56,988 --> 00:34:00,091
nearest internet cafe where you can get back online if your

589
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:03,613
connectivity drops? If you are working from home, your internet

590
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:05,734
goes down and there is a critical delivery,

591
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:12,500
do you have a cellular modem. Verizon has what's called the jet pack which is a pay as you go

592
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:19,947
cellular modem which is extremely convenient. It's 4G LTE speeds. It's fairly expensive on a

593
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:24,872
pay as you go basis but if you absolutely need internet access and you have to make a delivery,

594
00:34:24,872 --> 00:34:28,595
that's a convenient thing to have in your back pocket. Literally, they're very small.

595
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:33,841
You can get one for anywhere from $125 to $175, no contract, and then just pay as you go as

596
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,523
you use the data. I have found that it's...

597
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:43,791
So my clients know that I have that. I've only had to use it in a handful of cases, but it's

598
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:48,295
always been kind of a nice bullet point to say, hey, here's my backup. Rarely used, but

599
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:54,902
it's here if you need it. So sometimes a sale is made not on ‑‑ you can sell somebody on

600
00:34:54,902 --> 00:34:59,987
like a service or a feature like that that is never really used. That's what leads to a yes,

601
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:03,110
even if it's never actually exercised in practice. And that's just a nice thing to have

602
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,330
around.

603
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:09,007
for a hard drive crash, since you're responsible for your hardware, do you do regular

604
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:13,390
backups? Do you have web-based backups? Where are those files if things fail

605
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:18,713
catastrophically on your side? Again, in your studio's IT, this is the kind of thing that's

606
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:22,655
taken care of for you. This is now something that you're responsible for and have to plan for in

607
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:27,938
advance. If your hard drive or laptop are stolen, were they encrypted? Were they

608
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:30,960
passworded? Can you track them remotely? Can you disable them?

609
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:35,975
these are things you have to plan for. If there's a hospital or family emergency, it might

610
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:41,118
help to have an e-mail template set up in advance, like in a draft folder to your bosses or

611
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:47,001
whoever would need to know if you're out. So as you're on your way to the hospital or

612
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:51,003
something, you can pull out your phone, hit send on that draft and then have that be

613
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:54,564
essentially taken care of instead of people wondering where you are. Ultimately they'll be

614
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:59,287
understanding, but if emergencies like that happen, it's a convenient thing to have.

615
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:07,149
to have in place so they can know and plan for it. So security. I did another talk on this

616
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:11,670
called tools and tech of the globe trotting freelancer. I go into a lot of detail on this

617
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:18,031
and I will not do that today. But ultimately encrypt your hard drives like in windows use

618
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:24,352
bit locker for Mac, use file vault for USB drives, use Vera crypt, it's a fork of true crypt.

619
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:29,319
essentially creates encrypted passworded container so if you

620
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,184
lose a thumb drive or someone steals it from you, they'll see

621
00:36:33,184 --> 00:36:35,267
just a big lump of file they cannot open without the

622
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,632
password. Never leave any client data up to chance. Treat it as

623
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:40,234
though it's more valuable than your own.

624
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:46,083
use a password manager. I like last pass, one pass and key pass

625
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:49,083
are also very good. If you're using the internet today and

626
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,704
you're not using a password manager with unique passwords

627
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:56,785
for every website, you are using the internet wrong. And just

628
00:36:56,785 --> 00:37:00,526
very bluntly, you're using it wrong. And if you have your

629
00:37:00,526 --> 00:37:03,367
logins to your various client sites, you're not using unique

630
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:06,687
passwords with them and you're not taking care of all that

631
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:08,948
inside a password manager, you're putting your client's

632
00:37:08,948 --> 00:37:11,088
data at risk and you're being irresponsible.

633
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,132
If for nothing else, use a password manager for your

634
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,614
client's data. It's very little extra effort to do it for

635
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:21,598
yourself. But think of your clients. Two-factor

636
00:37:21,598 --> 00:37:26,002
authentication on everything. It's the same basis. So

637
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:28,665
essentially two-factor authentication is a way, let's

638
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,608
say you're logging into Google. It wants you to prove you are

639
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:33,970
who you say you are. And the easiest way to prove that is to

640
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,011
send a message to your phone.

641
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:40,307
So we'll do it either via SMS or by constantly rotating code.

642
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:43,128
Say, OK, enter these six digits to prove that you are you and

643
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:46,269
you're in physical possession of your phone before granting

644
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:47,830
access to your account.

645
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,591
Dozens and dozens of websites, especially business focused

646
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:52,911
tools, offer two-factor authentication.

647
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:55,312
And you should enable that for every single one of them,

648
00:37:55,312 --> 00:37:56,733
especially for your client.

649
00:37:57,593 --> 00:38:03,019
any log in that you can find on 2TWOfactoroff.org. It's a

650
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:07,484
comprehensive list of every service that offers two factor

651
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:10,187
authentication. Sign up for every single one, especially your

652
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,070
client sites. Because, frankly,

653
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,732
My clients have never pressed me particularly hard on security, but it's one of the things

654
00:38:16,732 --> 00:38:22,015
that I push forward showing I care about your data, I care about your project, and I take

655
00:38:22,015 --> 00:38:27,758
great, I take extreme measures to make sure that your data is protected no matter what

656
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:32,700
happens, whether it's a data breach, whether it's a big password dump, whether my hardware

657
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:37,163
is physically stolen, your data is safe and these are the precautions that I take. Again,

658
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:40,827
It's never really been something that a particular client

659
00:38:40,827 --> 00:38:44,094
has exercised, but it's a part of my sales pitch

660
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:47,280
and it's appealing and generally it's just good

661
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,786
computer hygiene and you should do it.

662
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:55,267
and also use a virtual private network any time you connect to a Wi‑Fi hotspot that you do not

663
00:38:55,267 --> 00:39:05,057
own. So any non‑HTTPS connection on a Wi‑Fi hotspot like here at GDC 17, that's visible in

664
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:08,960
plain text. You can collect passwords, you can collect user names, you can collect every site

665
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,881
the person has visited.

666
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:14,665
on my phone I'm able to map out all the different devices that are connected to this WiFi

667
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:20,810
hotspot for GDC and there are over 2500 of them and dozens of your computers have your

668
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:26,034
full names on them or your user names. I was able to very easily find people online who

669
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:29,377
are at GDC based on what they named their mobile devices or laptops.

670
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:33,198
and it would be trivial to snoop on their traffic.

671
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:34,738
Using a virtual private network

672
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,139
that encrypts all of your traffic

673
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,899
when you're connected to a public Wi-Fi hotspot

674
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:42,700
and that also protects you and protects your client

675
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,201
and anytime your connection is not encrypted with HTTPS

676
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:49,022
and you're not connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot

677
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:50,302
that you own or trust,

678
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:52,803
you're putting all of that at risk.

679
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:54,363
I recommend Air VPN.

680
00:39:55,123 --> 00:40:00,105
private Internet access or Weetopia for VPN. It's anywhere from $2.99 to $4.99 a month.

681
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:05,846
It's very cheap, very easy, works on mobile devices and again this is just decent data

682
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:10,387
hygiene. So, marketing. You need a professional website, a LinkedIn, and you need to be

683
00:40:10,387 --> 00:40:18,248
networking and you need to be constantly engaged in publicity for yourself.

684
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,053
So your professional website, if at all possible use your real

685
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,955
name or a new company name. It should be short, easy to

686
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,057
remember, professional and able to be spoken aloud in a way

687
00:40:28,057 --> 00:40:31,219
that people are able to easily understand. Get the dot com or

688
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:35,262
the dot net. Avoid weird top level domains like dot biz, dot

689
00:40:35,262 --> 00:40:37,784
radio, dot triple X unless you're a very different kind of

690
00:40:37,784 --> 00:40:38,265
contractor.

691
00:40:40,395 --> 00:40:45,897
Summarize your services using 3 to 5 bullet points. Ask friends for input. Wordpress is

692
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:50,978
notoriously insecure but if you're just having a very simple public facing website, they're

693
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:56,800
very simple, easy to use, easy to set up, free professional looking themes to present

694
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,482
yourself professionally. And if you're providing professional services, you absolutely should

695
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,663
have at least a website with your name on it that can prove you are who you say you

696
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:05,723
are.

697
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:09,684
I'll also list prominent projects and employers, but only

698
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:14,085
list roles where you did what you were selling. So LinkedIn,

699
00:41:14,085 --> 00:41:17,186
part one. Being on LinkedIn is not optional. It's a top

700
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,567
business networking site in the world. It's the first place

701
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:21,828
people with money will look you up. And if you don't have a

702
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:25,049
LinkedIn presence, you look risky and unprofessional.

703
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,290
Generally speaking, it's a good idea to be in the first place

704
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,731
people with money to give to you will look to find out if you

705
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:33,851
are qualified to give money to.

706
00:41:34,936 --> 00:41:37,660
And that is essentially the beginning and the end

707
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,002
of the argument for LinkedIn.

708
00:41:39,002 --> 00:41:40,824
Like, be there, be professional,

709
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:43,107
maintain it every few months.

710
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:44,269
It takes very little effort,

711
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,691
but it's absolutely important that you're on there.

712
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:48,196
and polish up your presence.

713
00:41:48,196 --> 00:41:50,337
Update your roles and descriptions, spell check,

714
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:52,958
use the proper tense, present tense, past tense,

715
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,619
give and request recommendations.

716
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,420
And this is an important one that I've not really seen

717
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,920
other people touch on before.

718
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,402
Add projects and link to your coworkers on those projects.

719
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:05,663
So let's say a game is shipped or there's a layoff.

720
00:42:06,627 --> 00:42:10,049
If you add those projects on LinkedIn and add your coworkers on LinkedIn,

721
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:13,791
you're much easier to discover for potential work or being hired as a team or for

722
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,013
freelancing if you're associated with that. So if you're connected to, you know,

723
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:20,615
five coworkers away, it's like, Oh, this coworker is an engineer. Uh,

724
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:21,995
who else are you working that with? Oh,

725
00:42:21,995 --> 00:42:25,617
I'm actually looking for artists and they're able to find you through that path

726
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:28,359
of discovery because you're associated with that project or with that event.

727
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,900
It makes it a lot easier for good things to come to you.

728
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,762
And if you were not already on LinkedIn and you weren't connected to their

729
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:35,883
projects, they would never have found you otherwise.

730
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:39,706
This is a very simple way to establish a passive presence.

731
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:45,151
Part two, connect to your coworkers. Not during a layoff.

732
00:42:45,151 --> 00:42:48,534
That's when everybody realizes oh, crap, I haven't updated

733
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:52,298
LinkedIn since I got this job. That's actually a really easy

734
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:55,381
way to spot layoffs. When everybody from one company is

735
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:57,823
connecting to each other all at once and flooding your LinkedIn

736
00:42:57,823 --> 00:42:59,224
feed with it.

737
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:05,393
I've discovered layoffs that way. Add them before you need it. As you meet someone and

738
00:43:05,393 --> 00:43:12,002
work them out, at work or for a client, add them whenever, like at the earliest possible

739
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:16,909
point. Just before it seems like you're just trying to get something out of them.

740
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:20,992
Also, connect to recruiters because this expands your network reach.

741
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:24,594
It's easier for people to find you through recruiters who are naturally going to be connected

742
00:43:24,594 --> 00:43:26,335
to everybody on LinkedIn.

743
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,637
This also passively increases your discoverability.

744
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:31,478
Join relevant LinkedIn user groups.

745
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:35,800
You can use a group affiliation as one of the reasons to connect to someone on LinkedIn

746
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,241
when you send them a connection request.

747
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:40,063
The more of those you have in common, the easier it is for you to reach people that

748
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:41,163
may otherwise be unreachable.

749
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,051
Get in the habit of cold emailing and introducing yourself.

750
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:46,992
Do not be shy, rip off the band aid.

751
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,292
You must be constantly communicating and networking.

752
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:52,733
Don't stop doing it just because you secured a client

753
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:53,474
in the near term.

754
00:43:53,474 --> 00:43:56,274
Always, always, always be networking,

755
00:43:56,274 --> 00:43:58,415
be reaching out and be practicing.

756
00:43:58,415 --> 00:44:02,156
And just follow general industry goings on with LinkedIn.

757
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,637
Networking, attend trade shows constantly.

758
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:07,398
GDC is the highest value in my experience, wink.

759
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:14,388
Also, XDS, E3, gamescom, packs, steam dev days, look up and join local game dev user

760
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:19,455
groups, attend meetups, game jams, workshops, game nights, beer nights, drink ups, job fairs,

761
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,860
anywhere there are developers in your area. If you're working remotely,

762
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:27,244
can get really, really lonely just for one thing. But being

763
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:32,348
able to go out and hang out with other developers is not just for

764
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:36,372
networking and potentially finding work locally. It's just

765
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:38,854
good to be around other devs to remember what it's like and be

766
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:41,076
able to share war stories and be able to feel part of the

767
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:45,740
community. It's important for sanity. And always have business

768
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,842
cards ready. I recommend Zazzle and Moo. They have great

769
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:50,263
quality cards, very good designs.

770
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:56,636
I should put a referral code up there. Man, opportunity missed. So publicity. Publish

771
00:44:56,636 --> 00:45:00,157
articles in your area of focus. Publish on your site and cross publish to LinkedIn.

772
00:45:00,157 --> 00:45:03,598
LinkedIn is desperate to be a publishing platform and they promote the hell out of

773
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:07,239
anybody that will publish something on their site. They'll promote that to the top of

774
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:10,879
your feed to anybody you're connected to, which is yet another good reason to connect

775
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:16,781
to people before you need them. Also, apply to speak at industry events. And local IGDA

776
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,361
chapters are a great place to start.

777
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:21,384
Publish original content frequently on your blog or on

778
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:27,287
Gamasutra or LinkedIn. Do Reddit AMA, do Twitter Q&A's, be part

779
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:30,048
of Screenshot Saturday if you're working on cool stuff. Twitter

780
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:33,829
is an amazing way to reach out to people. Request guest spots

781
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:36,730
on industry podcasts, get involved in that community. The

782
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,952
more broadly present you are in these communities, the easier it

783
00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:42,193
is to find you. The more likely it is you'll be able to find

784
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:42,593
paying work.

785
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:51,202
Tenacity, constant biz dev, taxes and expenses and cabin fever. This is the fun part. So

786
00:45:51,202 --> 00:45:55,885
constant biz dev, at least 40 to 50 percent of your time will be doing biz dev. That's just

787
00:45:55,885 --> 00:46:00,609
the sad truth of it. And the sooner you can get used to that and automate it or try to make it

788
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:04,052
fun, the better. But that's just going to be a part of your life from now on. Always be

789
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:09,976
networking, always be selling, but don't be a dweeb about it. Just be like, hi, it's nice to

790
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,378
meet you. My name is such and such. Do you have a job for me?

791
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:14,740
Don't be that person.

792
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,902
Be the person that's cool, that attends events,

793
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,724
that people like hanging out with,

794
00:46:18,724 --> 00:46:20,165
and don't try and find a way to bring

795
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:22,167
the conversation around to yourself.

796
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:25,470
Be that presence and don't push for a result.

797
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,032
Ultimately good things will come to you,

798
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:28,513
but also don't be too shy.

799
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:31,817
It's a balance, but it's worth trying to find.

800
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:35,441
always remember, you work to secure next month's income, not

801
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:37,985
this month's. So if you're getting paid this month, that's

802
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:40,628
fantastic. Where's next month's coming from? Always be doing

803
00:46:40,628 --> 00:46:43,672
business, always be pushing, always be trying. And when

804
00:46:43,672 --> 00:46:46,957
you're employed, all this is invisible to you. Respect your

805
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:49,500
company's founders, admin, finance, legal and IT.

806
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:53,581
So you're in customer service now.

807
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:56,324
Retaining clients means ongoing customer service.

808
00:46:56,324 --> 00:46:58,947
And understand what doing a good job means

809
00:46:58,947 --> 00:46:59,628
on a per-client basis.

810
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:01,930
They may define it differently.

811
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,333
Be explicit because only their opinion matters.

812
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:06,676
You may think you're knocking it absolutely out of the park

813
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:08,318
but their expectations are completely different.

814
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:11,860
and they may perceive you as being underperforming.

815
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,601
That's why you have to go out of your way

816
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:16,202
to reach out above and beyond what you would do

817
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:17,543
if you were working on site.

818
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,704
Find out if you actually are meeting their expectations

819
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,785
and find out if they actually are

820
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,567
communicating those back to you.

821
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:25,788
It is your responsibility to reach out and pull

822
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:26,728
and get that information.

823
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:33,283
and how to retain clients. Be responsive, aware, present and

824
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:37,125
always check in. Always be where they look first. Keep in touch

825
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:40,166
with old clients. Manage your time wisely. Don't get greedy.

826
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:43,868
Like your shiny new gig is tempting but serve your existing

827
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:46,910
client well. Just be realistic about what you're realistically

828
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:49,831
able to accomplish and don't take on too much too soon.

829
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:52,753
People find this out over time. Everybody makes the mistake.

830
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:56,988
Taxes and expenses, hooray, best slide.

831
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:58,710
Work with an accountant from day one.

832
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,031
Do everything they say.

833
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:01,532
Remember, taxes are no longer withheld.

834
00:48:01,532 --> 00:48:04,455
You need to be saving at least half of whatever you bring in.

835
00:48:04,455 --> 00:48:06,397
Start a tax savings account for paying taxes

836
00:48:06,397 --> 00:48:08,599
and immediately deposit half of every check in that

837
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,583
and do everything your tax professional says from day one.

838
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:14,044
This will lead to pain.

839
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:17,567
Be smart, get a tax pro, pay them to do the thing

840
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,449
that you will undoubtedly hate doing.

841
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:22,947
Also, be frugal and focus on savings.

842
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:24,949
Plan for lean times, budget for disasters.

843
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:27,451
Target six months of savings in the bank

844
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,293
in case anything goes wrong.

845
00:48:29,293 --> 00:48:30,995
Not many people I know actually have that

846
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,616
and have all that saved up

847
00:48:32,616 --> 00:48:34,098
when they're starting out working remotely,

848
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:37,081
but this is something worth moving toward

849
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,522
and that is something to aspire toward.

850
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:43,153
And finally cabin fever. A dedicated work space as I

851
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:46,195
mentioned before helps you focus. Get plenty of exercise

852
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:48,876
in sunlight. If all you do is stay inside all the time,

853
00:48:48,876 --> 00:48:52,118
eventually it will turn into a pale sickly little thing that is

854
00:48:52,118 --> 00:48:56,320
practically transparent. I had a two or three month stretch where

855
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,902
I realized I was starting to resemble like a mole rat that

856
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:02,164
doesn't see the sun. My eyes were, yeah.

857
00:49:03,224 --> 00:49:10,551
It's an unpleasant place to be and I have an extraordinarily patient wife that would sponge me off.

858
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:14,294
So, create healthy... Oh man, I said that.

859
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:21,340
Create healthy daily rituals. Do yoga, walk your dog, cook for yourself, take language lessons, develop a new hobby.

860
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,384
Do something that is not your job to expand yourself, expand your horizons

861
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:29,727
and to be able to mentally switch focus to something completely different.

862
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,748
it's really important to maintain a well-rounded,

863
00:49:32,748 --> 00:49:34,569
well-balanced life, because otherwise,

864
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:36,090
work can become your life,

865
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,271
and you have to force yourself away from it

866
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:39,792
to be able to remember to be a human again,

867
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,532
to have a third dimension to you,

868
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:44,054
instead of just that sweaty, pale thing

869
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:45,174
that's at the computer all the time.

870
00:49:46,657 --> 00:49:49,698
and maintain a strict separation of work and life.

871
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,618
If you let it, it can absolutely consume you

872
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:53,059
all hours of the day and night.

873
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:54,679
You really need to clamp down on that

874
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:57,640
and just be realistic about, you know,

875
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,060
what do you value most in your life?

876
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,241
Like yourself, your health, your family,

877
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:02,762
your relationships, your career.

878
00:50:02,762 --> 00:50:05,523
Like there's, you know, that famous example.

879
00:50:05,523 --> 00:50:07,243
Has anyone on their deathbed ever said,

880
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:08,423
I wish I spent more time at work?

881
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:12,650
just realistically, just be good to yourself,

882
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,031
be honest with what you really want

883
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:15,891
and maintain that separation of work and life

884
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,932
because it really can consume you if you're not careful.

885
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,773
And that's all, thank you very much for listening.

886
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:22,214
Does anyone have any questions?
