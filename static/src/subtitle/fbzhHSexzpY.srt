00:00:06,515 --> 00:00:11,436
OK, so today I'm going to talk to you about how I got my mom to play through Plants vs. Zombies.

2
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:18,117
And who am I? I'm George Fan, I like my steak well done, and my Magic card's rare.

3
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:25,239
And I'm the creator of Plants vs. Zombies. Thanks.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,680
So this is my mom.

5
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:35,668
She's a non-gamer. In fact, I think the only game

6
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,310
she might have beaten is Plants vs. Zombies.

7
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:43,073
Her favorite food is lettuce. I once asked my

8
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:44,894
mom, hey mom, what's your favorite food? And she

9
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:47,215
said, lettuce. And I said, really? You could choose

10
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:48,676
any food in the world and you'd pick lettuce?

11
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:51,198
She said, yes. So that's my mom.

12
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,880
And she's destroyed quite a fair share of zombies

13
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,461
in her lifetime.

14
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,452
because, as you know, you kind of have to

15
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,493
do that to get through Plants vs. Zombies, which

16
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:04,935
is awesome because prior to playing PvZ, my mom's

17
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:07,176
idea of what zombies was was totally different from

18
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:07,856
everyone else's.

19
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,678
You see, before my mom started playing Plants vs.

20
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:13,259
Zombies, she was watching my dad play, and at

21
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,060
some point she apparently asked my dad, why are

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,921
you killing old men?

23
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:21,963
So, I don't know.

24
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:22,603
I just, I

25
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:23,744
just really liked that for a moment.

26
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,345
My mom thought that her son had made a

27
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,305
game about killing old men.

28
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,746
And in case there's any confusion whatsoever,

29
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:32,247
Plants vs. Zombies is not a game about killing old men.

30
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:36,709
So anyway, how did I turn my mom into a zombie destroyer?

31
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,871
There are many things that contributed to my mom's

32
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,172
beating of Plants vs. Zombies.

33
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:44,193
You got strategy, pacing, you got game balance,

34
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,994
consistent rewards, and unit design.

35
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,875
But if the tutorial hadn't been done well,

36
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,136
and she couldn't learn the game.

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,421
then all the time spent crafting the other elements of the game

38
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,501
wouldn't have mattered in terms of getting my mom to play through.

39
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:58,882
So today, I'm going to focus on talking about PVZ's tutorial.

40
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,042
The other stuff's all very interesting too,

41
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,943
but that's for perhaps another time.

42
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,843
So why did I choose this topic?

43
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:08,504
Well, as game designers, everyone has something

44
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:11,145
that they're passionate about or spend a lot of brain cycles on.

45
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:14,865
And I do think a lot about simplicity and accessibility,

46
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,366
and tutorials kind of go hand in hand with that.

47
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,918
So why is a tutorial important?

48
00:02:21,218 --> 00:02:22,879
Well, it's because it's what gets a player

49
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:23,840
into the meat of your game.

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,341
A player is not going to enjoy minute 30 of your game

51
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,182
if they don't get past the first five.

52
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,323
And they're not going to get past the first five

53
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:31,643
if they don't know how to play your game.

54
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:33,704
That's why it's so utterly important,

55
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,865
especially for games that feature new game mechanics,

56
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:38,847
to teach the player in an intuitive and enjoyable way.

57
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,288
I spent an enormous amount of time thinking

58
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,769
about how to make Plants vs. Zombies playable by anyone.

59
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:48,104
So it's, and it's no small feat because as you know, it's a strategy game at its core

60
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:49,884
and it can get pretty complex.

61
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:57,006
So I felt like my mission was definitely accomplished when my mom, who like I said, barely plays

62
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:59,866
any games, told me that she'd beaten the entire thing.

63
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:05,427
So today I'd like to share with you some of the techniques I come up with and give you

64
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:10,588
a glimpse on how I like to teach game mechanics to players and using my most recently designed

65
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,729
game, Plants vs. Zombies, as a source of examples.

66
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:14,069
So here we go.

67
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:20,091
10 tips for making your tutorials better, also known as a tutorial on tutorials.

68
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:26,537
Okay, first tip. You want to blend the tutorial in the game. So we're going to strive to make it

69
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:32,123
not feel like a tutorial at all. You see, when most people think of learning, they think of

70
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:37,209
something like this picture here, which for most people isn't fun and is kind of a lot like work.

71
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,732
which is why doing something like this for your main menu,

72
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:42,973
which clearly separates the tutorial from the game,

73
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,113
tends to be bad.

74
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,254
Do you see how unfun that second option looks?

75
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,035
You might as well put this on your main menu.

76
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,476
You might as well put this on your main menu

77
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:52,836
if you're gonna say tutorial.

78
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,657
So that's why I go to great measures

79
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:57,118
to make sure I don't have any sections in my game

80
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:58,278
actually labeled tutorial.

81
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,078
The weird thing is games are kind of all about

82
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:04,100
learning. I mean, you're discovering new techniques and adapting to

83
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,622
new challenges. Games stop being fun once you've figured everything

84
00:04:07,722 --> 00:04:09,503
out. And they stop being fun once you stop

85
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:09,803
learning.

86
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,685
So OK. So humans like learning, and learning is

87
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:16,567
inherently fun. But most humans don't know they like learning,

88
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:19,009
and that's why we must trick them. We have

89
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,010
to make the player think they're playing the game

90
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,031
and not the tutorial. There should be no indication

91
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:25,732
of where the tutorial ends and where the game

92
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:26,093
begins.

93
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:29,444
So here's an example of a bad tutorial.

94
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,905
First of all, it says tutorial in big fat letters.

95
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,486
Then notice the one out of six on the bottom.

96
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,827
That's six pages of info, probably five of which

97
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:40,127
is irrelevant at the start of the game.

98
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,268
And with this tutorial here, there's

99
00:04:42,308 --> 00:04:45,069
definitely a distinction between where the tutorial ends

100
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:45,989
and where the game begins.

101
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,950
It's kind of the virtual equivalent of this.

102
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,370
Remember when this was all we had to go off of.

103
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,291
And nowadays, we can seamlessly blend

104
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:54,291
the tutorial into the game.

105
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,131
So why don't we?

106
00:04:56,802 --> 00:05:00,623
Someone once said to me that they felt like the main mode of PvZ was kind of like a really

107
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:02,584
long tutorial for the other modes in the game.

108
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:04,185
That's a pretty good compliment.

109
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:08,747
And even better compliment would be if I asked someone, hey, what did you think of the tutorial

110
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:09,448
in PvZ?

111
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,769
And the reply was, that game had a tutorial?

112
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:15,370
I feel like it's what we should all strive for.

113
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:20,133
And to help you remember, I created this character, the Tutorial Chameleon, to help drive the

114
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:20,593
point home.

115
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,534
So let's all remember the Tutorial Chameleon.

116
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,119
Because that's what really the overarching theme of this presentation is about,

117
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,163
which is to teach players without them even realizing they're being taught.

118
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:35,047
It should be noted that even though I'm advocating not having the player realize they're in a tutorial,

119
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,010
that's still very different than not having a tutorial at all.

120
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:43,555
Okay, which brings us to number two, it's better to have the player do than read.

121
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:47,098
Instead of having the player read what they're going to do,

122
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:48,879
why not have them do what they're going to do?

123
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:53,843
The best way for the player to learn is by actually performing the actions within the game

124
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:55,203
and actually playing it.

125
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,564
Plus, playing the game is just so much more fun than reading about it.

126
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,545
Let's take Plants vs. Zombies level one here.

127
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:05,466
We needed to teach a few basic concepts to the player, like

128
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,807
zombies walk to the left in a straight line and peas shoot to the right in a straight line.

129
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:11,893
And we could have spelled it out like so,

130
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:14,474
and put these messages on the screen.

131
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:17,535
But instead, we wanted to let the player experience it

132
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,696
in a safe environment, like where the player could actually

133
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,176
feel like they're already playing the game.

134
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:24,657
So what we did was we crafted this really basic level

135
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:27,258
with just one type of plant, one type of zombie,

136
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,019
the pea shooter, one type of plant, the pea shooter,

137
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,359
one type of zombie, the basic zombie,

138
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,040
and just one single lane where you could plant stuff on.

139
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,841
Here, all the things a player can observe are,

140
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:39,122
like they can observe that zombies take damage

141
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:39,862
while they're playing.

142
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:42,463
They can observe that zombies walk in a straight line.

143
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,203
They can observe that peas shoot in a straight line

144
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:47,964
and that zombies take about 10 peas to kill.

145
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:50,745
And they can experience this all within the first level

146
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,846
without us actually putting any words on the screen.

147
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,687
And so the player learns all of this

148
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,667
by simply playing the game.

149
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,248
And we didn't have to explicitly tell them any of it.

150
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:02,709
Here's another example of where we wanted

151
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,149
to have the player learn by doing.

152
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:07,447
Hopefully you're all familiar with the shovel in PVZ.

153
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:10,088
It lets you remove one of your plants

154
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,849
so you can put a new one in its place.

155
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,051
There's a lot of history behind the shovel in PVZ

156
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:17,852
and how we decided to implement its tutorial.

157
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:19,653
And I want to go through it all with you

158
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,334
to give you an idea of how much care was placed on letting

159
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,375
the player learn by doing.

160
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,076
Here's something we didn't want to do,

161
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,677
which is just to put a message up on the screen that says,

162
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,019
did you know you could use the shovel to dig up plants

163
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,919
to replace it with others?

164
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,905
Because for something so early and integral in the game,

165
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,448
we really wanted to make sure players knew of it,

166
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:44,711
because a message like this is pretty easy to miss.

167
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,054
And we wanted to make sure they knew how to use it.

168
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:49,456
So I began looking for a solution

169
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:52,019
where the player would actually pick up the shovel and use it.

170
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,603
So this was our first attempt.

171
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,282
We knew we were giving out the shovel around level 1-5.

172
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:02,244
And we also, coincidentally, knew we were going to have,

173
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:05,006
we were going to want to have a minigame show up on level 1-5.

174
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:08,268
So why not have the minigame teach the shovel mechanic,

175
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:08,488
right?

176
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,450
It's a great way to get the player to learn by doing.

177
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,631
This minigame here.

178
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:15,832
it placed a bunch of weeds on your lawn,

179
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:19,394
and then it had you use your shovel to get rid of the weeds.

180
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:22,496
This turned out to be not quite what we were looking for

181
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:24,116
because it didn't really teach that,

182
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:25,977
it didn't really teach that the shovel

183
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,758
was for getting your plants out of the way

184
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:28,999
so they could get replaced.

185
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,300
Instead, it kind of taught the player,

186
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,802
use the shovel to get rid of harmful things.

187
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:37,304
And that's not the message we actually wanted to get across.

188
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:44,150
So, attempt number two was to have Crazy Dave come and put walnuts all over your lawn.

189
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:46,231
And that's a pretty good start for anything.

190
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:52,175
But the minigame itself had you using the shovel to make room for the pea shooters that

191
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:53,375
would come down this conveyor belt here.

192
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:59,616
While it did a good job of teaching players to use the shovel to remove stuff to make room for other plants,

193
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:03,320
the, the minigame itself wasn't very fun.

194
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,405
There just wasn't much strategy to it, and you kind of tended to use the shovel over and over, and that got old really quick.

195
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:14,950
So next we tried another minigame where Crazy Dave comes in and tells you he lost his squirrels,

196
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,412
and that you had to dig up walnuts to find them.

197
00:09:18,273 --> 00:09:19,894
And this didn't get very far either.

198
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:22,416
Like, again, the repeated digging was problematic.

199
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:27,161
and the minigame wasn't very fun despite it containing squirrels.

200
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,264
So this is where we finally ended up.

201
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:33,227
While all this other stuff was going on,

202
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,570
we developed a minigame that actually was fun,

203
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,911
which was walnut bowling.

204
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:43,573
The problem was that walnut bowling had nothing to do with the shovel.

205
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:49,314
So we kind of compromised and we just simply prefaced the minigame with a quick tutorial

206
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:55,516
that says, hey, use your shovel to dig up these three pea shooters on your lawn so that

207
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:57,076
you can prepare for bowling.

208
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:02,357
And this is what we ultimately settled on, because it made you actually use the shovel,

209
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:08,279
it communicated that you remove plants to make room for other stuff, and it had a minigame

210
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,339
that was actually enjoyable.

211
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,940
So, even though mini-game number two, the one where you remove the walnuts to put pea

212
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,401
shooters down, even though that one might have taught the shovel mechanic slightly better,

213
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,442
we decided it was more important for the player to have a good time.

214
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:27,323
So the lesson here is that fun prevails, yet I think the tutorial still worked well enough

215
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:31,604
that everyone who played the game knew of the shovel and knew how to use it.

216
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:33,684
All right.

217
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:34,885
Number three.

218
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,865
Teaching, spread out the teaching of game mechanics.

219
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:42,526
Because if you intentionally staggered the teaching of game mechanics,

220
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:45,868
it's a really powerful tool in teaching players how to play your game.

221
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,749
And once we realize we don't have to teach everything right off the bat,

222
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,590
we can be a lot more effective at teaching.

223
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:53,991
I think, in general, it's best to think,

224
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:56,512
does the player really need to know this at this point?

225
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:00,214
And if the answer is no, then you can delay the teaching of the mechanic

226
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,574
until a later point in the game.

227
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,996
So in the case of Plants vs. Zombies,

228
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,957
we were actually quite conservative.

229
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,622
I feel like a lot of other games might not do this, but we introduced peripheral mechanics

230
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:14,602
really slowly.

231
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:19,924
So the introduction of the shovel was delayed until 1-5, which is five levels into the game.

232
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,226
And we didn't introduce the concept of money until you were ten levels in.

233
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:30,708
So on level 2-1 is where you first see a zombie drop a coin.

234
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:36,804
And then for the next 15 levels, you're only allowed to purchase one thing.

235
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:42,367
And this is all because I felt like the game was engaging enough that we didn't need to

236
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:48,571
sidetrack the players with kind of a sudden store where you could buy a bunch of things.

237
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:52,714
So we only allowed you to purchase one thing, which was an upgrade that lets you choose

238
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,014
more plants at the start of the level.

239
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:58,777
And it's just enough to demonstrate that money in this game can buy you cool stuff.

240
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:03,219
And it wasn't until 3-4, that's 25 levels in,

241
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,600
where we finally opened up the store

242
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,361
and gave you a choice of what to buy.

243
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:09,523
And even at this point, the store only opened up

244
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,064
with a limited selection, like you see on the screen.

245
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:15,466
And we gradually introduced the rest of the items

246
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:16,246
as the game went on.

247
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,829
And the most extreme example is that we

248
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,465
We knew the Zen Garden was something, it was something,

249
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,546
it was a mode that you kind of would play

250
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:27,507
after you beat Adventure,

251
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,768
but yet we still wanted to give the player,

252
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,909
like make the players aware of it

253
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:30,789
and give them a taste of it.

254
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,531
So we introduced the Zen Garden with a mini tutorial

255
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:37,614
after level 5-4, and that's 45 levels into the game

256
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,915
and five levels before the game is done.

257
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:43,543
And so why would we do such a crazy thing?

258
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,145
Well, OK, so Zen Garden comes with a somewhat elaborate

259
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:49,166
tutorial that takes about three minutes to get through.

260
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:51,928
Now just imagine if we presented that near the

261
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,749
beginning of the game, like spending three minutes teaching

262
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:55,910
you an optional mode of the game.

263
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:59,392
I know if a game did that to me, that would be the

264
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:01,253
perfect time to drop out and stop playing.

265
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:04,935
So when I first start playing a game, there's only a certain

266
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:06,136
willingness to put up with things.

267
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:09,427
But as the game goes on and I become more invested over time,

268
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,389
my willingness to learn actually grows.

269
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,591
And at that point, you can start introducing new concepts.

270
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:19,114
The other advantage is by delivering messages

271
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:21,856
at a relevant time, their teaching effectiveness

272
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:22,356
is increased.

273
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:26,119
So suppose you're trying to convey what a power-up does,

274
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:27,520
that you don't get until level 10.

275
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:30,662
You know what the best time to convey that would be?

276
00:13:31,182 --> 00:13:33,224
That would be right before you get it on level 10

277
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:34,485
and not at the beginning of the game.

278
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:39,114
because we learn much better if we're presented with the relevant information

279
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:40,634
and are able to apply it immediately.

280
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:45,135
And yet another advantage to spacing out your game mechanics

281
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:48,356
is it lets the player, it gives the player a chance to apply what they've learned.

282
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,457
I once played a puzzle game that introduced all of its mechanics

283
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:53,797
within the first few levels of the game.

284
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:58,238
They introduced it one by one, one level after another,

285
00:13:58,318 --> 00:13:59,438
and one mechanic after another.

286
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,759
And before I got to toy around with the first mechanic,

287
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:05,178
they already kind of moved me on to the next one.

288
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,519
And while I'd rather have that problem than a boring game

289
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:12,140
with no new mechanics, I feel like that game could have been

290
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,161
improved if it first taught you a mechanic,

291
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,342
and then gave you a level or two to play with that mechanic

292
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,422
before teaching another one.

293
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:22,663
So the key is to paste the game to introduce just enough

294
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:26,645
that the game remains interesting while not

295
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:27,545
overwhelming the player.

296
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:31,346
So for Plants vs. Zombies, we were originally shooting

297
00:14:31,386 --> 00:14:33,167
for one new zombie every level.

298
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,620
And we found that, we found it actually was more effective to space them out a bit.

299
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,142
And so, instead we tried one zombie every, one new zombie every other level instead.

300
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,924
And the format for that is we'd, we'd introduce the zombies on levels that would be kind of

301
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:51,685
easier and that would let you kind of learn about the zombie in a safe environment.

302
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:57,187
And then, for the next level, we kind of, we kind of, once you, once you know how to

303
00:14:57,227 --> 00:15:01,569
handle the zombie, we'd present it again in combination with the other ones, the other

304
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,830
zombies in a more challenging level.

305
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,290
And here's sort of a random tip I found.

306
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,333
I found that in-game stores, they

307
00:15:12,353 --> 00:15:14,414
can be a pretty decent way of getting information

308
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:15,315
to players as well.

309
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:19,218
So say like you have a bunch of advanced concepts to teach,

310
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,521
like a bunch of power-ups that all do different things.

311
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:26,144
You can try sticking them in the store if your game has one.

312
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:29,607
Because a player kind of goes into it thinking,

313
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,309
I have all this in-game currency.

314
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,381
I spent time earning and I need to spend it in the best way possible.

315
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:39,666
So what they're going to do is they're going to do some comparison shopping and they're

316
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:43,931
going to read all the store descriptions to figure out which item is the best to spend

317
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:44,651
their money on.

318
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,835
That's only at the point where the player is kind of invested in your game.

319
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:53,561
So that's where you can kind of put some info, knowing the player is likely to read it.

320
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:58,993
It kind of boils down again to the investment versus the willingness to learn thing, but

321
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:04,580
only this time, instead of the investment being time, your investment is now the in-game

322
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:04,980
currency.

323
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:11,429
Okay, number four is to just get the player to do it once.

324
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:16,677
Sometimes all you need to do is get the player to perform an action once.

325
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:22,019
Once a player performs an action and sees the resultant behavior, it's often all it

326
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,500
takes for the player to get it and to understand.

327
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,262
So sometimes you can flash a button that you want the player to press, or you can point

328
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:32,983
an arrow at an important object, and sometimes that's all you need to do.

329
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,985
For instance, the first coin we drop in the game,

330
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,366
we put a little bouncy arrow above it

331
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,367
to kind of draw your eye to it

332
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:43,007
and make the players more likely to click on it.

333
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:46,809
Here on the first level in the game,

334
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:49,130
we flash the seed packet like so.

335
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,731
And whoa, whoa, whoa, check this out, okay.

336
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:56,052
And it draws your eye to the seed packet.

337
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,233
And once you click it,

338
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,254
you'll notice the plant goes into your cursor

339
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:02,675
and then the grass starts flashing like this.

340
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:06,028
And it makes you really want to click on the grass,

341
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:06,369
doesn't it?

342
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,592
So now in clicking the grass, I've successfully

343
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:13,034
selected a seed packet, put the plant down,

344
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:16,117
and learned one of the fundamental actions of the game.

345
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:19,560
And all I had to do was click on whatever was flashing.

346
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:23,223
And now I want to run you through one

347
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:27,206
of the biggest design challenges we faced when making PVZ.

348
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,588
So sunflowers, as you know, they're

349
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,570
the economy in Plants vs. Zombies.

350
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,131
They're kind of like the backbone of the game.

351
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:37,019
But the idea of an economy in a video game is not someone,

352
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,040
it's not something that everyone understands.

353
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:42,442
So about halfway through the development of PVC,

354
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:44,864
we got a couple pieces of really important feedback.

355
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:49,587
These come from a PopCap employee basically pointing out

356
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,709
that his wife, not coming from a hardcore gaming background,

357
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:56,932
just totally didn't understand the importance of planting lots of sunflowers early.

358
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:02,269
Instead of starting out planting a bunch of sunflowers like this,

359
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:03,769
which I do,

360
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,110
she would neglect planting sunflowers

361
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,611
and her lawn would look something more like this.

362
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:11,471
And this is fine for the early levels in the game,

363
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,692
but you're not going to beat the game playing this way.

364
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,453
And here are a couple of more pieces of feedback

365
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:22,794
that echo the previous ones.

366
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,154
These players had never heard the term RTS,

367
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:27,035
nor did they understand that

368
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:28,795
it was important to build up your economy.

369
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:35,330
And at this point, I realized this was the biggest flaw with our game.

370
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,772
I'd set out to make a strategy game that anyone could pick up and play, and now I was confronted

371
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:49,893
with the daunting task of teaching the importance of economy to non-gamers, and I didn't quite

372
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:52,274
know how to do it, and I wasn't sure if we could pull it off.

373
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:58,235
So I asked a bunch of people at PopCap for suggestions on how to fix this, and they came

374
00:18:58,275 --> 00:18:59,475
up with a bunch of good ideas to try.

375
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:06,608
The first was to consider making it, making the resources work more like in the traditional

376
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:07,208
tower defense.

377
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:13,871
Because the guy, the earlier guy's wife, he actually, you know, she played a few of these

378
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:18,093
and had no trouble understanding the traditional tower defense types.

379
00:19:19,154 --> 00:19:23,456
Because in these traditional tower defense games, you automatically earn resources every

380
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:24,436
time a monster is killed.

381
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:29,038
So as long as you're doing a good job defending, you'll have enough resources for more towers.

382
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:30,679
It's not a separate economy.

383
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:38,767
But this would involve, one, removing sunflowers and their separate economy from the game,

384
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:47,553
which I didn't want to do because I felt like that economy was something that differentiated

385
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,214
our game from other tower defense games.

386
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:55,559
And two, I just felt the sunflower was too iconic a character to cut, and I didn't want

387
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:56,059
to toss it out.

388
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:02,444
So the next suggestion was to add in some tutorial messages here and there.

389
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,001
like trying to explain sunflowers on a more relatable level

390
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,841
instead of like this kind of engineering text.

391
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,882
So, for instance, saying stuff like,

392
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:14,223
sun is like fuel, you need it to plant other plants.

393
00:20:15,444 --> 00:20:18,345
Stuff that kind of the general public could get

394
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,605
or could relate to.

395
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,446
And I thought that was fine,

396
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:23,546
and we did end up doing a little bit of this.

397
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:27,968
But I wanted to cover all fronts regarding the sunflower.

398
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:34,332
Suggestion number three was to start out with a column of sunflowers.

399
00:20:35,073 --> 00:20:39,077
And I like that it gave you an indication.

400
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:45,104
So you would start the level with a column or two of sunflowers and players could kind

401
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,325
of go off of that.

402
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:50,389
And I liked it because it gave you an indication of how many sunflowers you might need and

403
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:51,631
it kind of reminded you to...

404
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:54,970
It reminded you that sunflowers are a good thing.

405
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,912
But I wasn't convinced that if we suddenly stopped giving them

406
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:00,393
out at some point, which we would have to do,

407
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:03,935
that novice players would adapt and know

408
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:04,755
what to do at that point.

409
00:21:06,116 --> 00:21:08,157
So the fourth idea was to actually have

410
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:11,118
some spaces on the lawn reserve for just planting sunflowers

411
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,140
and you can't plant anything else there.

412
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,481
And that's also a pretty good idea.

413
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:18,843
And it would kind of actually change

414
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:19,743
the game a decent amount.

415
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:20,384
But.

416
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,921
I wanted to see if, I felt like it added a bit of complexity and I wanted to see if the

417
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,722
problem was solvable without doing that.

418
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:31,143
So what did we end up doing?

419
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:36,305
I think the solution we came up with, I think it turned out to be quite effective.

420
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:40,286
So first you have to notice that at the time...

421
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,712
Both sunflowers and peashooters costed 100 sun.

422
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,273
So they both costed the same amount.

423
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,455
And the other thing that was different at the time was we

424
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,997
started you out with 200 sun, which meant at the beginning

425
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:55,339
of the level, at the very beginning, you could plant two

426
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,881
of any combination of a peashooter or a sunflower.

427
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:02,844
And the reason for these numbers isn't, I just chose

428
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:04,485
them because they seem like nice, round numbers.

429
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,067
And they felt good in play testing.

430
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,509
So a hardcore gamer kind of knows what to do here.

431
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,464
they plant a lot of sunflowers early on to build up your economy.

432
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:17,746
But imagine you're someone with not much gaming experience,

433
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,227
and you see both the pea shooter and the sunflower lit up.

434
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:22,968
Which one are you going to plant?

435
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:26,530
You're going to plant the pea shooter

436
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,292
because it seems more effective at fending off zombies.

437
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:34,454
The sunflower might seem kind of frivolous at this point,

438
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:37,195
and so in planting just pea shooters,

439
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:38,976
you're going to end up with a layout like this,

440
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:40,717
a layout with no sunflowers.

441
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,267
So what did we do?

442
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:45,669
It was pretty simple.

443
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:47,791
We changed the sunflower to cost 50.

444
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:52,014
And we also changed the starting amount of sun to 50,

445
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,216
so that now when you start a level, it looks like this.

446
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:58,298
So if you'll notice, the pea shooter is grayed out.

447
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,760
And there's only one option when you start the level,

448
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,601
and it's sunflower.

449
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:06,024
So no matter who you are, the first thing you're going to do

450
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:08,866
is likely to plant a sunflower and not a pea shooter.

451
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:15,723
Another nice effect of costing the sunflower at 50 is that the sunflower would tend to

452
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:20,167
light up more often because when you have enough money to buy something, it lights up.

453
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:24,392
And so when you're at 50 sun, the sunflower would be lit and not a lot of other things

454
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:24,632
would.

455
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:25,273
And when you're at 75 sun...

456
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,888
the sunflower would be still lit.

457
00:23:29,348 --> 00:23:31,769
And so it would just light up more naturally

458
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:32,650
over the course of the game.

459
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,052
And so due to it costing less, players

460
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,933
would just naturally tend to plant more sunflowers, which

461
00:23:38,973 --> 00:23:39,914
is what we wanted them to do.

462
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,556
And for this technique, I kind of

463
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,796
have to thank Fisher Price.

464
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:48,498
I looked at how a preschooler's brain works,

465
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:51,060
which is just to press the bright, shiny object.

466
00:23:53,776 --> 00:23:56,839
And it worked out in this game, so I guess we never truly outgrow that instinct.

467
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,421
So this one change let us satisfy both camps.

468
00:24:00,601 --> 00:24:05,365
We were essentially forcing the first thing you planted to be a sunflower, but hopefully

469
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:09,147
the novice player appreciated the guidance, and hopefully the hardcore player didn't feel

470
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:13,190
like they were just playing on easy mode with everything pointed out to them, because we

471
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,351
made it a rule of the game.

472
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:18,114
Like the game's flow naturally favored you doing the right thing.

473
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:21,388
OK, but we weren't done yet.

474
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:25,953
In this screenshot, you can see that both the sunflower

475
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:28,235
and the walnut are lit up, and since they both cost $50.

476
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:31,318
And this is still pretty early in the game,

477
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:32,940
and it was a situation I wanted to avoid,

478
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,522
because we went through all that trouble to make it

479
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:37,124
so the sunflower was the only thing lit up.

480
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:43,264
So I was concerned that novice players might still pick the walnut here over the sunflower,

481
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,384
which would be a bad move.

482
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:49,465
So we tried changing the walnut to cost 75 so that it wouldn't be lit up at the beginning

483
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:52,686
of the level, but it just didn't feel right at that price.

484
00:24:54,547 --> 00:24:59,007
What we ended up doing was to have the walnut start the level charging up so that the beginning

485
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:00,108
of the level would look more like this.

486
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:06,729
So in Plants vs. Zombies now, you'll notice that there's a few plants that start the level

487
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,890
on recharge, so they're actually dimmed out.

488
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:12,231
And we would run into the same issue with the potato mine

489
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,151
because it costed 25.

490
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:15,373
You can see that here.

491
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:19,276
And so we applied this initial recharge

492
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:22,838
to all plants that had a longer recharge.

493
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,059
And that did the trick.

494
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:26,481
And hopefully this didn't stick out

495
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,561
to anyone who played the game.

496
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:29,603
But if you notice it, that's the reason we did it.

497
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,745
So now for the first 10 levels of the game,

498
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,367
the sunflower is the only thing highlighted

499
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:36,227
at the start of the level.

500
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:38,689
And the solution worked, but.

501
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:46,561
Unfortunately, changing something as fundamental as the sunflowers cost meant we had to rebalance

502
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:47,622
and retest the entire game.

503
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:49,142
I don't know how many hours I spent.

504
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:56,646
I played through the entire game maybe like three times, and also we slowed down to make

505
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:59,487
the rate of sun more equivalent to what it was before.

506
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:04,389
We slowed down the rate at which the sun popped out of the sunflowers to kind of balance their

507
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,309
newly reduced cost.

508
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,751
Because it would be kind of like...

509
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,402
like charging 25 minerals instead of 50 for an SCV in StarCraft.

510
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:19,803
If one numerical change like that could cause a ripple effect

511
00:26:19,843 --> 00:26:22,444
that would result in dozens of hours of work.

512
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:28,386
And then they'd also have to reprice a bunch of things and rebounce the entire game.

513
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:32,227
So this is just to emphasize the measures we went to

514
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:35,328
in order to make the teaching of our game more straightforward.

515
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:41,159
OK, number five is use fewer words.

516
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,821
I sort of have this rule with my games

517
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,543
that there should be a maximum of eight words on the screen

518
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:47,344
at any given moment.

519
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:51,587
Of course, this is pretty much impossible to maintain,

520
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,669
and I do break the rule from time to time.

521
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,832
But I feel like it's a good thing to shoot for.

522
00:26:56,852 --> 00:27:00,795
And it's also important to keep your tutorial messages low

523
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:01,796
on the number of sentences.

524
00:27:03,261 --> 00:27:06,824
So you have to figure out what needs to be said to the player and say only that.

525
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:12,609
So let's go through an example of a one-sentence message with a four-sentence message.

526
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:15,312
So here's what we did in the game.

527
00:27:15,352 --> 00:27:19,716
We have a nice, concise statement that says, click on a seed packet to pick it up.

528
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:22,919
And in contrast, here's what we could have done.

529
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,781
We could have had a bloated four-sentence tutorial message here.

530
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:30,577
In this first case, the player is likely to read that one sentence,

531
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:34,060
process it, and use that knowledge to play the game.

532
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:36,423
And in the second case,

533
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:39,005
how many sentences do you think the player is going to read?

534
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:41,468
Probably not all four.

535
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:44,230
I think, in fact, I think it's more likely they're going to read zero.

536
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:49,362
Because it's just something about our brains that when we see a big block of text like this,

537
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:50,923
we tend to tune out.

538
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:54,003
And personally, I get that too.

539
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:56,884
Like, when I see big blocks of text presented like this early in a game,

540
00:27:57,604 --> 00:27:59,724
I tend to forward-pass them.

541
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:02,205
Because we think it's either too much work to read,

542
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:05,205
or we expect that there's nothing important in there.

543
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,566
So, in Plants vs. Zombies,

544
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:11,226
we made our plant descriptions as short as possible.

545
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:17,614
I tried to think of the one sentence that I would want the player to know and just say

546
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:17,854
that.

547
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:21,978
So, for the sunflower, we just said, gives you an additional sun.

548
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:23,899
And that's nice and short.

549
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,423
For the cherry bomb, it says, blows up all zombies in an area.

550
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:29,764
That's nice.

551
00:28:31,206 --> 00:28:35,189
And here's an example where I tried to distill a description down to just the most important

552
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:35,550
sentence.

553
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:41,676
If you know this fume shroom, you'll know that it does AOE damage to all zombies in

554
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:42,056
a line.

555
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:45,557
But notice, I didn't say that in the description.

556
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:50,499
All I said was, it shoots fumes that can pass through screen doors.

557
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,701
Because that's going to be the most important thing to know when you're facing down a horde

558
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:56,902
of screen door zombies like this.

559
00:28:57,922 --> 00:29:02,464
So knowing about the AOE damage is actually secondary to knowing that you can effectively

560
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:03,805
take out a screen door zombie with it.

561
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,251
So when coming up with messages to say in your tutorials,

562
00:29:09,112 --> 00:29:11,013
it might be useful to think of it in a manner of speaking,

563
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:14,215
which I've dubbed the sophisticated caveman.

564
00:29:16,036 --> 00:29:18,478
So you speak to the player in a way that this guy would.

565
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,940
He's not an unsophisticated caveman.

566
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,521
He doesn't replace his eyes with me's,

567
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:25,523
but he tends to get his ideas across

568
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,604
in the fewest word possible.

569
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:28,365
So let's go through some examples.

570
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,746
Shoots peas at the enemy.

571
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:32,868
See, you can almost imagine him saying that.

572
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,861
blows up all zombies in an area. You got the shovel.

573
00:29:38,782 --> 00:29:41,403
And perhaps this was easy for me to implement

574
00:29:41,443 --> 00:29:44,666
in PvZ because it's actually not too far from

575
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:45,806
my natural way of speaking.

576
00:29:48,188 --> 00:29:50,049
I believe, I believe last year at GDC I

577
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:53,631
had a juicy quote. It was really bad and

578
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:57,194
that made me really sad. I actually said this

579
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:59,915
at a talk last year. And as you can

580
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:00,716
see, it totally fits.

581
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:05,373
So whenever we had larger amounts of dialogue,

582
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:07,755
I found it effective to break it into small chunks

583
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:09,577
for the player to digest one at a time.

584
00:30:10,638 --> 00:30:12,760
Crazy Dave says a decent amount of stuff in PVZ.

585
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:16,362
And we found that it was easier to read when it was broken up

586
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,604
into little pieces that you forwarded through one

587
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,525
at a time with each click.

588
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:23,128
Old Nintendo games did this nicely.

589
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:26,231
Maybe they did it intentionally, but maybe they just

590
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:28,412
had a limited number of pixels to display on the screen.

591
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:31,895
And one more thing to note about Crazy Dave.

592
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:38,306
Our initial, our initial thought was we came up with this character so that he'd deliver

593
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:40,327
the tutorial in the beginning of the game.

594
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:42,768
And a lot of games do this.

595
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:46,110
They have an in-game character that delivers the tutorial to you.

596
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,873
The idea is it's more personable and it introduces the character at the same time, which is hopefully

597
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,414
entertaining to the player.

598
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:59,056
So we were originally going to have him pop up in level 1-1 here and teach you the basics

599
00:30:59,096 --> 00:30:59,436
of the game.

600
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,392
The problem was he first had to introduce himself before he even started telling you

601
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:04,772
what to do.

602
00:31:06,313 --> 00:31:11,336
And also the lines he said, they all had to be infused with his crazy character.

603
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:15,698
And so that actually made the tutorial less direct than I wanted it to be.

604
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:22,301
So ultimately we chose to delay his introduction until five levels into the game and keep the

605
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:24,703
early tutorials really direct and concise like this.

606
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,191
It kind of goes back to this graph.

607
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:30,634
Like, when players start out playing your game, you really,

608
00:31:30,774 --> 00:31:32,856
you kind of, you want to put your best foot forward.

609
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,640
And if, if that best foot is your gameplay, then you kind

610
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,521
of want to get out of the way.

611
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:39,303
And you don't want your player to be

612
00:31:39,343 --> 00:31:40,484
reading a bunch of dialogue.

613
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:43,267
You want them to be playing your game as soon as possible.

614
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,190
And then, and then once you have them invested in your

615
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,592
game and after playing a few levels, you, you can start

616
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:50,074
peppering in more and more dialogue.

617
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:56,250
OK, number six is to use unobtrusive messaging,

618
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:56,870
if possible.

619
00:31:58,771 --> 00:31:59,392
Don't break flow.

620
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,494
Whenever I display a message in the middle of a game,

621
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:05,135
I try to display it in a passive manner

622
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:07,517
so that the player doesn't have to instantly stop

623
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:09,298
what they're doing and read the message.

624
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:12,440
Because I've had too many cases where

625
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,362
I'm getting into the groove of a game, and a dialogue pops up,

626
00:32:15,622 --> 00:32:18,123
and it freezes the action, and it requires me to press OK.

627
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:20,144
Kind of like this.

628
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,970
So I try not to use OK dialogues that pop up without warning,

629
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:29,312
unless there's something I absolutely

630
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:30,213
need the player to know.

631
00:32:30,713 --> 00:32:33,175
I prefer to present messages that are passively displayed,

632
00:32:33,235 --> 00:32:34,696
like at the bottom of the screen here,

633
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:36,837
and that let you continue playing while you read them.

634
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:39,479
This is a good example.

635
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,481
It's a side scroller where the words, press z to jump,

636
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:43,682
are written on the background wall.

637
00:32:43,782 --> 00:32:46,685
So it actually scrolls along the wall as you move.

638
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:49,547
And the info is presented to you at a relevant time,

639
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:52,869
right before you need to jump, right here.

640
00:32:53,614 --> 00:32:57,457
and you can read it at your leisure so it doesn't break your flow.

641
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:01,599
And also, when you don't need to know the info anymore,

642
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,361
it just naturally scrolls off the screen as you progress.

643
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:08,023
OK, number seven is to use adaptive messaging.

644
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:12,105
So can any of you remember this message displaying

645
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:14,347
during your playthrough of Plants vs. Zombies?

646
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:15,347
It reads,

647
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:17,229
one of your pea shooters has died.

648
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:18,930
Try planting them further to the left.

649
00:33:20,003 --> 00:33:23,405
If you don't, it's probably because you were doing the right thing and didn't need to be

650
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:24,046
shown this message.

651
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:28,069
This message is only shown to players who lose a pea shooter in one of the early levels

652
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:31,872
and only if that pea shooter was planted in one of the rightmost columns.

653
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:39,438
So by watching someone play your game, you can kind of get an idea of the messages you

654
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,278
might need to display.

655
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:45,222
The plant your pea shooter to the left message, that originated when we had a friend come

656
00:33:45,242 --> 00:33:46,023
in for a play test.

657
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,705
And I was kind of baffled as he...

658
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:52,394
kind of placed all his peashooters in the far right column

659
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:56,235
and then the zombies would eat them and then he'd proceed to lose.

660
00:33:57,075 --> 00:34:00,036
So we put this contextual message into the game

661
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:04,357
because we didn't want other people to do what he did.

662
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,998
And yet if we displayed this message to a hardcore gamer

663
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:12,419
who already knew what to do, it might feel kind of insulting.

664
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,640
Like if we straight up tell those players what to do,

665
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,280
we don't give them the chance to feel smart and we don't.

666
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:20,995
when they already know how to do the right thing.

667
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,997
Plus a guy like this might feel insulted

668
00:34:26,037 --> 00:34:28,078
if we told him too much of what he already knew.

669
00:34:28,578 --> 00:34:30,519
To him it would feel like hand-holdy

670
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,720
or if we flashed the plant your pea shooters

671
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,201
to the left message right in front of his face.

672
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:36,582
And meanwhile someone like my mom

673
00:34:36,682 --> 00:34:38,302
could really appreciate a message by,

674
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,643
like a message saying try planting your pea shooters

675
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,364
further to the left.

676
00:34:41,764 --> 00:34:43,524
So by using adaptive messaging

677
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:45,545
we can make sure people like my mom are covered

678
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:48,747
while at the same time not offending Mr. Power Glove here.

679
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:54,618
You can use adaptive messaging to deliver appropriate info

680
00:34:54,638 --> 00:34:55,799
to players of all levels.

681
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,240
And here's another check we do.

682
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:02,023
From levels 1-3 to 1-8, if a player still

683
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:04,264
has less than three sunflowers about a minute into the level,

684
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:05,665
we display this message.

685
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,888
We say, try to plant at least three sunflowers.

686
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:10,909
Followed by this.

687
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:13,591
Planting sunflowers will improve your chances

688
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,032
of surviving the zombie attack.

689
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:17,754
The point is, players won't see this message

690
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:19,315
if they're already doing the right thing.

691
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,271
And just like everything else, there's always the possibility of going overboard.

692
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:26,912
There's no need to explain every single concept in a game.

693
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,813
We only need to do enough to get players to understand the basics.

694
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:35,475
I find that most things from minute 30 and beyond, they're actually better learned by

695
00:35:35,515 --> 00:35:37,636
experimentation instead of hand-holding.

696
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:41,758
Because figuring out certain strategies in games is the best part.

697
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:43,118
You don't want to rob the player of that.

698
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,659
So let's look at this example from Insane Aquarium.

699
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,720
It's the game I made before Plants vs. Zombies.

700
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:52,510
It's sort of an RTS disguised as a fish feeding simulation.

701
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,592
You click on the screen and you drop pellets of fish food for your guppies.

702
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:59,694
And at some point in the game, you get access to a larger fish called a carnivore.

703
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:03,977
It's that one on the right, the black and red one.

704
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:06,038
And they don't eat regular fish food.

705
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,039
And you kind of have to figure out what to feed them.

706
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:12,549
There were a few playtesters who, who never figured out what to feed the carnivores.

707
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,369
And someone at PopCap suggested that we, we put a little hint saying,

708
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,990
feed small guppies to the carnivores, like at the start of the game.

709
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,690
And I didn't want to, I didn't want to be so in-your-face obvious.

710
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,531
And I, I certainly didn't want to rob the player of that sense of discovery

711
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,712
that you get when you, when you do figure out how to feed them.

712
00:36:29,632 --> 00:36:32,932
So instead, we did this.

713
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,713
We did this sort of adaptive messaging.

714
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:38,148
After your first carnivore dies of starvation, we say,

715
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:39,909
warning, your carnivore has died,

716
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,910
just to kind of draw a little attention

717
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,871
that you're feeding them the wrong thing.

718
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:47,212
And at that point, if the player figures it out,

719
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:48,513
it's all good.

720
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:52,134
But after your next carnivore dies, we display this,

721
00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:54,075
and it hopefully guides the player

722
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:55,416
in a little bit more of the right direction.

723
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,717
It says, hint, carnivores won't eat fish food.

724
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:01,198
And finally, after the third carnivore dies,

725
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,119
we just flat-out tell them.

726
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:03,779
We tell them to try feeding small guppies

727
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:04,480
to your carnivores.

728
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:08,026
And for the players that figured this out before we gave them all three hints, they

729
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:09,026
probably felt pretty good about it.

730
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:13,207
OK, number eight is don't create noise.

731
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:18,128
One more reason you want to be frugal with what message you're displaying on screen is

732
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,929
so that you don't create noise.

733
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:24,490
Because as game makers, we're kind of competing with players for their attention versus all

734
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,051
the other stuff they could be doing, like surfing the internet or something.

735
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:28,871
So what I don't get is when...

736
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:32,094
a player competes with itself for the player's attention.

737
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:36,515
Because we can only rely on the player being focused on one thing at any given time,

738
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:39,856
if that, and so it's important to be aware of

739
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:43,917
what you want your player to be focused on, especially in the early game.

740
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:46,578
You want to make it easy for your player to learn,

741
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,519
and you don't want to be showing them a bunch of irrelevant text,

742
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:53,561
like through cluttered UI or pop-ups or early achievements.

743
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:58,302
So this fake screenshot is why we were reluctant to add achievements to Plants vs. Zombies.

744
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,563
Especially ones that can trigger early in the game.

745
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:04,925
Because we want the player here to be focused on the text at the bottom of the screen,

746
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:09,587
but let's just say they inadvertently unlock an achievement at the same time.

747
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:11,348
So now where are they supposed to focus?

748
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:13,449
They're like looking up and down and like they're confused.

749
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,870
If they read the achievement text,

750
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,431
then they'll be missing out on the message we actually want them to be reading.

751
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:23,184
So the original PC version of PVZ was achievement-free,

752
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:25,926
but every other platform it was released on

753
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:26,807
eventually added them.

754
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:28,688
And I'm not saying achievements can't be designed

755
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:30,869
effectively, but we wanted to avoid a

756
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,010
situation like the above.

757
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,412
And so we opted not to include achievements at first.

758
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:42,487
And another reason to eliminate noise is every time we display a message that that player finds relevant,

759
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:43,949
we're building that player's trust.

760
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:50,420
And likewise, every time we display a message that's irrelevant, we do the opposite.

761
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,643
So if we're forcing the player to read things,

762
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:56,385
we want to make sure it's either enlightening or entertaining.

763
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:00,628
If we, if we bombard the player with one irrelevant message after another,

764
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:03,010
then it becomes kind of like the boy who cried wolf,

765
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,472
and then the player will just hit a breaking point and they'll tune out.

766
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:07,913
So we've, we've essentially lost their trust,

767
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:10,335
and now the player is less likely to pay attention

768
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:11,896
when we do have a message worth reading.

769
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:14,278
So basically, don't cry wolf.

770
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:16,840
And

771
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:18,395
No.

772
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:20,476
And this, I just wanted to demonstrate

773
00:39:20,516 --> 00:39:22,657
how one carefully placed comma can change everything.

774
00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:24,197
OK.

775
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,439
Number nine is to use visuals to teach.

776
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,221
So these last few sections, they kind of

777
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:34,202
fall a little bit out of the realm of the tutorial itself

778
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:37,404
and more into the realm of make your game intuitive

779
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:38,504
and it will be easier to learn.

780
00:39:39,965 --> 00:39:41,826
For Plants vs. Zombies, we really

781
00:39:41,886 --> 00:39:44,227
emphasize the power that visuals can have in order

782
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:44,907
to teach the player.

783
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:49,569
So when creating the individual plants and zombies,

784
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,750
I tried to adhere to a couple of rules.

785
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,091
My rule number one was that you should

786
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:55,772
be able to look at a plant or zombie

787
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:57,533
and know what it does instantly.

788
00:39:58,173 --> 00:39:59,854
And the benefit of this should be obvious.

789
00:39:59,894 --> 00:40:02,635
If we can communicate through visuals only what a plant

790
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:06,297
or zombie does, the less we have to teach with words.

791
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,960
So let's go through a few examples of the touches

792
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,241
we added, starting with this pea shooter here.

793
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:19,302
In this guy's case, I just, I simply wanted to make sure to give him a spout, so that

794
00:40:19,382 --> 00:40:21,644
it would look like he shot stuff out of his mouth.

795
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:27,228
For the screen door zombie, it kind of looks like he's holding a shield in front of him,

796
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,189
which makes you think that he's tougher to kill.

797
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,173
And in the case of the spike weed, we put him low to the ground and added these nasty

798
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:38,856
looking spikes coming out of him, so that it would look like it would be bad for zombies

799
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:39,677
to step on this guy.

800
00:40:41,178 --> 00:40:42,199
And in the three peters case...

801
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,454
He's got three heads, each of which resembles a pea shooter's head, and if you know what

802
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:51,738
a pea shooter does, then you can kind of extrapolate what the three-peater might do, which is to

803
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:53,380
shoot three things at a time.

804
00:40:54,821 --> 00:41:00,326
My rule number two is, if I can't achieve rule number one, then at least you should

805
00:41:00,346 --> 00:41:05,691
know what a plant or zombie does after seeing it do its thing, after seeing it do it once

806
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:06,532
for the first time.

807
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:08,393
So, looking at the jalapeno here...

808
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,862
At first you might not know exactly what it does, you might just think it has something

809
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:20,285
to do with being hot, but once you see it explode in a lane of fire like this, you quickly

810
00:41:20,305 --> 00:41:24,247
understand what its purpose is, which is to eliminate all zombies in a horizontal line.

811
00:41:25,228 --> 00:41:26,869
And same with the pole vaulter zombie.

812
00:41:27,669 --> 00:41:31,171
You might not understand what he does when he runs on screen, but you quickly get it

813
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,272
once you see him vault over one of your plants.

814
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:37,677
So at one point I was trying to decide how best,

815
00:41:38,137 --> 00:41:40,559
how to best visually represent a plant

816
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,840
that did twice the amount of damage as a pea shooter.

817
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,202
And this was gonna be a plant that would show up

818
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:46,783
relatively early in the game.

819
00:41:47,363 --> 00:41:49,905
So I wanted to make sure to put some extra thought into it.

820
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:52,827
So what should the repeater shoot?

821
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:55,449
A lot of you already know the answer,

822
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:56,850
but let's just go through this exercise.

823
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,284
If the repeater shot feathers, that would be pretty unacceptable.

824
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:08,428
Feathers are soft, and choosing a projectile type that seems softer than even a pea would

825
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:10,550
not really be a good way of conveying double damage.

826
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:14,993
So what about something esoteric like neutronius?

827
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:19,176
I don't know about you, but I don't know how much damage a neutronius particle does.

828
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:22,738
Is it more damaging than a pea, or is it less damaging than a pea?

829
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:28,984
This is the danger of relying on ideas that aren't based on something that the general

830
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:29,924
public understands.

831
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:32,525
Okay, so now we're talking.

832
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:33,466
We could shoot swords.

833
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:38,868
Swords definitely look like they would do more damage than peas, but how much more?

834
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,530
I would think like five times more.

835
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,332
And I could have gone with something like this, but I wanted to see if we could find

836
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:48,993
something that could communicate exactly twice the damage.

837
00:42:49,948 --> 00:42:54,592
But that said, a plant that shoots swords is pretty nifty, and if we're going for zaniness,

838
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:57,995
we might choose something like this, as long as we could theme the plant properly.

839
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:03,359
But for this plant, I wanted to make sure, because we were giving out early in the game,

840
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,022
that it accurately communicated what it did as much as possible.

841
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:10,524
This is kind of another direction, but also not bad.

842
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:14,106
I do find myself utilizing the idea that bigger is better

843
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:16,387
quite a bit when trying to visually communicate something.

844
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:18,768
So, because a large pea just looks like

845
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,329
it would do more damage than a small one.

846
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,070
Okay, so now we're getting close.

847
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,591
You have a plant here that shoots peas

848
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,192
twice as fast as a pea shooter.

849
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:30,694
So every time a pea shooter shoots one, it's shooting two.

850
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:32,295
And if you put the two side by side,

851
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:34,836
you could tell that, you could easily tell

852
00:43:34,876 --> 00:43:36,056
that one was shooting more peas

853
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:37,957
and thus doing more damage than the other.

854
00:43:38,845 --> 00:43:41,746
And if you kind of watch over the course of maybe like 10 seconds,

855
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,488
you can even notice that one is shooting exactly twice as fast as the other one.

856
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:47,548
But that would actually take some observation.

857
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:53,351
So this is quite satisfactory, but we can do one better than that.

858
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:58,493
We can take the constant stream of peas that are going twice as fast

859
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,615
and instead arrange them into volleys of two with longer intervals in between.

860
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:04,836
So this is what we went with for the repeater.

861
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:06,696
It fires volleys of two peas at a time.

862
00:44:07,508 --> 00:44:10,389
and it fires those two at the same rate

863
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:11,829
a peashooter would fire one.

864
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,870
In this case, you don't even have to observe for very long

865
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,231
before you realize it's doing twice the damage as a peashooter

866
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,452
because they're firing at the same intervals,

867
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:23,413
yet the repeater is firing two in rapid succession

868
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:24,993
every time the peashooter fire was one.

869
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:30,475
For puff shrooms, we kind of had the opposite problem

870
00:44:30,515 --> 00:44:31,255
as the repeaters.

871
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:35,296
as we needed a plant that did less damage than a pea shooter.

872
00:44:35,696 --> 00:44:38,897
And instead of having them do an arbitrarily less amount of damage,

873
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:43,699
I simply opted to limit the puffshroom's range to what you see here.

874
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,029
Most plants range in the game, they shoot across the entire screen.

875
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,651
So upon seeing the puffshroom shots just stop at the end of their range,

876
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:54,333
it's something visual you can latch on to,

877
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:57,835
and then you can realize that it's a less effective plant than the pea shooter.

878
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,257
But you'll still use these guys because they don't cost you any sun,

879
00:45:01,557 --> 00:45:02,778
and you can plant them all over the place.

880
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:06,940
One of the game's mechanics involves these gravestones,

881
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,562
which zombies rise up out of at the end of the level.

882
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:11,963
And we needed a plant to remove these gravestones for you.

883
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:16,485
And looking at all these plants, which one seems the most like it might have something

884
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,526
to do with the gravestones?

885
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:21,110
If you thought this one, it's what we thought too.

886
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:28,278
And thus, the Grave Buster was born because we visually connected a little bit the look

887
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:30,260
of the gravestones with the look of the plant.

888
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,145
And the Grave Buster kind of chews on gravestones to get them out of your way.

889
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:42,238
In terms of using visuals to communicate, I find that Nintendo's games do this really

890
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:42,478
well.

891
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:44,999
So let's study an example from Paper Mario.

892
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:49,000
In Paper Mario, Mario has two attacks in the game.

893
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,381
Jump and hammer.

894
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:53,722
Here's one of the bad guys from Paper Mario.

895
00:45:53,842 --> 00:45:54,442
It's a Goomba.

896
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,503
You jump on him and then you defeat him.

897
00:45:56,763 --> 00:45:58,304
Or you can use the hammer on him too.

898
00:45:58,324 --> 00:45:59,044
It doesn't matter.

899
00:45:59,064 --> 00:45:59,564
You can do both.

900
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,086
But then you encounter this guy, who obviously wouldn't be good to jump on.

901
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,387
So you have to use the hammer to get rid of him.

902
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:09,412
And meanwhile, the game has flying enemies

903
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:10,673
that your hammer can't reach,

904
00:46:10,793 --> 00:46:12,534
so it's best to jump on these guys.

905
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:14,695
And the game is filled with enemies

906
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,675
where the very instant you look at them,

907
00:46:16,755 --> 00:46:17,856
you know they can't be jumped on.

908
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,517
And likewise, you know you can't use a hammer

909
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:22,418
on any of these enemies,

910
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,659
because any bad guy that has wings or is up in the air,

911
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:26,680
they're hammer-proof.

912
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:30,667
And what's up with this dude?

913
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,449
He's got both a spike and wings, and how do you even

914
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:33,990
beat this thing?

915
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,952
So anyway, the lesson here, it might be to just base your

916
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:42,115
game on an absurd enough world so that it's OK to take any

917
00:46:42,195 --> 00:46:44,696
enemy and stick wings or spikes on it.

918
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:49,960
OK, number 10 is to leverage what people already know.

919
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,121
If you leverage what people have learned from their

920
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:54,543
everyday lives, you can make your games easier to learn.

921
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,649
So even when coming up with the theme for Plants vs. Zombies,

922
00:46:58,689 --> 00:47:00,290
we utilize people's general knowledge.

923
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:03,272
The game wasn't just a mishmash of two different things

924
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:05,173
fighting each other, although it might seem that way.

925
00:47:05,894 --> 00:47:08,295
I deliberately chose both plants and zombies

926
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:09,296
for specific reasons.

927
00:47:10,357 --> 00:47:11,537
The reason you have plants is,

928
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,920
PvZ is based off of the tower defense genre,

929
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,741
and I was looking for a way

930
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:19,623
to get these stationary towers in my game,

931
00:47:19,763 --> 00:47:21,624
but also inject them with some personality.

932
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:27,741
Plants were perfect because people expect plants to stay in one place and thus they

933
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,202
made good replacements for the towers.

934
00:47:30,243 --> 00:47:35,166
I could have made them something like jungle animals instead, for instance, but people

935
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:38,388
might think, hey, why doesn't that lion run up to the zombies and slash them?

936
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:41,870
Or why doesn't the gazelle run away from the zombies when it's about to get eaten?

937
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,894
One of the reasons I chose zombies is because people know zombies move slowly.

938
00:47:48,029 --> 00:47:50,971
And in creating PVZ, one of my goals was to keep the gameplay

939
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:53,372
on a single screen so that we wouldn't have to introduce

940
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:54,333
scrolling controls.

941
00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:59,756
So zombies fit perfectly as something you would expect to

942
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:02,698
move slowly, and thus it would give the player enough time to

943
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:03,298
strategize.

944
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:09,342
Another thing people know is that zombies are bad, and you

945
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:10,662
don't want to let them get to your house.

946
00:48:11,443 --> 00:48:14,645
We frame each level by first showing you your house on the

947
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:14,885
left.

948
00:48:15,673 --> 00:48:17,534
and then panning over to the zombies on the right.

949
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:20,636
And the action takes place kind of in between,

950
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:23,597
but it's clear that at this point that you don't want the zombies

951
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:25,738
to get from the right side of your screen to the left side of the screen.

952
00:48:27,499 --> 00:48:30,461
For Insanity Aquarium, I leveraged the fact that I didn't need to teach people

953
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,922
that fish need fish food,

954
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:36,004
so I was free to spend my energy teaching the other stuff in the game.

955
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:40,627
Okay, in Plants vs. Zombies, we have a class of

956
00:48:41,267 --> 00:48:43,088
nocturnal mushrooms that fall asleep during the day.

957
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,007
so you can only use them at night.

958
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:48,830
I thought it'd be neat to have a plant that sort of broke this rule,

959
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:52,253
one that would let you use your mushrooms during the day.

960
00:48:53,054 --> 00:48:56,116
So we made the coffee bean because people associate coffee with waking up.

961
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:59,459
And thus when you see your mushrooms going zzz,

962
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,203
it makes sense that you'd want to put a coffee bean on them to wake them up.

963
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:07,466
Even the first three zombies you see in the game,

964
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:11,149
I use the idea that everyone knows that

965
00:49:12,174 --> 00:49:15,135
Metal is tougher than plastic, which is tougher than nothing at all.

966
00:49:15,635 --> 00:49:18,837
So it's pretty easy to tell which of these zombies is tougher just by looking.

967
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:22,179
And also, that's the only visual difference between the three.

968
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:29,323
People also know that magnets attract metal, so it's no surprise that magnet shrooms pull

969
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,764
the metal buckets off of zombies' heads.

970
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:34,549
We even chose our resource representation really carefully.

971
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:38,430
We chose sun because people know that plants need sun,

972
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,851
and we chose money because everyone knows that money

973
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:41,471
buys you stuff.

974
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,313
It may seem obvious, but a lot of games

975
00:49:44,353 --> 00:49:45,093
don't actually do this.

976
00:49:45,573 --> 00:49:47,994
A lot of games try to get kind of cute with their icons

977
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:49,054
and representations of things.

978
00:49:49,274 --> 00:49:50,935
For instance, we could have chosen

979
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,116
to have you collect brains here instead of money.

980
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:58,591
The problem would be that brains don't do the best job of telling the player that

981
00:49:58,892 --> 00:50:01,092
you're supposed to save them up to purchase stuff.

982
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,573
So it's little choices like this that,

983
00:50:04,353 --> 00:50:08,734
they seem relatively insignificant, but when you kind of make these, like, decisions

984
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,995
that are a little bit off and put them together,

985
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:13,115
they add up to kind of a confusing experience.

986
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:19,597
So instead, we chose to be as direct as possible and just have the zombies drop money.

987
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,696
there, I felt like there were enough other places to add flair in the game where we didn't

988
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:28,061
have to risk confusing players by getting fancy in basic areas such as this.

989
00:50:30,335 --> 00:50:33,919
Another thing people know is that diamonds are more valuable than gold, which is more

990
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:34,839
valuable than silver.

991
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,462
So I chose to base our money system in the game off of that.

992
00:50:38,623 --> 00:50:44,608
And even in the unlikely case that someone didn't know which was more valuable, I still

993
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:50,113
made each one bigger than the next, so that, again, using the idea that people generally

994
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,475
understand that bigger is better when it comes to money.

995
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:57,983
And if you're observant, you'll notice that we completely skipped the copper or bronze

996
00:50:58,023 --> 00:50:58,343
coin.

997
00:50:58,863 --> 00:51:04,165
And that's just because we chose to do that because copper can look pretty similar to

998
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:04,906
gold at times.

999
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:09,167
And in PVZ, we only needed three kinds of money, so instead of starting with copper,

1000
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:16,130
we chose to avoid any possible confusion and just start you off with silver.

1001
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,012
Even the way we named our plants took advantage of what people already knew.

1002
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:22,866
In coming up with plant names, we could have gone the route of

1003
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:25,447
pizazzing them up with names like the Vindicator,

1004
00:51:25,807 --> 00:51:30,649
but instead we chose to name our plants a little more on the direct and descriptive side,

1005
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:35,091
because that's just one more avenue of communicating to the player what the plants would do.

1006
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:39,432
So the P here is our game's basic projectile,

1007
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:43,894
and so it makes sense that the word P would be in all the plants in the game that fire them.

1008
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:48,175
The Sunflower, Walnut, Marigold, Squash,

1009
00:51:48,215 --> 00:51:49,796
they're all examples of names.

1010
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:55,128
that are deliberately crafted to communicate what they do based on things people already

1011
00:51:55,168 --> 00:51:55,368
know.

1012
00:51:56,829 --> 00:52:00,371
And to delineate the nocturnal mushrooms from the other plants, I made sure they attach

1013
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:06,275
the suffix of shroom so that even when you have a plant that looks a little bit less

1014
00:52:06,315 --> 00:52:10,398
like your typical mushroom, like that magnet shroom on the bottom right, you'd still know

1015
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:11,999
that it's a mushroom through its name.

1016
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,581
So you, thus, you would know that you could only use it at night.

1017
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:17,962
All right, so we made it.

1018
00:52:18,322 --> 00:52:20,904
So here's a recap of all the points I talked about today.

1019
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:24,346
One is to blend the tutorial into the game.

1020
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,709
Two is to better have the player do than read.

1021
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:29,931
Three is to spread out the teaching of game mechanics.

1022
00:52:30,511 --> 00:52:33,133
Four is to just get the player to do it once.

1023
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:35,715
Five is use fewer words.

1024
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:38,017
Six is use unobtrusive messaging.

1025
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,558
Seven, use adaptive messaging.

1026
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,079
Eight, don't create noise.

1027
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,720
Nine, use visuals to teach.

1028
00:52:42,841 --> 00:52:45,463
And 10, leverage what people already know.

1029
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:48,205
And the last point I was going to get into, but I don't think I have time.

1030
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,181
You take all these techniques and apply them,

1031
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:55,943
and you can make your game as easy and pleasant to learn

1032
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:57,103
as PVZ was.

1033
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:59,084
And some of these things, you can apply them

1034
00:52:59,104 --> 00:53:00,145
to games that are almost complete.

1035
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,227
But in general, you don't want to wait for the last minute

1036
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,648
to start thinking about your tutorial.

1037
00:53:05,188 --> 00:53:07,850
You really should be building the game for ease of learning

1038
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,931
right from the start so you can incorporate all these things.

1039
00:53:10,611 --> 00:53:13,133
So remember to think of the tutorial chameleon here

1040
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,094
and really blend your tutorial into the game.

1041
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,315
Like I said, the best tutorial shouldn't

1042
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:18,376
feel like tutorials at all.

1043
00:53:19,437 --> 00:53:20,077
So to conclude.

1044
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:23,145
I'd like to show you the main menu from our game.

1045
00:53:24,506 --> 00:53:26,346
And let's, let's zoom in so you can see the help button.

1046
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:31,488
So we were laying out the main menu, and I put that help button there kind of by default,

1047
00:53:31,528 --> 00:53:35,490
because I noticed that, I just noticed that every other PopCap game had a help button.

1048
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:39,112
And I kind of figured we'd do something with it at some point.

1049
00:53:39,772 --> 00:53:43,313
And the button just kind of sat there through much of development, and when you click it,

1050
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:44,054
nothing would happen.

1051
00:53:45,694 --> 00:53:48,976
So when the game was all done, and it was time to put these, these help pages in.

1052
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,508
I double-checked and I asked someone at PopCap,

1053
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:56,211
is it indeed a requirement for our games to have help pages?

1054
00:53:56,311 --> 00:53:57,432
And the answer I got was no.

1055
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:00,174
So instead of putting your typical help pages there,

1056
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:01,455
this is what our help button leads you to.

1057
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:05,018
It reads, help for plants in zombies game.

1058
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:07,180
When the zombies show up, just sit there

1059
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,021
and don't do anything.

1060
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:10,203
You win the game when the zombies get to your house.

1061
00:54:10,843 --> 00:54:12,505
This help section brought to you by the zombies.

1062
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:25,791
So I felt like we did such a good job of teaching the game

1063
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,313
already that we didn't need a help section, so we just put

1064
00:54:28,353 --> 00:54:29,434
something silly there instead.

1065
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:32,757
So hopefully I've been able to give you some perspective on

1066
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:36,000
tutorials today, and may your games teach the player so well

1067
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,063
and so effectively that your help section can also be made

1068
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:39,523
into a joke.

1069
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:41,505
And thank you.
