1
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:09,140
Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,760
It's a great pleasure for me to introduce our speaker

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,521
for this afternoon's session, Jonathan Perry.

4
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:17,502
When he sent this proposal to the advisory board,

5
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:20,063
I thought, now I can finally find out

6
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:21,483
why I'm in love with Leilana.

7
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,624
So my goal for this entire presentation

8
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,145
is to figure out how he made me fall in love

9
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:27,745
with his characters and really care about them

10
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:28,465
and worry about them.

11
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:31,947
I've seen the presentation, and it's going to be fantastic.

12
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:42,704
This is his first presentation and his first one at GDC, of course, so I ask everyone to be really gentle and to give him amazingly high scores so that he comes back and does this again, because I think this is going to be a real treat.

13
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:44,287
All right, Jonathan, knock him dead. Good luck.

14
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:46,110
Thanks a lot.

15
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:55,388
Good afternoon everyone, thanks a lot for coming. So just a few reminders before I get started,

16
00:00:55,828 --> 00:01:00,052
please if you could, silence your cell phones and keep an eye out for the email that they send to

17
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:03,576
give me a review. It'll probably end up in your spam folder so definitely check that out.

18
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:05,337
So let's get started.

19
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:06,558
My name's Jonathan Perry.

20
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:09,361
I'm a lead cinematic designer, or a cinematic lead at Bioware.

21
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,703
In my time at Bioware, I've worked on Mass Effect 1 and 2.

22
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:15,125
I've worked on all the Dragon Age titles as well,

23
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:18,167
including a lot of additional Dragon Age DLC.

24
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:21,670
So this talk is called Contrastive Juxtaposition.

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,813
And contrastive juxtaposition is really just a fancy term

26
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:27,474
for putting two things that are completely

27
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:28,615
different right next to each other

28
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,796
to create a dramatic effect.

29
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:32,078
And it's an effect that we use in our scenes

30
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:32,779
to create these.

31
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:41,084
powerful and emotional moments in our games. It involves a dramatic reversal or a rapid shift in the audio narrative or visual polarities.

32
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:43,445
So to give you an example of what I'm talking about,

33
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:47,688
I'd like to show you a scene from the very beginning of Mass Effect 2. And to set the scene,

34
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,310
the Normandy is under attack from a collector ship.

35
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,793
Most of the crew is either dead or has escaped and Joker is the only one left on board and Shepard's trying to get him

36
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,714
into an escape pod.

37
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,629
So, this scene was a really powerful and emotional moment for me in the game.

38
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,892
And part of it was because I had just lost a character that I had spent 40 or more hours

39
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,873
with in the previous game, saving the galaxy.

40
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:33,316
But it was also the manipulation of contrast and context in the scene that really made

41
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:34,057
it hit home for me.

42
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:39,120
The quick shift from being alive to dead was also supported by a dramatic shift in the

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,541
audio and the visuals as well.

44
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,824
So we'll talk about creating the timing and the content

45
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:44,764
for these types of moments.

46
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,887
We'll also take a closer look at contrast and context

47
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,708
and how they can be used as creative tools

48
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,289
throughout the development process

49
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,291
to make your scenes better.

50
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:56,073
So I'll start by talking about the role of story and cinematics

51
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:57,594
at BioWare, so a bit about the people

52
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:58,735
and the processes involved.

53
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,800
Then I'll talk about contrast and context,

54
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,042
why they're important and how they can be used to impact

55
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:05,983
the player experience.

56
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:07,724
From there, I'll discuss how contrast

57
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,926
can be used to create strong story themes

58
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,367
in a narrative possibility space,

59
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,170
how content teams can use contrast

60
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,812
to create content that supports those story themes,

61
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:20,175
and how context can be used to create a more meaningful

62
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:20,995
experience for the player.

63
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:26,460
So I'll be, spoiler alert, I'll be using a lot of great examples from Dragon Age and

64
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,742
Mass Effect, but I will be talking about Mass Effect 3 a little bit.

65
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:30,943
I've tried to keep this as spoiler light as possible.

66
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,186
If you've played the demo or you've seen the trailers, you've already seen a lot of what

67
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:35,766
I'm going to show.

68
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:38,768
But if you're one of those people who doesn't want to hear anything, doesn't want to see

69
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:43,331
anything, I'll give you a heads up before I spoil any plots for you.

70
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,412
Consider yourselves warned.

71
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,795
So as most of you already know, story is a huge part of Bioware games.

72
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:54,260
Our goal is to create the best story-driven and emotionally engaging games in the world.

73
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,622
And to that end, we have a lot of storytellers.

74
00:04:57,603 --> 00:05:06,111
So if you look at the makeup of some of our design teams on Dragon Age 2 or Mass Effect

75
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:11,376
3, you see we've got a lot of combat designers, systems designers, but about half the team

76
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,497
is made up of storytellers.

77
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:15,300
So writers, editors, cinematic designers.

78
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:20,263
And when I talk about cinematics, I'm not just talking about the pre-rendered scenes

79
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:21,024
that you see in the game.

80
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:24,606
We do those too, but every single line of cutscene is a cinematic as well.

81
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:29,229
And BioWare is a bit different from most studios in that we have two cinematic teams.

82
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,750
We have cinematic animators and cinematic designers.

83
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:36,533
So the cinematic animation team is the one that most studios have or are familiar with.

84
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,915
They create the biggest and most complex moments in the game.

85
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:43,718
So scenes like the dragon fights in Dragon Age, the epic space battles in Mass Effect 3.

86
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:47,840
They also do a lot of the complex character interactions

87
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,542
or introductions to your possible companion characters,

88
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:54,004
as well as a lot of the highly choreographed combat scenes,

89
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:56,706
ambient kill scenes, those types of moments in the game.

90
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,548
Now, cinematic designers, on the other hand,

91
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,229
work on the interactive moments in the game,

92
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,390
the interactive conversations and cut scenes.

93
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,792
And we create these using a massive library of animations.

94
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,451
We also work very closely with the writers

95
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:10,832
throughout the development process

96
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:12,673
to develop the narrative flow of the game.

97
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,735
And we design the tools for generating and iterating

98
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,798
on massive amounts of high quality interactive content

99
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:19,278
very quickly.

100
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,741
So between the two teams, we end up

101
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,482
creating about 30 hours of cinematic content

102
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:26,843
for an average BioWare game.

103
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:29,626
And we try to use all these principles

104
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,747
I'll be talking about throughout the development process

105
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:32,708
on all of this content.

106
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:38,268
So here's a very basic model of how we create the story

107
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:40,410
in the cinematics for our game.

108
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,951
So the writers create the story.

109
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,453
The content teams then create the various assets

110
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:45,634
that we need to tell that story.

111
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:48,336
And then the cinematic teams put it all together

112
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:50,218
to create the cinematic experience.

113
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,779
So we'll refer back to this model a bit

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,521
as we go through the presentation.

115
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,804
But first, I want to take a closer look

116
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:59,106
at contrast and context, how they work,

117
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,768
why they're important, and how they're used to create meaning

118
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:02,969
and shape the player experience.

119
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:07,481
So I think the picture on the right is one of my favorite pieces of concept art from

120
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,622
the Dragon Age franchise.

121
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,583
And it's a great example of contrast.

122
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:15,867
Because in the same image you see light and dark, life and death, gentleness and brutality.

123
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,929
And it's beautiful, but it's sick.

124
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,170
And I love it.

125
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:20,730
It's great.

126
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:23,232
It feels important.

127
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:24,093
It feels meaningful.

128
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,134
There's a story here.

129
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:28,916
But why is it that this contrast gets our attention?

130
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:36,696
Because like it or not, from an evolutionary point of view, we are hardwired to notice contrast or change in our environment.

131
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,577
It's a survival instinct, really.

132
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:47,465
Seeing the orange line in the green field, or hearing the twigs snap in the dead of night,

133
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:54,037
Or the smell of smoke in the air can alert you to danger in the environment, and it can

134
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:56,818
often mean the difference between life and death noticing this contrast.

135
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:57,758
It's a good thing.

136
00:07:57,798 --> 00:08:02,399
It's a built-in Spidey sense, and we use this attention to contrast all the time for survival.

137
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:07,360
But we have a hard time not noticing contrast, so it's great to use for advertising your

138
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,861
product, getting it to stand up off the shelf, getting somebody to pick it up and play it.

139
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:16,183
But in print media, this contrast occurs all at once, but when somebody's picked up the

140
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:19,123
game or is watching the movie, the rules of contrast change.

141
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:24,482
In a narrative, audiences like to see characters undergo transformative change or have a change

142
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:26,703
on the world around them over the course of the narrative.

143
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,604
We love seeing characters get thrown into these unfamiliar situations, struggle to adapt

144
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,565
and survive, and learn something in the process.

145
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,827
Now when talking about contrast or change in a narrative, I like to think of it in terms

146
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,427
of polarity.

147
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:44,708
It's still about the difference between two things, but it takes that difference and applies

148
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:46,309
it to a two-dimensional coordinate system.

149
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:49,790
So we have positive and negative polarities, and these could be anything.

150
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,695
Good versus evil is one we're all familiar with.

151
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,576
Light side versus dark side is one of my favorites.

152
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:00,637
But they don't have to fit the pattern of good and bad, or good and evil.

153
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:01,658
They just have to be different.

154
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:03,878
So up versus down, left versus right.

155
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,019
These would all work too.

156
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,462
Now visualizing contrast with a polarized system, it makes it easier to see the movement

157
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:14,962
over time.

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,484
Polarity creates conflict or struggle between two opposing forces, and it allows us to see

159
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:24,248
not just that a character is changing, but that they're changing in a direction.

160
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:27,671
So two are away from a certain state of being over the course of the narrative.

161
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:33,116
And if we want to track this, we can kind of change our model a little bit and track

162
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,238
this shifting between polarities over time.

163
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,543
So as players in a game, we like to be the ones that are driving that change in our character

164
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,384
or the world around us.

165
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:45,647
We want to choose how to play, what side to align ourselves with, who lives and who dies.

166
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,468
So we want to be the one that's driving that change.

167
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,413
So polarities or contrast is an important part of all narratives because it allows us

168
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:57,135
to create these characters with different personalities, beliefs, and values.

169
00:09:57,155 --> 00:10:00,318
And it's that difference between these characters that creates conflict.

170
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,860
And that conflict motivates a need for change or action.

171
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,424
So everyone's familiar with this scene if you've played Mass Effect 1, but this struggle

172
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:10,886
between polar opposite forces creates suspense and drama.

173
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:14,569
We all want to know who's going to win, who's going to live, who's going to die, what happens

174
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:14,889
next.

175
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:19,412
So now let's take a closer look at context.

176
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:24,055
Now when somebody asks you what a word means, the usual response is, well, what's the context,

177
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:25,395
meaning what's around it?

178
00:10:25,476 --> 00:10:30,279
Because what's around something can have a significant meaning on that experience or

179
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,380
on that thing, or an influence on that meaning.

180
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,543
So, the picture here on the right is an example of the Kuleshov effect.

181
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:42,588
And in this experiment, the Russian filmmaker, Lev Kuleshov, created a montage.

182
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,869
First, he showed a bowl of soup.

183
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,672
Then he cut to a reaction of a man's face.

184
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,014
He showed a child in a coffin.

185
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:50,856
And showed the man's face.

186
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,581
They showed a woman laying seductively on the couch and then he cut back to the man's face.

187
00:10:56,181 --> 00:11:02,048
Now the audience who watched this experiment or this piece of film were asked to comment on the actor's performance.

188
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,770
And they loved it. They raved about it.

189
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,934
What a brilliant performance. Subtly magnificent.

190
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,958
You could see the hunger when he saw that bowl of soup.

191
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,555
Oh, his sadness, that sadness when he saw that child in the coffin.

192
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:16,156
And oh, that lust in his eyes when he saw that woman.

193
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:20,057
But really, it was the same expressionless face, the guy, every single time.

194
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:24,479
So this just shows us that the audience perception of the actor's performance

195
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,561
and what it meant was heavily influenced by the surrounding content.

196
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:32,023
So the Kuleshov experiment demonstrated that the context of an experience

197
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:35,264
can often hold more meaning than the content of an experience.

198
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,847
So it was a bit hard to see in the previous example,

199
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:42,008
so I'd like to show you a more modern example of this effect

200
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,829
as demonstrated by Alfred Hitchcock.

201
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,232
Now the third way is what one might call pure cinematics,

202
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:55,633
the assembly of film,

203
00:11:57,074 --> 00:12:02,196
and how it can be changed to create a different idea.

204
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:04,077
Now have a close-up.

205
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:05,737
Then we'll share one of...

206
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:12,271
Let's assume he saw a woman holding a baby in her arms.

207
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:19,276
Now we cut back to his reaction to what he sees, and he smiles.

208
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:25,500
Now what is he as a character? He's a kind woman, he's sympathetic.

209
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:31,464
Now, let's take the middle piece of film away, the woman with the child,

210
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:34,566
but leave his two pieces of film as they were.

211
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:35,727
Now we'll put it...

212
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,142
a piece of film of a girl in a bikini.

213
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:48,211
He looks, girl in a bikini, he smiles.

214
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:51,254
What is he laughing at? A dirty old man.

215
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:56,179
He's no longer the benign gentleman who loves babies.

216
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,382
That's what's different. That's what's wrong.

217
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:02,834
Well, it seems like that was a little out of sync,

218
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:04,075
but you get the idea.

219
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:07,416
By changing one image in a sequence of shots,

220
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:09,496
you can change the meaning of that entire sequence.

221
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:13,818
In this case, he loves babies, or he's a dirty old man.

222
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,178
So we do this a lot in Bioware games,

223
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:18,679
and the image or the sequence that we kind of swap out

224
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,920
is influenced by your previous decisions,

225
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,000
creating a more meaningful and personal experience

226
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,481
for the player.

227
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,961
So we'll talk about some additional forms of context

228
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,082
in a bit, but the important thing to keep in mind here

229
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:30,263
is that we can manipulate the order.

230
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:34,926
or context of events to enhance meaning or create meaning that would not have been there

231
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:35,346
otherwise.

232
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,671
So now that we've covered some of the basics of contrast and context, I'd like to take

233
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:47,893
a look at how we can apply these ideas to improve our story and content in our games.

234
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,456
So contrast and context are used as creative tools when developing a strong narrative theme

235
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:57,618
for your game and to start to fill out that world with characters and missions that the

236
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:58,999
player can explore through choice.

237
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,848
So the first thing we try to do when working on a new game is to identify the theme of

238
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:05,168
the game.

239
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:09,349
So if your game is more than just a bunch of mechanics holding hands, what do you want

240
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:09,789
it to mean?

241
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,370
If your game has a story, what is the story you want to tell?

242
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,652
So this can be hard, but it's important to establish these themes very early because

243
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,632
they can inform design further down the line.

244
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:21,592
And this is hard.

245
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,853
The way I like to think of it at first is versus.

246
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:27,214
So something versus something.

247
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:28,394
Someone versus something.

248
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,180
In the case of Dragon Age, it would be Grey Wardens versus the Darkspawn.

249
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,982
Or in Mass Effect, Reapers versus humanity.

250
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:41,524
So once you've established the major players, think about what each side represents.

251
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:46,806
So if your game is about a conflict between two forces, what is it they're in disagreement

252
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:47,006
over?

253
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:50,267
What beliefs, ideals, or background does each side represent?

254
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,828
And these can be deeper or more abstract themes that don't necessarily have to fit into the

255
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:56,089
pattern of good versus evil, right versus wrong.

256
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,310
So for example, in Mass Effect 3...

257
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:03,996
Humanity represents innocence, free will, and a force of chaos in the world, whereas

258
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,980
the Reapers represent authority, determinism, and wanting to restore order.

259
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,843
And we started to explore these themes with content very early in the game, starting with

260
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,085
the first shot in Mass Effect 3, so let's take a look.

261
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:51,690
So we start with this boy playing with this toy ship, but it's more than that.

262
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,773
This is the only child we've ever seen in the Mass Effect universe.

263
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,236
He stands out by contrast, and that's a good thing.

264
00:15:57,276 --> 00:16:00,520
He seems important, because we want this boy to represent something.

265
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,282
We want him to represent humanity.

266
00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:03,824
He's young and innocent.

267
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:07,468
He's got his whole life ahead of him to make decisions, make choices, to shape his own

268
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:07,869
destiny.

269
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,866
And then we cut to Shepard watching.

270
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,807
So this is really similar to the Hitchcock clip

271
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:13,647
that we watched earlier.

272
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:14,887
We see a boy playing.

273
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,788
We cut to Shepard and she smiles.

274
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,388
So what does that say about her as a character?

275
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:21,829
It says that she loves humanity and she wants to protect it.

276
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,270
And we see this as we kind of go through

277
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,071
the opening of the game, the Reapers attack.

278
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,951
She tries to coax this boy out of a vent.

279
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,792
And then later she watches him board this shuttle

280
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:32,592
to get out of the city.

281
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:34,473
And by this point, you realize that this boy

282
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,113
represents everything that you're fighting for.

283
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:36,994
Everything you're gonna spend

284
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:38,454
the rest of the game fighting for.

285
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:41,688
So we explore similar themes in Dragon Age 2.

286
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,010
Themes like free will versus fate,

287
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,672
being an individual versus being part of a larger community,

288
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,833
and the balance between freedom and security.

289
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:51,954
So early on, look at your game,

290
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,295
think about what are the different sides,

291
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:54,135
what do they represent,

292
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:56,677
when establishing the major conflicts

293
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:57,777
and story themes of your game.

294
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:00,559
So we also use contrast and context

295
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:01,980
when starting to create the world

296
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,301
and flesh out the world of our games.

297
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:07,498
And when doing this, it's important to think of contrast or polarity as a meta pattern.

298
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:09,420
It exists on all these different levels in your game.

299
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,442
So think of all these levels when trying to build out your IP or build out your story.

300
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:18,646
And even if conflicts or struggles on certain levels aren't necessarily central to your game,

301
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:23,029
they can be really useful for creating context, explaining why things are the way they are,

302
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,530
why people behave the way they do.

303
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,371
And so going through this, you could have polarized states of reality.

304
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:34,813
In Mass Effect 3, Shepard's fighting a war against the Reapers in reality, but also explores

305
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,554
the world of her subconscious through her dreams.

306
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:42,256
At a galaxy level, the entire galaxy is engaged in a war with the Reapers, but within that

307
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:45,537
galaxy we have worlds and polarized conflicts between these worlds.

308
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,838
For example, between the Krogans and the Solarians.

309
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,039
Within every world, you have conflict between groups.

310
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:54,260
For example, the Mages versus the Templars in Dragon Age 2.

311
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:59,312
And within every group you have polarization within these smaller groups.

312
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:03,958
For example, the mages in Dragon Age 2 represent a larger group, but within that group you've

313
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:09,484
got circle mages, blood mages, apostate mages, all kind of doing their own thing, all having

314
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:10,586
their own goals and agendas.

315
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:15,391
There's also individuals that compose every group and they represent various polarities.

316
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:19,855
In our game, every companion character stands for or against something.

317
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:24,657
So there's different personalities represented in clashes and goals, beliefs, and character,

318
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:28,659
and inevitable. And this makes for some really great content. The banter between the different

319
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:33,221
character combinations in Dragon Age is hilarious because it draws so heavily on this contrastive

320
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:36,343
juxtaposition of characters at odds with each other for comedic effect.

321
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,813
There's also conflict within every individual.

322
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,954
So Fenris, for example, hates mages,

323
00:18:42,114 --> 00:18:43,635
but he also hates slavery.

324
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:46,097
So what do you do when you see a bunch of mages being enslaved?

325
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,279
So within an individual, there can be a struggle between

326
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:51,721
revenge and forgiveness, love and hate,

327
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,122
trust and suspicion.

328
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:54,423
So think of all these different things.

329
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:58,025
This is also, there's polarities within the player.

330
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,187
Who does support or oppose?

331
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:01,007
Who lives and dies?

332
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:02,308
Are you going to play Paragon, or are you

333
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:03,109
going to play Renegade?

334
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,530
So we let the player influence the world around him

335
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,451
through these choices.

336
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:12,184
And as much as possible, we want these choices to be meaningful and to have a real impact

337
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,904
on the world or the people around you.

338
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:20,786
In previous Mass Effect games, the player usually had these paragon, neutral, or renegade

339
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:21,926
options in any situation.

340
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:27,887
We love giving players choices, but this neutral response is essentially the meh of the conversation

341
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:28,127
wheel.

342
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:29,587
It's, I don't care, what do you guys think?

343
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:30,527
I don't know, what do you want to do?

344
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:36,268
So it didn't do anything to shift the player towards one side of a polarized conflict or

345
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:36,548
the other.

346
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,548
It was more in the middle.

347
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,172
So in Mass Effect 3, one thing you'll notice that's different is in most cases this middle

348
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:42,913
option is gone.

349
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:47,216
In this game, there's a lot at stake, there's a lot of really big decisions to make, a lot

350
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:49,457
of really huge consequences.

351
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,279
So we're not just going to let you sit on the fence and let somebody else figure it

352
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:52,719
out for you.

353
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,702
And the interesting thing is that even with this middle option removed, it still feels

354
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,163
more like a role-playing game.

355
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,945
Choices are harder and have real consequence.

356
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,266
The choices are tough.

357
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,976
So while the player has control over the polar alignment of their own character,

358
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:13,162
it's interesting to see the effects that player's choice and action can have on the companion characters in the game.

359
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:19,589
So every one of these characters has a unique collection of attributes, behaviors, and values that define them as a character.

360
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,472
And while these don't change much over the course of time,

361
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,576
the choices you make as a player influence your relationship with these various characters.

362
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,791
In Dragon Age Origins, for example, your followers had very clear opinions on what was wrong

363
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:34,393
or right, and these didn't really change much over the course of the narrative.

364
00:20:35,394 --> 00:20:38,616
When you were making a major decision, they'd let you know how they felt about it, what

365
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:42,980
they thought you should do, and based on how you responded, you would either get approval

366
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,922
or disapproval points from each follower.

367
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:50,106
High approval points improved the follower's combat performance in the game, would open

368
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:54,610
up the door to a possible romantic relationship with some characters, and people with a low

369
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,411
approval rating might leave your party.

370
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:01,598
So we use, uh, Mike this is for you buddy, uh, the player's relationship with Leleana.

371
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:06,322
My, my relationship with Leleana is a great example of how different things could be and

372
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:09,005
a great example of contrastive juxtaposition in the narrative.

373
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:12,548
So Lele and I, Leleana and I, we were in love.

374
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:17,873
Um, I gave her all these gifts, I had high approval rating through the roof, and I was

375
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:18,774
totally romancing her.

376
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:20,075
Uh, but.

377
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:23,709
One decision I made in the Temple of Sacred Ashes,

378
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,630
she really disagreed with so strongly that she came at me

379
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,790
and in a fight to the death, I had to kill her.

380
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,631
And this is great contrast of juxtaposition.

381
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,771
She went from my friend to my enemy,

382
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:36,732
and alive to dead in this that moment in the player of,

383
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,052
oh my God, what have I done?

384
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:40,913
I reloaded.

385
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:45,614
So.

386
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,534
back to the approval system as this polarized system, overall it was very clear and it worked

387
00:21:51,574 --> 00:22:01,004
very well. So, disapproval is bad, approval is good, the system worked well, it was clear

388
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:02,045
and players understood it.

389
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,798
Some players felt like the system kind of limited the choices they could make.

390
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:10,061
Everybody wanted high approval ratings from their followers, so

391
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:13,543
sometimes they felt like they couldn't choose what they wanted to, they had to choose what the

392
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,345
followers that were with them wanted,

393
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:17,947
or that they could only take along the followers on the quest

394
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:21,489
that would agree with whatever decisions they wanted to play, the style they wanted to play in.

395
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,313
So we wanted players to feel free to make their own choices, so we tried to tweak this a little bit in Dragon Age 2.

396
00:22:27,936 --> 00:22:30,377
So we created this friendship and rivalry system,

397
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,357
and the idea was similar.

398
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:34,758
Players or followers would move towards one side

399
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:36,439
or the other of this scale,

400
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:38,280
based on whether they agreed with your actions or not.

401
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,061
The difference here was that rivalry wasn't bad.

402
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:44,762
Achieving a high rivalry value with your follower character

403
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:46,463
triggered this dramatic conversation

404
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:48,143
where you'd hash out your differences,

405
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:50,224
agree to disagree, I don't like what you're doing

406
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,405
but I respect you type of thing,

407
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:53,285
and it would open up those combat perks,

408
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,106
open up the door to these romantic relationships.

409
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,112
your relationship with this player or character would improve as a result of this big argument.

410
00:23:01,472 --> 00:23:04,074
So, high friendship and high rivalry were both good,

411
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,916
but players were used to the old system from Dragon Age Origins

412
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,819
and didn't really understand their rivalry wasn't bad.

413
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,280
And looking back at it, it's easy to understand why.

414
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:16,003
Because we presented it as this polarized system, except in this case...

415
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:21,427
Friendship and rivalry were both good, and OK, it's bad to be in the middle, but the

416
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:25,509
color scale on that, it kind of looks like the old Paragon Renegade system, and so we

417
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,930
can see how players got confused.

418
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:31,994
So the important thing here is when creating these polarized systems, or things that look

419
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:35,656
like polarized systems, make it clear to your player what the different sides are, what

420
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:38,758
they do, especially if the systems change from a previous iteration.

421
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:43,561
So we also use contrast when designing the missions or the quests in our games.

422
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:51,697
Now once you know the plot of a mission, or this could be applied to a conversation, an

423
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,198
act, the entire game, a great exercise is to map out the narrative beats.

424
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,319
So you can see these little ticks on the bottom of this image.

425
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:03,742
So pick one of your polarities and think about what side you want the player to be exposed

426
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:08,644
to at any point throughout the mission of the game, at each of these narrative beats.

427
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,725
So whether it's how you want them to feel, or what side of a conflict you want them to

428
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,326
identify with or to expose them to.

429
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:20,472
And then we can make sure we expose players to both sides of a polarized conflict before

430
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:22,634
letting them choose which side to align themselves with.

431
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:25,897
And we've been trying to get away from these good versus evil type of choices.

432
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:27,839
Really we want to give you a hard choice.

433
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,480
Shades of grey.

434
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,002
We want to make you pick between shades of grey.

435
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:33,204
There is no right or wrong, but you've got to choose anyway.

436
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:37,648
So this exercise is great for making sure that each of these different sides of a polarized

437
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,349
conflict gets the proper exposure.

438
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,153
And this back and forth between players also does a great job of keeping players engaged.

439
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,492
Alright, so this is the part if you want to close your ears or eyes, uh, don't listen

440
00:24:49,512 --> 00:24:50,912
to this if you don't want to spoil for it.

441
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:51,592
It's really not that bad.

442
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:55,234
But, uh, so we're going to take a look at a mission from the middle of Mass Effect 3.

443
00:24:55,634 --> 00:25:00,695
Now, if you've played the demo, uh, you'll know that, uh, one of the missions involved

444
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:05,617
helping Morden escort this female Krogan out of a Solarian facility because she represents

445
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:09,478
a possible cure for the genophage, which has been a huge issue since the beginning of Mass

446
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:09,778
Effect 1.

447
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:16,077
So in this later mission, you have to help Morden get this female Krogan to the Shroud

448
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:20,181
facility on Tachanka to release this cure into the atmosphere, curing the genophage

449
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:22,744
so that the Krogan will join you in the war against the Reapers.

450
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,907
But before setting off on this mission, you get a secret message.

451
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:29,715
letting you know that there's a secret way to sabotage this cure

452
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:31,495
in such a way that the Krogan will never know.

453
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:34,356
So the Krogan will think you helped him out, they'll help you in the war,

454
00:25:34,956 --> 00:25:36,957
but the genophage will still be in place.

455
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:40,658
At this point, you don't have to decide, but you know you have two options.

456
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,658
You can sabotage the cure or assist the Krogans.

457
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:47,939
So to make it easy to chart this out over our narrative map,

458
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,760
we can put the action events that support sabotaging the cure on top,

459
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:55,161
and the events that support assisting the group on the bottom,

460
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:56,221
or on the top.

461
00:25:57,336 --> 00:26:00,166
uh... these roughly correspond to uh... paragon a renegade options that will

462
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:00,707
track it like that

463
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:13,024
So, on the way, this Krogan leader who's kind of helping you out, he's all about getting

464
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:18,746
revenge on the Salarians. After today, the Krogan superiority will be obvious to everyone.

465
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:22,547
So he's already planning his revenge. You meet up with a bunch of other Krogans and

466
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:25,668
they start fighting amongst themselves, even though they should be working together towards

467
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:29,429
this common goal. You see how vicious and cruel these Krogans are to each other. So

468
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,591
at this point the player is thinking, maybe sabotaging the cure isn't such a bad idea.

469
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:38,239
But then this female Krogan comes out, she gets them to stop fighting.

470
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:43,283
The groups unite, you load up, you roll out, the music is inspiring, let's do this thing, right?

471
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:45,084
On the way there, she's telling Reeve,

472
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:48,726
we need a leader who's not focused on war.

473
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:52,408
We've spread war across the galaxy before, and the genophage was the result, so

474
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,311
we need to learn from the mistakes of our ancestors, or be doomed to repeat them.

475
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:04,186
Okay, awesome! Maybe all these Krogan need is a strong female Krogan, uh, keep them in line, keep them in order, unite them as a group.

476
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:09,168
So, I could see how this could work, maybe, uh, maybe helping them out's not such a bad idea after all.

477
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,029
But Reeve's not buying it, so he's still determined to get revenge.

478
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:17,451
You step outside and look around you and you see how destroyed the world is,

479
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,692
how the Krogans grew tired of a peaceful life and started nuclear wars with each other,

480
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,913
destroying their world long before the Solarians implemented the Genophage.

481
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:27,554
Uh, okay, hmm.

482
00:27:30,572 --> 00:27:34,774
But then we also show the player that Krogan's were once a peaceful and advanced society.

483
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:36,275
They weren't always creatures of war.

484
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:38,256
And you can see this in their architecture.

485
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:42,218
And their art.

486
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:46,180
So there's a sense of wonder here, a sense of history, and you can imagine how things

487
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,981
were long ago and might be again.

488
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:53,184
So I'm going to stop spoiling this for you, but there's a lot more I won't spoil.

489
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:57,886
But you can see how we expose the player to both sides of a polarized issue before making

490
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,366
them choose.

491
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:02,178
how to align themselves. And these are tough choices.

492
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,681
Eventually you've got to make a decision. You've seen how vengeful and vicious these

493
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:12,363
Krogan can be, how they wage wars against each other, destroy their own world, but you've

494
00:28:12,383 --> 00:28:16,565
also seen how hard they fought for their future, what they had been and could be again, and

495
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:20,707
how a strong female Krogan might just inspire them to a peaceful greatness once again.

496
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,287
And so now you have a narrative map

497
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,509
that you can use when working with the content teams.

498
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:29,510
So you can start thinking about how

499
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,592
you can use various content to support

500
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,473
the different sides of these polarized issues.

501
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:39,678
So moving on to creating the content.

502
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:41,760
Once you've established the high level story

503
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,902
theme and polarities, you want to create

504
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:44,943
content that supports them.

505
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:47,925
So this is all about creating the language with visuals

506
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:50,087
and audio to develop unique identities

507
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:51,328
for the different sides of the conflict.

508
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,071
for the various people and the places you'll encounter

509
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:55,112
over the course of the game.

510
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:58,314
And you also want to think about how the visual or audio design

511
00:28:58,354 --> 00:28:59,835
can change over the course of the narrative.

512
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:03,898
And provide feedback to the player

513
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:06,059
about the state of the world and how it's reacting

514
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,160
to your choices as a player.

515
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:11,782
So now when I talk about content,

516
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,984
I'm talking about the VO, the characters, level, animation,

517
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,806
sound effects, music, visual effects, all this stuff.

518
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:19,047
There's a lot of content that goes

519
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:20,168
into creating the experience.

520
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:23,205
So at this point, good communication is essential.

521
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,107
This process can end up being a bit like a game of telephone,

522
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:29,109
where from the story side, things are pretty clear.

523
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:31,110
But once it goes out to the different content teams

524
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,011
and it goes through their various pipelines and workflows,

525
00:29:34,912 --> 00:29:37,433
the message can get diluted or lost in translation.

526
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:41,094
And it's often the case that when it comes out on the other side and we combine it together

527
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,215
to create this experience, all these assets aren't telling the same story.

528
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:50,457
So it might be that the tone of the music or the VO isn't right for the scene or a character's

529
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:53,738
appearance doesn't accurately reflect their personality.

530
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:56,498
And when it doesn't work, it's really obvious.

531
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,039
Here's a great example from...

532
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,811
Dragon Age 2 Legacy DLC.

533
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:08,115
This character is Larius and he's an old Grey Warden commander who goes off to the deep

534
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:10,737
roads on his calling to die fighting Darkspawn.

535
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:14,479
Except he doesn't really die, he just gets corrupted enough that they leave him alone

536
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:17,361
so he's left to wander around slowly losing his mind.

537
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,262
Okay, okay, yeah, I got it, I got it.

538
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:22,864
So we go off and somebody records the animation for him,

539
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,226
somebody else records the VO for him,

540
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:27,527
and the character team is working on his character.

541
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:28,928
And it wasn't until we put it all together

542
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:30,989
that we realized how wrong we were,

543
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:33,030
how different our understanding of who this character was.

544
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:35,972
So he's hobbling around like this spry young monkey,

545
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,454
and he's talking like a weezy-geezer,

546
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:42,496
and he looks like this nuclear fallout victim,

547
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,537
and we put it all together and it was wrong,

548
00:30:44,597 --> 00:30:45,438
it was all wrong.

549
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:50,775
So we ended up having to go and re-record the animations.

550
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:51,676
We had to get new mocap.

551
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:53,218
We had to go and re-record the VO.

552
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:54,759
We had to tweak his character.

553
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,723
And we ended up spending a lot of time and money

554
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,365
to fix this problem.

555
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:02,047
So what could we have done differently?

556
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:03,469
How could we have done this better?

557
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,031
Surely more documentation, right?

558
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:08,314
More documentation's always the answer.

559
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:15,825
wrong. So sometimes excessive documentation can be the problem. At Bioware, we are occasionally

560
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:19,910
guilty of writing narrative overviews like George R. R. Martin wrote a choose your own

561
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:26,018
adventure book. So I once made the mistake of printing these narrative overviews out.

562
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:28,161
I've got a little time to do a bit of light reading, right?

563
00:31:29,689 --> 00:31:32,591
and the resulting stack of papers was absolutely overwhelming.

564
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:33,791
And it's now that I realize that,

565
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:35,853
maybe I have to read through this,

566
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,894
but a lot of the content developers and creators

567
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,236
aren't going to read through this massive stack of papers,

568
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:43,158
so they're going to remain unaware of the central themes of the game.

569
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,780
So instead, they'll kind of resort to creating content that's cool.

570
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,501
And cool content is cool, right?

571
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:52,424
But it doesn't necessarily support the theme of the game as well as it could.

572
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:59,451
Now we could have avoided this whole catastrophe if we just spent five minutes and used contrast

573
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:02,472
to talk about where the characters sat between these different polarities.

574
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:06,895
The process is really about communication and making sure that everyone understands

575
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:08,816
what something is and what something's not.

576
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,558
Now we want everything to support the story.

577
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:18,021
The teams responsible for telling the narrative, the audio, and the visuals, and the gameplay

578
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,283
elements should all be telling the same story with their work.

579
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:25,227
So communication is obviously key here and it's not just about communicating more information

580
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:29,971
but about boiling that giant stack of papers down to easy to understand ideas.

581
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,004
So the idea is to keep it simple, right?

582
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,845
When communicating the story vision with the content teams,

583
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:36,526
you want to be able to give them a clear idea

584
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:38,807
of the polarities that you want to explore,

585
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:40,928
and then let them decide how to support

586
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:43,009
those narrative polarities with polarities

587
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,690
within their own disciplines.

588
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:53,374
So artists can use visual polarities

589
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:54,515
to support the narrative themes.

590
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:57,560
And this goes back to the basics of visual design.

591
00:32:58,321 --> 00:32:59,943
Does the villain dress in black?

592
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:01,544
Does the good guy wear a white hat?

593
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,987
So getting back to the basics, you

594
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,088
want to be able to see a character

595
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,352
and immediately know and have a good idea of what he represents,

596
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:10,214
who they are, and what do they want.

597
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:16,120
So familiarize yourself with the basic visual components.

598
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:20,089
visual design and how they can be used to tell a story or convey emotion.

599
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:25,211
So visual components like line, color, shape, space, movement, tone, rhythm.

600
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,712
Think about what each side represents and how they can support narrative polarities.

601
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:34,094
Now it's kind of meta here, but the opposite of contrast is affinity.

602
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:38,175
So sometimes it's not about making things look different, but making different groups

603
00:33:38,255 --> 00:33:39,715
look like they belong together.

604
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,762
So for example, we used color, shape, and patterns

605
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:49,305
to make these different groups of Templars or Grey Wardens

606
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:50,606
kind of look like they belong together.

607
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:54,489
A great example is the Darkspawn in Dragon Age Origins.

608
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:56,670
They all looked really cool, but they were all very different.

609
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:58,932
They didn't really look like they belonged together.

610
00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:02,274
And we wanted them to seem like they should be together,

611
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,495
like a family.

612
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:10,646
So we used tone and color to make these guys look like they belong in a group.

613
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,709
In Mass Effect 3, it's immediately clear who the bad guys are.

614
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:18,172
If you see these little glowy blue dots and it's running at you, start shooting and get the hell out of there.

615
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:25,839
Now, visual polarities are also great for showing character progression or for externalizing the interior qualities of a character.

616
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,021
This is a great example for Mass Effect.

617
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:32,293
So if Shepard plays as a thinking, sympathetic paragon,

618
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:33,353
he looks more human.

619
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:36,614
Whereas if he plays more renegade,

620
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,675
thinking or not thinking, more logical and unfeeling,

621
00:34:40,876 --> 00:34:42,496
he starts to look more like a machine.

622
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:43,677
His skin starts to split,

623
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:45,317
revealing these cybernetics beneath.

624
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,118
And this is great because it reflects

625
00:34:47,158 --> 00:34:51,279
that larger story theme of humanity versus reapers

626
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,760
or humanity versus technology.

627
00:34:55,232 --> 00:34:56,632
And think about how color can tell a story.

628
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:59,374
For example, the red in this scene could represent danger.

629
00:35:00,314 --> 00:35:03,075
Or think about how the polarities of light and dark can tell a story.

630
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,537
In this case, transition from life to death.

631
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,318
So the same thing with audio polarities.

632
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:13,321
Think about the basic audio components, whether it's volume, pitch, speed, rhythm.

633
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:17,843
So figure out what the polarities are and think about how they could be used to represent

634
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:18,943
the different sides of the story.

635
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,298
Things like, you know, all these.

636
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:24,199
And in Dragon Age 2, we use the polarities

637
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,839
of known versus unknown when doing the ambient sound design.

638
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,619
So for example, we wanted Kirkwall

639
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,360
to feel like your home.

640
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,280
It's a familiar place.

641
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,480
You spend a lot of time there.

642
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,620
We want you to feel safe there.

643
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,560
So the ambient sound design is full

644
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,101
of real and familiar sounds.

645
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,541
Kids playing, dogs barking, merchants shouting.

646
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,962
But by contrast, when you venture outside of Kirkwall,

647
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:45,642
the locations are full of unreal and otherworldly sounds.

648
00:35:45,702 --> 00:35:47,142
It's strange and unfamiliar.

649
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,423
It creates this sense of danger in comparison.

650
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:56,126
Same thing with the music, using rhythm and tone in the music to represent the different

651
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:59,967
sides of a polarized conflict like the Templars versus the Mages in Dragon Age.

652
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,988
The music changes as the player completes quests for the different sides.

653
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:10,189
It has a mystical sound when pursuing these Mage-related quests and a more structured,

654
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,250
ordered, militant sound when pursuing Templar-related quests.

655
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,851
So I love working in cinematics because we get to take all this great, meaningful content

656
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,492
and put it together, and then we add our own layer of meaning on top.

657
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,413
The camera can tell a story too, and it's a powerful tool in creating an experience.

658
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:32,118
So things like the camera angle, lens, shot composition, camera movement, these all tell

659
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:32,578
a story.

660
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:37,302
So again, it's important to understand what the different cinematic components are and

661
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:40,144
how they can be used to create meaning or support the story that you're trying to tell.

662
00:36:43,086 --> 00:36:45,868
For example, the camera angle can make a character look weak and vulnerable.

663
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:52,272
or powerful and oppressive. In this case, it again reflects the larger theme of humanity

664
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:58,874
versus the reapers. Just tilting the camera can make a world seem chaotic and out of balance.

665
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:07,416
A close-up is personal, while a long shot feels detached. And we can combine these elements

666
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:12,197
to create more complex shots, more complex emotions. In this case, a feeling of detachment

667
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,878
or distance from your character in this world that's out of balance.

668
00:37:17,623 --> 00:37:20,063
So we can also use spatial context to add meaning through,

669
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,324
a lot of people call this environmental storytelling.

670
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:25,265
So in Dragon Age 2,

671
00:37:25,465 --> 00:37:27,145
we wanted to give the followers their own space

672
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,326
that can further reflect their personalities.

673
00:37:29,406 --> 00:37:30,866
For example, we've got Varric here

674
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:31,986
and he's got books behind him.

675
00:37:32,006 --> 00:37:33,587
He's a storyteller and that reflects that.

676
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:35,267
Him sitting in this chair,

677
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,568
kind of mirrors him sitting in a chair,

678
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:39,988
telling more stories in an interrogation room

679
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:40,868
in the framing narrative.

680
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:44,537
And this is fun, this is a lot of fun.

681
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:49,721
It's a great example of working with your level artists to tell a story outside of dialogue.

682
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:55,505
So Thane, for example, is this badass lizard assassin, and so we stick him in this assassin's

683
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:58,888
aquarium with these fluorescent lights and guns everywhere.

684
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:05,233
And the environment around the player can serve to remind them of the things they've

685
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:07,315
done, the adventures and the quests that they've already gone through.

686
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:15,491
So now that you've used contrast and context to create your story, to create content that

687
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:18,853
supports that story in the narrative themes of your game, you can put them all together

688
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:20,454
and everything's telling the same story, right?

689
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:24,397
Well, when this works, it is absolutely amazing.

690
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:29,261
There's a dream sequence in Mass Effect 3, and it's very emotionally powerful and it

691
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:31,403
stuck with me for a long time after playing the game.

692
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,822
And in contrast to the real world, this dream world is desaturated and foggy.

693
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,964
Your movement is slow and heavy.

694
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,986
The sounds are strange and the music is haunting.

695
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:46,430
And it really stands out from the rest of the game because the narrative, the visuals,

696
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:50,694
the audio and the cinematography are all working together to create this experience for the player.

697
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:57,367
Now, we also use reflective context to further shape the player experience.

698
00:38:57,947 --> 00:39:01,351
We want your current experience to be shaped by your previous choices and actions.

699
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:06,818
So this takes a player experience and makes it a personal experience.

700
00:39:07,118 --> 00:39:09,501
And that's how you take players and turn them into fans.

701
00:39:10,388 --> 00:39:13,290
So for example, your experience of the Genophage mission I described earlier,

702
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,532
it could be completely different if you didn't kill Rex in Mass Effect 1.

703
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:18,693
It's pretty hard not to kill Rex.

704
00:39:19,173 --> 00:39:22,476
And so if he's still alive, it means that you've pursued this relationship with him,

705
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:24,057
you've got a strong relationship with him,

706
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:27,979
you understand how he thinks, how he feels, a bit more about the Krogan history,

707
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:29,720
and how he could potentially be a leader.

708
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,642
So it definitely has an impact on that experience of that mission.

709
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:38,589
So your previous actions also influence the choices that you have in future conversations.

710
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,292
We've got thousands of choices in our games, and every one that you make opens up or closes

711
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:44,713
off future choices.

712
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:49,616
So some people occasionally lament the lack of choices, but not realizing that the choices

713
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:53,739
available to them at any point in these Bioware games are based on how they've been playing

714
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:54,459
the game so far.

715
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,681
Now we want you also to see your choices reflected in the cinematics.

716
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:02,324
And this is something that...

717
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,114
we could have done a lot better in Dragon Age Origins.

718
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:06,516
If you've played it,

719
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,559
you might be familiar with the murder knife.

720
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:14,994
Now, this was this kind of weird, wooden handle, dinky kitchen knife.

721
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:21,439
And at various points throughout the game, you had this opportunity to kill various NPCs for whatever reason.

722
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:29,744
And when you did so, I always wanted to kill them with this giant two-sided axe with purple electricity and flame shooting out that I've been carrying around for like 20 levels.

723
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:36,609
But when I killed this guy, I kind of pulled this knife out from behind my back and you throw it or swing it or...

724
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,536
We had all sorts of these scenes and it was really a missed opportunity to do something

725
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:45,998
unique and show the player killing a guy in a way that was consistent with how he built

726
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:47,978
his character and how he'd been playing the game so far.

727
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:53,500
So for Dragon Age 2, this was really important to me to fix this and allow the player to

728
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,502
kill somebody with their weapon in a way that was consistent with their character, how they'd

729
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,442
been playing the game so far.

730
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,776
So just as an example, you can definitely

731
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:04,737
see the results in Dragon Age 2 and the Dragon Age 2 DLC.

732
00:41:04,777 --> 00:41:07,438
This is a few examples of a cinematic kill scene

733
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,178
where you take out a boss in various ways,

734
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:12,399
depending on whether you're an archer, a rogue, or a mage.

735
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:14,839
So this creates a very personal experience

736
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:16,819
for the player, which is much, much, much more satisfying.

737
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,520
Now we also use temporal context to help

738
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
shape the player experience.

739
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,401
Now in BioWare games in particular,

740
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,121
you have a lot of freedom in where you go, what you do,

741
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:27,242
what order you do things in.

742
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:31,738
So when working on any conversation or cut scenes, we have to be aware of, well, what

743
00:41:31,758 --> 00:41:32,739
has the player already done?

744
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:34,120
What does he still have left to do?

745
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,821
What does he know?

746
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:36,483
What does he not know at any point in the game?

747
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,586
And sometimes timing is important.

748
00:41:39,946 --> 00:41:43,590
In Mass Effect 2, if you don't go save your crew fast enough after they get kidnapped

749
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,533
by the collectors, a lot of them die, including Kelly Chambers.

750
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:52,118
Who's going to feed your fish now?

751
00:41:55,968 --> 00:42:00,991
So this is also important when creating the DLC for Dragon Age 2 because the player can

752
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:03,452
play this DLC at any point in time in the main game.

753
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:06,333
They can play in Act 1, Act 2, or Act 3 during the main playthrough.

754
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:11,415
And a lot of consideration had to be given to what was a player's previous experiences

755
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:13,256
and how could they shape the current experience.

756
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:15,436
So just as an example.

757
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:20,548
In the Dragon Age 2 DLC Legacy, Hawk learns a bit about the true nature of his father.

758
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:24,369
And it was really important to us that Hawk be able to have this discussion with his mother

759
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,710
to talk about what he had discovered.

760
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,711
But depending on when you played this DLC in relation to the main game, Hawk's mother

761
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:33,412
could be alive, missing, or dead.

762
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:37,073
So we had to figure out how to make this scene in all these different cases.

763
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:42,919
and make it meaningful. So in the case of Hawk's mother being dead, we set up the scene,

764
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:47,183
we use these cinematic polarities to create this effect where it's really Hawk having

765
00:42:47,203 --> 00:42:51,828
this conversation with a memory of his mother. And this allows us to add more emotional weight

766
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:57,413
to the scene. Now, occasionally players are able to play through your content in a way

767
00:42:57,433 --> 00:42:58,914
that you might not have expected.

768
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:03,508
In Dragon Age Origins, the party camp was this safe place where you could go and equip

769
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:07,069
your gear, chat with your followers, pursue romances, and it was a safe place.

770
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:08,730
You never got attacked in the party camp.

771
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,072
Except for that one time we thought it'd be cool to attack you in the player camp, right?

772
00:43:13,512 --> 00:43:17,514
So you get attacked, you take out these bad guys, and you're covered head to toe in blood.

773
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:21,035
But you just kind of go back to business as usual, chatting with your followers, swapping

774
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:23,136
gear, pursuing romantic relationships.

775
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:26,517
And these romantic relationships, they take a lot of time.

776
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:32,766
to get to, so we wanted these to be sweet and sensual, there's nice romantic music playing,

777
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:38,809
but in this case, in this case you were covered in blood.

778
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:46,592
So what was supposed to be this sweet romantic scene ends up just being disturbingly bizarre

779
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:47,353
and hilarious.

780
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,942
because of what the player had done previously.

781
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:52,523
And this is not what we wanted.

782
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,483
This isn't what I wanted when I created this scene.

783
00:43:54,523 --> 00:43:55,223
It was all wrong.

784
00:43:55,984 --> 00:43:59,064
So the lesson here is that when you craft these key moments

785
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:01,625
in your game, just be aware of what the player might

786
00:44:01,665 --> 00:44:03,486
be able to do before and how it could potentially

787
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,646
sabotage your efforts.

788
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:08,107
So back to contrastive juxtaposition.

789
00:44:08,927 --> 00:44:11,268
So now that we've talked about contrast and context

790
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:14,129
when creating your story, your content, and your cinematics,

791
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:16,429
how do we use all these together to create

792
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:17,050
these powerful?

793
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:19,278
emotionally engaging scenes.

794
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,120
So, first I'd like to give you kind of a simple example

795
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:26,622
of contrastive juxtaposition in music.

796
00:44:27,322 --> 00:44:29,163
Now, normally I wouldn't suggest this

797
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:30,424
when showing a clip from the show,

798
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:32,445
but pay close attention to the dialogue,

799
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:33,805
especially towards the end.

800
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:37,207
♪ When you're in a fall ♪

801
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:42,070
♪ If you can't fly ♪

802
00:44:48,471 --> 00:44:51,853
I'd better start rocking or I'll really give him something to cry about.

803
00:44:51,933 --> 00:44:57,276
Shut up, buddy. It's cool. Check it out. Check it out.

804
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:58,596
Here it comes.

805
00:44:59,017 --> 00:45:01,098
Here it comes.

806
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,418
Yes! Yes!

807
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:05,220
Rawr! Yes! Yes! Yes!

808
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,620
Rawr!

809
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,401
Rawr!

810
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,342
Rawr! Yes! Yes!

811
00:45:09,822 --> 00:45:11,103
Rawr!

812
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:12,484
Rawr!

813
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,564
This is pretty cool.

814
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:14,245
Yes! Yes!

815
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:15,906
Yeah! Yeah!

816
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:21,337
What? What's going on?

817
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:22,218
It's true.

818
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:28,584
How come they don't just like play that cool part through the whole song?

819
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:34,590
Well, Beavis, if they didn't have like a part of the song that sucked, then it's like the other part wouldn't be as cool.

820
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,013
Really? You're pretty smart.

821
00:45:37,053 --> 00:45:38,894
You're a tough one, Beavis.

822
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:39,535
Yes. Yes.

823
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,112
So it's a pretty silly example, but I think you get the point I was trying to make.

824
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:53,356
It demonstrates this basic concept of how the juxtaposition of these two contrasting elements,

825
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:58,580
in this case, the soft verse and the hard chorus, can have an emotional impact on the viewers.

826
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,883
And I love this idea that if they didn't have a part of the song that sucked,

827
00:46:03,423 --> 00:46:04,964
then maybe the other part wouldn't be as cool.

828
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:07,726
Now, obviously, none of us want any part of our games to suck,

829
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:11,829
but it just speaks to the fact that you can't necessarily crank it up to 11 and leave it.

830
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:17,650
It's that back and forth between contrastive elements that grabs your attention and holds

831
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:18,150
your attention.

832
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,333
And sometimes you need that slow moment, that calm moment before the storm for your key

833
00:46:23,353 --> 00:46:24,513
moment to really stand out.

834
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:29,776
So to do this, you have to first identify what those story moments are around that target

835
00:46:29,816 --> 00:46:30,056
moment.

836
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:35,159
So the story moments in that example I showed at the very beginning is Shepard is helping

837
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:36,180
Joker into the escape pod.

838
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:42,143
She gets thrown back by an explosion, barely presses that eject button before another blast ... ... ...

839
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:49,393
shoots her right out of the Normandy, the Normandy explodes, and then she floats off

840
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:51,174
into space to die.

841
00:46:51,994 --> 00:46:55,516
So if these are the kind of story beats of your scene, what is the moment that you want

842
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:56,397
to stand out?

843
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:59,639
What is the moment you really want to have that emotional impact on the player?

844
00:47:00,379 --> 00:47:03,100
So in this case, it's Shepard floating away into space to die.

845
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,063
So if that's your key moment, how do you make it stand out?

846
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:11,009
And what you want to do is you want to make the lows lower

847
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:11,809
and the highs higher.

848
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:14,851
Create that strong contrast in the narrative, the audio,

849
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:15,852
and the visuals around it.

850
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:19,915
So in this case, we want to highlight this narrative shift

851
00:47:19,955 --> 00:47:20,915
from alive to dead.

852
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:25,018
Then we do that by first showing this massive explosion,

853
00:47:25,038 --> 00:47:27,360
the biggest explosion you could have,

854
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,582
and then immediately cutting to these tiny, tiny, tiny little

855
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:31,602
VFX in the background.

856
00:47:32,203 --> 00:47:34,164
And you can kind of see how we might map out

857
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:34,904
that polarity shift.

858
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,643
Now, the music completely cuts out as soon as Shepard is outside of the Normandy, and

859
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:44,787
the music doesn't come back until the sad piano at the end, and sad piano will always

860
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:45,368
make you cry.

861
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:52,133
So the sound design in the scene goes from sounds of the world around Shepard to just

862
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:55,455
sounds of Shepard and her suit as she's gasping for air.

863
00:47:57,717 --> 00:48:03,502
In a single shot we go from a close-up to this wide shot, creating this feeling of loss

864
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,903
of separation from your character.

865
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:07,916
And here's that transition.

866
00:48:08,896 --> 00:48:13,339
And then in the final shot, we watch the sun set back behind the planet until the world

867
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,780
is dark.

868
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,423
And this visual clarity mirrors the narrative shift from life to death.

869
00:48:19,223 --> 00:48:21,865
So now that we've kind of gone over this, let's take another look at that scene and

870
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,326
see how all these elements work together.

871
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,551
So I hope I've given you a better understanding

872
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:49,212
of these different shifts in polarity

873
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:51,873
and why contrast and context are important

874
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:53,174
and how we use them as creative tools

875
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:55,655
throughout the development process when creating the story,

876
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:58,396
the content, the cinematics, and the overall experience

877
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:58,836
for the player.

878
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:01,958
So some key takeaways here are identify your story themes

879
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,219
early so you can inform design further down the line.

880
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:06,480
Keep it really simple when communicating these ideas

881
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,461
to your content teams.

882
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:09,562
And remember that context can really

883
00:50:09,582 --> 00:50:12,783
have a significant impact on the meaning of an experience.

884
00:50:13,648 --> 00:50:16,249
If you're interested in learning more about narrative, visual,

885
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:18,831
and audio polarities, I'd highly recommend these books.

886
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:21,032
The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler,

887
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,973
The Visual Story by Bruce Block, and Sound Design

888
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:25,034
by David Sonenshine.

889
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:28,296
So that's the end of my talk.

890
00:50:28,376 --> 00:50:29,677
I hope you have some time for questions.

891
00:50:29,877 --> 00:50:31,237
If I don't get your question today,

892
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:33,679
please feel free to email me or follow me on Twitter.

893
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,520
