00:00:01,263 --> 00:00:03,785
Hi everyone, welcome to the Gamasutra Twitch channel.

2
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:05,466
My name is Bryant Francis.

3
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:07,967
I am the invisible ghost inside your head.

4
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:09,368
Once again, invisible.

5
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:12,289
Last time we were here together, I was not.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,533
You saw me and you saw Liam, the lovely cat who is sometimes going to yell on the stream

7
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:19,813
today.

8
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:24,076
But we are here on the GDC Twitch channel doing what we usually do, which is talking

9
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,417
to game developers about the cool games that they are working on.

10
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:29,980
Today we are playing the Blackout Club.

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:35,185
The Blackout Club comes from the folks at Question who previously released the Magic Circle.

12
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:43,553
And in the lower left hand corner of the screen, I'll give Jordan a little more face time down there.

13
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:46,876
Jordan, we have... yeah, just pulling Jordan over.

14
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,678
Yeah, well then Mike loses out.

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,060
Oh no, I have to pick.

16
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:53,735
Sorry Jordan.

17
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:57,920
It's good, it's a Bioshock style Harvest Save situation.

18
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,402
Ah, it's Harvest Save, it's Bioshock.

19
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:01,425
I guess we'll talk about Bioshock today since you all worked on it.

20
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,127
Anyway, this is Jordan and Michael.

21
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:04,990
Jordan has the red background behind him.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,551
Say hi Jordan.

23
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:06,672
Hello.

24
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,156
And that's Michael, he's got the nice headset on.

25
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:10,137
Hello.

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,661
And they will be taking your questions today.

27
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:17,666
Basically, The Blackout Club is a four-person horror co-op game, which you are seeing.

28
00:01:18,907 --> 00:01:20,608
We are playing the demo level.

29
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:25,612
Feral disclosure, this is pre-recorded footage, so you can't yell at me if I'm messing up.

30
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,954
You can only just reflect on the errors I have made.

31
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:31,658
So we're going to go through the demo level, and then before we're out today,

32
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,579
we will get to see a couple full missions of the game,

33
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,662
because I was able to find some very nice people to play with last night

34
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:39,064
who were very helpful and very kind. You got a nice community.

35
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:42,246
Oh, that's very good to hear.

36
00:01:42,326 --> 00:01:46,068
We're very proud of our discord community, especially right now.

37
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:47,729
Yeah, I admit it wasn't through.

38
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:48,829
I just found them in the lobbies.

39
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,311
Anyway, I guess to be honest, it's probably mostly the same people

40
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:54,052
to get.

41
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,054
I guess I'm looking at this high five machine first.

42
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:01,716
Well, as I awkwardly high five the robot, Jordan and Michael,

43
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:04,398
would you mind explaining the origins of the Blackout Club

44
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,700
and why you went from making a game like the Magic Circle

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,941
to making a four person horror co-op game?

46
00:02:10,853 --> 00:02:12,814
I think we should make Patches explain this.

47
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:15,616
I would love to hear your take on why that probably was.

48
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,977
For the record, Michael is Patches, although I still don't know.

49
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:20,299
Oh, we lost Patches' camera.

50
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,820
Never mind. I'll do that then.

51
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,702
Yeah. So following the Magic Circle, which is an extremely meta game

52
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:31,126
about game development, we had sort of our fill of two things.

53
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,168
One, games that say exactly what they mean.

54
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:37,069
It was fun, but we've done that for a very long time

55
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,471
through several Bioshocks and then the Magic Circle.

56
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,950
And then secondarily, the sort of length problem,

57
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,931
major criticism of the Magic Circle

58
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:45,992
from most people who bought it was,

59
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,153
this game is too short, right?

60
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,214
I paid for this much,

61
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,135
I want a game that goes on for much longer.

62
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:54,298
Okay, the world is changing, Steam is changing.

63
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:57,781
We need something that we personally believe in,

64
00:02:57,881 --> 00:02:59,582
which is the sort of cooperative horror thing,

65
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:00,923
but that dovetails better

66
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:02,304
with the way people play games on Steam.

67
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,225
We're just getting involved with them

68
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:04,966
and sticking with them over a longer period.

69
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:22,155
Yeah. And so I pitched around a couple of different things and the one that stuck was this notion of a suburban horror game where the friendship between these sort of the set of kids was going to be at center stage and that you would be scared but with friends.

70
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:29,522
And we were three people at the time we've doubled in size since we brought on Michael Patches Kelly here, who is now back.

71
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:34,791
and several others, and we began to sort of bolt it together.

72
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:36,652
We're now in early access, as you know,

73
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:40,795
and finally starting to get real feedback from people

74
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,796
on how it feels to play and improving it every day.

75
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:46,178
Right on. Patches, before you quickly dropped out there,

76
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,400
Jordan said he wants to hear your version

77
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,181
of your origin story for Blackout Club.

78
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,983
So I want to hear it, too. What's your take?

79
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:56,064
Yeah, sorry about that.

80
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,006
My internet is wonderful quality.

81
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:04,074
So, let me think about the actual origin of it.

82
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:12,397
When I started working at Question, Jordan had told me that they were working on,

83
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:17,899
you know, we were trying to find a way to do a new horror game that was going to solve

84
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,862
our publishing problem as just a small game dev. You probably did answer. So I kind of caught the

85
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:27,943
tail end of Jordan's answer, so apologies if I overlap. But...

86
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:33,966
You know, you're a small game dev, you're trying to make a game that plays to our strengths, right?

87
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:39,770
Like we worked on AAA games, Stephen and Jordan worked on Bioshock, you know, Kane came from Dishonored.

88
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,553
So the sort of first-person immersive sim genre is something we really like.

89
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:48,036
Obviously, I like working on those games and playing them as well.

90
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:54,020
So we were gonna do that, except for the idea was Jordan wanted to return to horror,

91
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,822
because that's sort of his strength.

92
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,002
for

93
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:58,382
the game.

94
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,880
This actually gets pretty scary. We've had people, you know,

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,283
writing us on Steam community and on forums basically saying, you know, this I couldn't get through the intro and what looks like just walking

96
00:05:34,323 --> 00:05:35,263
around a house at night

97
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:39,044
can still be can still be scary in the right hands and so

98
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:46,267
You know, I felt pretty confident joining question that Jordan had the right hands to make more scary experiences and I wanted to help him with that

99
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:48,128
so

100
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:52,153
That was kind of the origin of what became the Blackout Club.

101
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:57,177
Originally we had, to solve the publishing problem of typically what happens is you're

102
00:05:57,197 --> 00:06:01,941
a small game developer, you make a game, it's, you know, you can only make so many hours

103
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:07,406
of single player content before you run out of money and time, and then what tends to

104
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:12,450
happen is people play it, and then they're done, and that's the end of your sort of community,

105
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,273
that's the end of sort of, you know, attention on the game, as well as...

106
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,368
You know, a lot of people will just put it on Twitch and then they'll just watch somebody play through it.

107
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:25,429
And it's not that we don't want people to enjoy the content, but it's harder to get the sale.

108
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,891
You know, being honest, it's hard to make a living.

109
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:34,712
And so, you know, multiplayer was something we knew could bring people back in.

110
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:42,354
But there's a real problem with horror and multiplayer that probably anybody asked or who plays games like this could tell you, which is.

111
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:48,107
You know, the more friends you add to the scenario, the less scary and usually more absurd it becomes.

112
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:48,567
Yeah.

113
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:53,648
Um, so what worked for us when we were developing the Blackout Club was

114
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:57,449
we can lean into that because they're teenagers.

115
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,431
Um, typically what happens, like, I'm a coward, I'm a scaredy cat.

116
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:05,892
I don't like playing horror games, uh, by myself alone in the dark.

117
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:10,433
And, uh, I do it because it's the best experience, but I always, you know, scare myself.

118
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:17,744
Um, and so I typically like going back to like Resident Evil games and stuff like that back in the day.

119
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,525
I tend to play like over the weekend with a friend on the couch and we'd trade the controller or something.

120
00:07:21,605 --> 00:07:26,907
So that playing a scary game with your friends experience is something we thought like,

121
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,767
okay, here's something we can lean into. It's a little bit of a better...

122
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:35,529
I'm maybe, I'm telling you too much sales information, but this is, you know, the GDC gama sutra.

123
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,229
So I feel like you want to hear this.

124
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,510
We do, we do.

125
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,290
So yeah, we were like, how do we...

126
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:48,679
How do we make this something that you can actually, uh, you know, it's a bigger audience, right?

127
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:53,021
It's a, there's the horror audience, but then there's the friends of the horror audience that you're bringing in.

128
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:58,163
And it's like, well, we'll, you know, I like watching my friend play a scary game, but usually I'm too much of a coward myself.

129
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:05,946
But if we're both playing and we're having some fun in the way that you would with like Left 4 Dead or Vermintide or any other sort of like co-op game, um.

130
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:11,792
Then I've got something to do and you're here with me and so we're brave together.

131
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:12,853
Um, and...

132
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:20,319
Really quick, this tree, this tree scared me so much that we just saw a couple minutes

133
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:20,499
ago.

134
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:21,159
Yeah, that one.

135
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:22,801
Yeah, tell me more.

136
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,683
I'm sorry, Michael, do you have anything else you want to add?

137
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,171
Well, that's, so anyways, long story short, that's kind of how we got there was the idea,

138
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:35,413
like how do we do a multiplayer co-op horror game, and being teenagers in this scenario,

139
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,354
we knew that there's a lot of potential for great horror, because, you know, the genre

140
00:08:38,374 --> 00:08:44,297
tells us that, but, um, Teams vs. Monsters is full of lots of great stuff we love and

141
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,878
wanted to pay tribute to, and we can talk about that later, but, um...

142
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,213
Yeah, anyway, so that was the origin of, from a gameplay standpoint, we were trying to find,

143
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,835
like, let's take that horror experience, but let's find a way to get your friends involved.

144
00:08:57,335 --> 00:09:00,637
And then looking around at other popular multiplayer cooperative games,

145
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:04,919
if we do it as cooperative, we're in this together against the scary thing,

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,062
we felt like that was a good, you know, a good game, a good premise. And we think it'd be

147
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:15,465
something people would want to play, but also you can't spoil it as much if people are streaming it.

148
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:20,209
because the magic is your experience with your friends, right?

149
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:21,169
That's what's fun about it.

150
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,531
And I guess on the streaming end, there's also the argument that like,

151
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,593
if people aren't playing, they're watching other people play.

152
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,814
It's like watching a horror movie.

153
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:30,395
It's like watching people be trapped in a horror movie making dumb decisions,

154
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:33,517
which is what you will see plenty of times in the stream.

155
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,780
Because you get to watch me making terrible decisions in a horror movie.

156
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:49,212
If I can ask both of you about what happened after that first decision, sort of that cognizance that you wanted to make a horror game and you also wanted to make a game that could retain a community.

157
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:58,001
What was the first architectural and design thing you had to do to take that very loose, I'm sure very like...

158
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:05,063
It's not exactly, I mean you could say it's Left 4 Dead, but with kids and then build that out.

159
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,965
But I'm sure it wasn't quite like that when you were building it.

160
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:13,673
How did you go from sort of those fundamental roots of game business and game design to making what we're looking at right now?

161
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,680
It was a combination. The first task was to switch from Unity to Unreal.

162
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:26,316
Unreal has a built-in multiplayer architecture which was a lot more robust and got us up and running much more swiftly.

163
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:31,619
Originally the game pitch was that you would be underground the entire time,

164
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:37,142
trapped alone in the maze beneath the streets. Spoiler alert, there's a maze beneath the streets.

165
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:37,683
We'll see.

166
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:45,147
And you would band together with people but in a sort of more Journey-esque.

167
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,502
a format where your sessions would merge and then part kind of seamlessly.

168
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:57,305
It was interesting, but we transitioned pretty early on to a session-based model

169
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:02,207
where you're able to actually experience the kids' neighborhood in suburbia,

170
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:06,068
and then we weren't bound by the rules of a persistent world

171
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:07,449
like we would be in something like Bioshock.

172
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:08,289
Yeah.

173
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,431
And so changing towards that made us more Left 4 Dead-like.

174
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:16,993
Honestly, to some extent, those earmarks that people learn to look for, like,

175
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,114
I like games like this.

176
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:19,134
We needed a few of them.

177
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:22,215
And we were willing to say, like, OK, yeah, let's let's let's be as familiar

178
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:26,417
as possible from the surface and then surprise them once they're in.

179
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:30,499
And so we developed a sort of.

180
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:34,964
World Bible, it was by now very far out of date.

181
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,006
We developed a series of mission pitches,

182
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:41,767
also super long in the tooth now and not highly relevant,

183
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:45,789
but they got us off the ground and we began to hire.

184
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,010
And so we brought on Patches,

185
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,432
Jason Mojica from the Payday 2 team,

186
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:55,794
Jeff Lake from Dishonored and Prey,

187
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,935
and David Pittman who had done Eldritch

188
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,696
and worked with us on Bioshock 2.

189
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,882
And we're also working with Patrick Waltrip,

190
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:10,086
who did audio for multiple Bioshocks, and many others.

191
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:13,008
And in any case, we're now actually seven.

192
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,072
But long story short, it became a process

193
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:20,394
of trying to make sure the vision made sense

194
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,775
each time a new person came on.

195
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:23,937
The hiring sort of forced us to reframe

196
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,178
what the hell the thing was,

197
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,921
as each time somebody new would come in and say like,

198
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,522
okay, well, what is it you want me to do?

199
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:34,044
And it has been a fast growth process.

200
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,185
It has been challenging.

201
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:36,646
We've also had help.

202
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:38,706
We can't really talk about from where,

203
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:40,147
but suffice it to say,

204
00:12:40,747 --> 00:12:41,908
there are people who believed in us

205
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:43,629
and helped make the Blackout Club happen.

206
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,550
And honestly, it wouldn't have without them.

207
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,332
And so it was a combination of working with them from afar

208
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:50,912
and also building our own team

209
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:53,033
that has, I think, been our primary challenge.

210
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:54,834
The actual game,

211
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:59,607
You know, there are a lot of creative challenges, but suburban horror,

212
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:04,149
the sort of teens versus the truth monster genre is something that everybody's

213
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:06,931
got their favorite from pop culture in their head.

214
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:10,093
We felt like it was something that people would be able to drop into easily so we

215
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:12,874
can be as weird as we want, but you can always fall back on, well,

216
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:16,276
I basically know what I'm doing. That was a long answer to your question.

217
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:19,078
No, that's a good answer. Michael, do you want to add anything?

218
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:22,840
Yeah, you're going to have to repeat the question though, at this point.

219
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,425
I followed Jordan's ride, but I didn't know, I forgot where we started.

220
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,287
You don't know what train station we started at.

221
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:34,974
What was your experience moving this game from idea to execution?

222
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:38,598
So when I first came on the project...

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,601
We, you know, so I came from a production background.

224
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:47,723
I was an EP on the BioGames, uh, and Top Spin and a bunch of other games at 2K.

225
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:49,024
It was my old life.

226
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,544
And then I did mobile games for a while.

227
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:56,767
And so when I came, before I joined Question, and so when I came on, you know, my first

228
00:13:56,907 --> 00:14:00,809
instinct is, okay, we need a roadmap, we need a plan, we need a skeleton.

229
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,691
You know, how, what's, how are we going to allocate our money and time and budget and

230
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:05,311
all that stuff?

231
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,612
So, um.

232
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:23,655
That was the first thing we did and we, I, you know, this was also an opportunity to sort of test, you know, when you're an AP coming out in production land, you know, you are not making any decisions, you're just enforcing other people's decisions.

233
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:36,379
So I had tried early on to try and say like, well, I've always wanted to and believe very strongly that like a small, playable prototype is the best money we could spend, you know, do not, don't worry about it being pretty, just make it fun.

234
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,530
and we called it Ugly But Fun.

235
00:14:39,471 --> 00:14:40,852
And this isn't just my idea.

236
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,213
The team is very...

237
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,076
I would say, Jordan can correct me if I'm wrong,

238
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:46,617
but I'd say a very flat structure.

239
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:48,399
Everybody really does have a say.

240
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,221
We're small enough that it's just not worth it

241
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:52,883
to try to impose much of a hierarchy other than

242
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:54,885
obviously I'm not going to do the art

243
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:56,626
that Steven is good at that.

244
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:57,788
I'm not writing C++.

245
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,543
In general, we sort of hashed out, okay, what would be like a core experience?

246
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:04,984
What are the things we know we have to have?

247
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:07,225
And so, and it takes a while to get up and running.

248
00:15:07,345 --> 00:15:08,926
I mean, you know, we switched over to Unreal.

249
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,487
We weren't in Unity anymore.

250
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,989
All of the code had to be more or less started over from scratch.

251
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,152
Um, and so, you know, it's like, okay, let's make sure, and locomotion takes a

252
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:22,754
long time, you know, even in Unreal, just to get it exactly the way you want.

253
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:25,195
We knew we wanted to do, you know.

254
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,098
This kind of combat where you're getting up close with people.

255
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:32,160
We knew we wanted to have a closed eyes mechanic for the shape.

256
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,442
I think that was a pretty early concept in this game's development

257
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,264
and still stays pretty core to the identity of the game.

258
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:42,767
You know, an enemy that you can only see with your eyes requires,

259
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:45,029
you know, some engine modifications.

260
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:48,031
It's not just, you know, those tricks.

261
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,012
And so we kind of did that.

262
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,413
And then lastly, the recording mechanic, I think was another big one.

263
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:56,891
We worked on it pretty early, which was, you know, you're going to have this phone in your

264
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:57,271
hand.

265
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:01,553
That phone actually shows you, you know, a screen capture of what you're looking at.

266
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,495
You can see it there at the bottom on the left, the record screen capture.

267
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:09,657
And then we had gone through and then iterate, you know, like figure out what's fun about

268
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:09,897
this.

269
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:15,179
So, because the idea is, you know, one thing, but actually making it fun is game development.

270
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,640
So, uh.

271
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,564
That was kind of our first six months, I'd say.

272
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,825
Maybe a little longer was really just prototyping,

273
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:24,206
prototyping, prototyping.

274
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,268
We had a little map, Jordan Grey boxed.

275
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,329
You know, we did a bunch of art tests

276
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,552
and then it was, okay, let's, you know, get, you know,

277
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:40,196
we coming from Unity the last couple years, you know,

278
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,778
the question team had to sort of change the mentality

279
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:44,738
to get back over to Unreal

280
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:45,999
because it's just a different way of working.

281
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:50,047
Just kind of all the nuts and bolts stuff

282
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,688
that you do starting a project was my first six months or so

283
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:54,569
on the project.

284
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:59,190
And then, yeah, once we felt pretty good

285
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,031
about the prototype, you know,

286
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:02,892
we changed a lot of things in the core design

287
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,272
because we were like, oh, this is more fun.

288
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:05,453
That other thing didn't work.

289
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:07,474
What are you talking about?

290
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:08,774
It was perfect. It was perfect.

291
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,514
From the word go.

292
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,835
Yeah. We've never changed our minds.

293
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:15,737
And so we changed our minds a lot.

294
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:16,977
We worked on a bunch of different.

295
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:23,049
but the reason you don't put a lot of high-quality art in yet

296
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,690
and really dive in on even sound design and things

297
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:32,734
first was because you want to be sure that the game is a game that you want to play

298
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:37,456
for a long period of time and so we had some other ideas that we wanted to add later

299
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:43,159
you know the procedural mission stuff didn't come on immediately we had to sort of determine

300
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:44,700
what makes a mission you know what does it mean

301
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:47,254
It's just dumb stuff like what is an objective?

302
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,957
OK, it's like, you know, like you have to kind of deconstruct games

303
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:52,438
and put it all together.

304
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:53,079
So we did that.

305
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,280
We felt pretty good about the prototype.

306
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,224
And then, you know, you you flesh out, OK, what is the minimum viable product?

307
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:01,224
What's an MVP?

308
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:05,467
People call that like a vertical slice or a horizontal slice or some slice.

309
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,770
What are the features we know we want to have?

310
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,112
And then what is the stuff that, you know, adding on top of it will make it better?

311
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:14,728
and you sort of prioritize your work from there.

312
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:17,549
Like, what is the stuff you know you can't not deliver?

313
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,550
I just realized that orb in the middle

314
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,830
freaked me out a lot more this time

315
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,051
watching my own footage than it did the first time I saw it.

316
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:27,292
Anyway, so that's, yeah, that was how we got started.

317
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:27,832
Right on.

318
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,433
MPKNT in chat would like to clarify,

319
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,554
AP stands for Associate Producer, right?

320
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:35,055
That's correct, yeah. Cool.

321
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,474
It could be assistant producer places too, you know, it's not the main producer.

322
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:39,555
Yeah.

323
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:42,216
How does the testing, they would also like to know, how does the testing and

324
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,838
iteration process go for a game like this compared to the single player games

325
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:46,958
you all are more familiar with?

326
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:49,079
It's a lot harder.

327
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,641
You know, we are a small team getting four player multiplayer means,

328
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:56,823
you know, more than 50% of the team needs to be testing at that moment,

329
00:18:58,444 --> 00:18:59,744
which, you know, normally you don't.

330
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,105
Normally it's, you know, you everybody has their own.

331
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:13,318
Like at a large AAA scenario, you'd have a dedicated on-site QA team, you'd have an off-site QA team, you'd have them embedded with a designer or an engineer working together with a clear test plan.

332
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:30,601
We're our own QA for a lot of it. We do have an outsource contractor we use, you know, especially to help just kind of nuts and bolts functional QA or format QA, are terms you've probably heard of, but it's just the, you know, can I clip through the wall? What happens if I jump off the ledge?

333
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:31,402
You know, just normal.

334
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,623
testing. Does this feature do what it says on the 10?

335
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:40,106
So our test process in general is, you know,

336
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:43,687
kind of evolved over time, but in general we all play the game as much as

337
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:47,129
we can all the time. You test a lot in editor before you

338
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,811
check in work, and we have to sort of rely on the

339
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,672
fact that everybody's pretty experienced, you know, this isn't

340
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:58,954
anybody's first game. So we, you know, we do test

341
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:06,317
But I will say, you know, being small, it means that we can't test as much as we need to, to ship the game.

342
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,801
And so we've also done, you know, a lot of internal friends and family testing.

343
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:17,847
And then we did a beta test for pretty much from July through the end of October this year.

344
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,649
And then, you know, in October when we came out.

345
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,812
That's where our Discord community was built,

346
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:27,475
through a series of closed betas that patches ran very well.

347
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,717
And they were just instrumental.

348
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:39,057
It's a lot of people you might have met online are probably coming from that original community,

349
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:39,798
which has been wonderful.

350
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:44,321
The fact that people would have played our game, at this point, dozens and dozens of

351
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:48,504
hours well before it's done is awesome.

352
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:54,849
And that's turned into a lot of our early access community as well to help on-ramp people.

353
00:20:57,051 --> 00:21:00,694
But you know for your listeners tutorials are one of the last things you add in a game

354
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,378
It's the same it goes back to that ugly but fun prototype mentality

355
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,701
You know like don't spend a lot of effort on something you're gonna throw away and rework

356
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,604
Because you know things change, so the last thing you want to put in is here's how it works

357
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:19,950
So as a result our early access is out and it's not everything is tutorial eyes

358
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,472
Do you know this prologue mission you're watching does it?

359
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,331
really good job I would say, but it's not perfect, it doesn't have everything it needs, and

360
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,914
you know, certainly there are a lot of concepts in this game that are,

361
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:36,220
you know, we started with the idea of like a first player, you know, stealth immersive sim type game,

362
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:41,545
but once you add cooperative, once you add a mission-based structure with sessions, once you

363
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:46,529
add multiplayer, plus a lot of other weird ideas we have in this game that kind of make it unique,

364
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,091
you know, there's just a lot to teach.

365
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:52,832
So it's been nice having a community that did play through the beta test because they

366
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:57,554
can kind of help on-ramp new players that we don't necessarily have the bandwidth to

367
00:21:57,574 --> 00:21:57,714
do.

368
00:21:58,554 --> 00:22:04,296
You get to watch some of my struggles right here with the art of not being heard.

369
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:11,558
Jordan while I'm struggling with the dark forces in this, I'm going to ask a question

370
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:11,978
for you.

371
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:18,453
What was your thought process for making this horror cult thing that's going on?

372
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:20,574
And kind of there's also the sense that the parents are in on it.

373
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:27,156
There's sort of some implication that happens here at the end of the stream that like...

374
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:44,860
It's almost like the entire town is engaged in this weird, mysterious stuff you're seeing.

375
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,282
How did that influence making things creepy and scary for players at a granular design level?

376
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:55,104
Oh, let's see. That's a multifaceted one.

377
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,645
I guess I was really interested in building a...

378
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,592
A kind of horror that worked on at least two levels.

379
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,613
A kind of primal level.

380
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:07,796
I think when you're an adolescent, in particular, your mind is being broken

381
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:09,597
and reforging itself in real time.

382
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:14,261
And so you are constantly questioning your reality because it's important for

383
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:18,123
your previous model of reality to blow up in order for you to sort of slowly grow

384
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:18,524
up, right?

385
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:19,044
Yeah.

386
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:19,805
So things like.

387
00:23:20,812 --> 00:23:22,733
What if my family is out to get me?

388
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:24,874
What if my dad is actually evil?

389
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:28,016
Like that kind of stuff floats through the average kid's brain

390
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,596
as they grow older.

391
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:34,439
And so it seemed like a sort of ripe age

392
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,660
to talk about learning that in fact,

393
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,502
you are at the heart of a grand lie of some kind, right?

394
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:44,783
And that your own family could turn against you.

395
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,264
I feel like everybody can understand that

396
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:48,325
on a visceral level, whether or not they understand

397
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:48,865
any of what-

398
00:23:49,675 --> 00:23:51,535
The team mocked me by calling the deep lore.

399
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:55,417
And on the other end of that spectrum,

400
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:58,137
I wanted to build a kind of mythology

401
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:00,198
that didn't resemble anything else.

402
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:03,159
That when you got into the maze under Red Acre,

403
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:05,900
Virginia here in the national radio quiet zone,

404
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,660
where there's no kind of internet signal,

405
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,021
no cellular access,

406
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:13,302
you would see something that could plausibly exist

407
00:24:13,342 --> 00:24:14,082
in the modern world,

408
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:17,863
but made you think of some timeless era.

409
00:24:18,864 --> 00:24:23,688
uh, that you were suddenly dipping, uh, your, uh, your toe into without understanding it.

410
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:28,911
Um, and so, you know, people float around words, words like cult, but I hope that as they play,

411
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:34,055
they, they become kind of versed in something even stranger than that.

412
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:38,938
Um, and, uh, I don't want to go deep into spoilers, but, uh, I, the game states very

413
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:43,141
little of what it means relative to something like the magic circle or Bioshock because we want

414
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:47,064
that part of your brain to constantly be grappling with that, that.

415
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:51,576
fuzzy, unknown edge outside at the edge of consciousness.

416
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:54,819
And it should feel like a nightmare,

417
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:58,582
but a nightmare that operates by a strong inner logic.

418
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:01,785
And we hope that our players slowly puzzle that out.

419
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:29,876
Right on. I think kind of building on that is, um, what was it's the teenager element is interesting to me because the teens are very not good at what most video game characters are good at. Like, they're not good at fighting. They have they can grab and pin which Dr. Thawse in chat says they're a big fan of that mechanic. But they can't, they can't, you know, shoot monsters. This isn't Left 4 Dead shooting zombies. They're, they're sort of they're, they're really good at grappling hooks, which is probably something I wasn't good at when I was a teen.

420
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:36,258
But how did you design individual interactions that you think fit the theme?

421
00:25:36,418 --> 00:25:44,320
That were both thematic and good gameplay, and also wouldn't make Pat just over here look at you in horror when you pitched it to him.

422
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,221
Oh, that's another good question with many answers, and I will try to keep them concise.

423
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:58,183
We had a few creative pillars of the game, and I won't go into all of them, but one of them was that movement was a reward.

424
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:03,217
intrinsically sort of kind of viscerally satisfying.

425
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:08,179
And Kane Shin, our sort of technology lead

426
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,541
who joined us late on the Magic Circle

427
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:14,522
and then sort of saved us, frankly, is big into that.

428
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:16,523
He plays lots of games where movement matters.

429
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,905
And so he kind of made it his personal baby.

430
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:21,266
And I think that he's executed on it beautifully.

431
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:23,827
These kids are way better at parkour than I will ever be.

432
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:26,908
And so with that.

433
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:32,516
established we knew that we could say, okay, well that means that combat is not going to be a thing.

434
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:39,218
Grappling will be a panicky and a pyrrhic victory at best. If you get away from somebody, it's going

435
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:46,560
to hurt unless you use an escape item, in which case that still has a cost. And so we wanted to

436
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,881
focus on the idea that horror is at its best when...

437
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:53,700
vulnerability is maintained.

438
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,222
And so we spoke to an age that seemed reasonably vulnerable

439
00:26:57,302 --> 00:26:59,304
and that allowed us to unask questions about

440
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:01,245
why don't I just fight back?

441
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:04,648
Why don't I just use martial arts and defeat all of these adults

442
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:07,110
one by one like you would in thousands of other games?

443
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:08,611
And so...

444
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:11,893
It was hard to say no to ourselves for a long time.

445
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:15,115
We have made many games where combat was a main feature,

446
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:18,558
but we felt like between the sort of guerrilla tactics,

447
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,580
the kind of clever, outwit your enemies tactics

448
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,441
that began to develop through the other systems

449
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:26,623
the player has access to, and that movement,

450
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:30,065
we could sell to the player the idea

451
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:31,966
that you can either be very stealthy in this game,

452
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,187
because we've built those before,

453
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:36,389
or you can be loud as long as you keep moving.

454
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:40,382
And in no case are you gonna stand in place

455
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:41,823
and defeat all of your enemies.

456
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:44,665
You have to move on, get your mission done,

457
00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,466
take some footage of something forbidden, and then flee.

458
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,910
Speaking to that heart of horror in your hometown.

459
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,332
And all of those, to be perfectly honest,

460
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:02,115
are willing to handshake with the fact

461
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:04,896
that we have strong constraints at a team our size.

462
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,737
It is best for us to control our scope

463
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:07,318
through.

464
00:28:08,337 --> 00:28:13,201
I didn't keep that short but you get the idea.

465
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:18,746
No, I mean, short answers are not a, uh, as someone who asks long questions,

466
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:20,328
I probably earn long answers.

467
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:22,690
If you hear some...

468
00:28:23,884 --> 00:28:26,424
that is not the blackout club that is Liam

469
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:28,965
returning to us and making his presence known

470
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:31,586
he's glaring at me right now because I won't pay attention to him

471
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:33,727
he's on the other side of the room yelling at me

472
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,867
um, uh, Liam's a cat

473
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,828
I want to add animals to the game

474
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:40,909
but that is another thing that we had to say no to ourselves about for a while

475
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:41,569
aww

476
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,849
yeah

477
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,170
I hope cosmetic pets would be good

478
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,071
yeah, right?

479
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:49,152
as long as it doesn't need like a skeletal mesh with rigging and AI

480
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:52,193
yeah, as long as it doesn't need to appear alive

481
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:52,853
if it's a prop

482
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,081
Yeah, no problem.

483
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:58,703
Just a cat that...it's like a cat model that follows you around.

484
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:00,383
Yeah.

485
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,324
Well, let's not get crazy with the following around.

486
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:05,085
It's pathfinding.

487
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:05,765
It's a ghost cat.

488
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:06,765
It clips through everything.

489
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:07,766
He'll G-Man along.

490
00:29:07,966 --> 00:29:14,548
My reaction to your joke proposal for just adding a cat is basically my reaction to everything

491
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:16,669
anybody proposes all the time on this game.

492
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:19,550
Which is usually like, nope, we're a small team.

493
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,590
Nope, we're a small team.

494
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:27,244
It's a good instinct that has gotten us still plenty of features.

495
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:32,151
I will let Liam know that his request for a playable cat has been denied.

496
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:41,062
Back to serious questions, just a quick reminder for folks in chat, you can ask your own questions of our guests so that you can learn more about the making of the Blackout Club.

497
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:44,465
Let's talk about Early Access.

498
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:51,192
What's cool is in a minute here we're going to get to see the multiplayer stuff after I'm done with this bit.

499
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:53,554
Let's talk about Early Access.

500
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,477
How is it going for you all?

501
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:57,978
Early Access is complicated because...

502
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,061
It's pitched as, you know, a chance to test your game before you can make it.

503
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,922
In reality, for some devs, it is their first and only launch.

504
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:08,404
And then if they play it right, they'll get a second launch when they go.

505
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:16,108
What has been your, sort of, your guiding light through Steam's dark waters, I suppose?

506
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:20,070
That metaphor was darker than I intended it to be, but that's the game we're playing, isn't it?

507
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,371
I can take this one.

508
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:26,051
So, you know, I did not do the early...

509
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:28,332
Like, the Magic Circle did come out on Early Access.

510
00:30:28,872 --> 00:30:31,932
I was not on that project, but that was largely, like, a...

511
00:30:32,553 --> 00:30:36,853
You know, used for, hey, the game really is coming out in just an extra week or two.

512
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,734
And I think that was a really good strategy that they did.

513
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:45,635
But this time, you know, it kind of feeds into my earlier point of...

514
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:47,136
The reply about QA.

515
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:49,656
You know, we need...

516
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:51,477
We need people playing the game.

517
00:30:52,537 --> 00:30:54,478
to know a lot of things, you know?

518
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:56,220
Like how is the economy working?

519
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,482
You know, if you've got a weird computer

520
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:00,703
we haven't tested compatibility on yet, you know,

521
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:03,446
we can afford only so much, you know,

522
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:05,728
PC compatibility lab testing time,

523
00:31:05,768 --> 00:31:07,869
where somebody with, you know, 20 different rigs

524
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,451
tries your game and, you know,

525
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:12,753
gives you frame cap and things like that, you know.

526
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,316
There's so much that we just,

527
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,898
being a multiplayer game,

528
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,140
can't test all of it.

529
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,542
And so we knew we had to do a long early access period.

530
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:27,403
Well, we did a long beta test, right?

531
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:28,984
Like, we did beta test.

532
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,165
We told people we were announcing this game

533
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:34,707
at the end of February that it would be out in 2019.

534
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,229
But by summer of 2018, you could already

535
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:41,030
play it in a beta test if you were on a newsletter.

536
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:44,952
And then we slowly let in more rounds of people

537
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,994
after that from both the newsletter sign-up and then

538
00:31:48,632 --> 00:31:50,993
Eventually our discord community. Yeah

539
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:54,695
And you know we had plenty of takers which was you know

540
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,257
We're very fortunate that the idea was strong enough that a lot of people

541
00:31:58,457 --> 00:32:03,600
You know had were hyped enough to want to help test and beta test because I mean a beta is not a finished game

542
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,041
and you know some people

543
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:12,304
It's difficult, right because a game like fortnight is on season four of early access

544
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:13,405
Yeah

545
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,921
You know, it kind of becomes meaningless for larger games that will never leave early access,

546
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:19,482
because why would they? Because they don't need to.

547
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:26,604
And a lot of other games that we really enjoy, I mean I'm not trashing that approach, but

548
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:33,786
we knew that we'd, at the end of the day, still want to hit the date that we set out to do.

549
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:39,287
We still want to come out in 2019. We want to come out, you know, ideally early in 2019.

550
00:32:41,372 --> 00:32:45,514
Early access is our best chance of pulling that off, and it's because we need that QA

551
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:51,077
attention, we need a community to sort of vet a lot of design ideas we're trying that

552
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,058
are certainly novel.

553
00:32:54,139 --> 00:33:00,082
And how the community sort of reacts to a lot of surprises we have in store for them

554
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:06,346
I think is going to inform how ready the game is for full launch, if that makes sense.

555
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:08,147
But mainly it's just, you know...

556
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:12,511
It's the best way to actually do what Early Access was meant to do, which is,

557
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:17,793
hey, if you're excited about this game and you want to help its development and feedback on its development,

558
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:19,633
Early Access is wonderful.

559
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:23,375
You know, my hope is that this will be a positive experience for us.

560
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,196
You know, the first couple weeks have been pretty good.

561
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:29,757
We've got another update hopefully coming out at the end of this week,

562
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:31,978
before the holiday, the Thanksgiving holiday,

563
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,159
for people to enjoy while we're out.

564
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:40,278
We did a week one update, you know, it's certainly a lot of

565
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:47,460
Prioritization of bugs came has already come out of the early access from people who weren't in our beta

566
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,441
But just picked up the game for the first time aren't you know?

567
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:56,183
Dozens of missions in and their first time user experience is very different than the beta testers were

568
00:33:56,863 --> 00:34:02,205
So, you know, I think the pickup and play nature of our game between you know

569
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:06,727
Day one and week one was pretty significant just in that first update

570
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:10,297
and I think it's going to be pretty noticeable again with this week's update.

571
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:12,798
We're trying to react pretty quick to that stuff.

572
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,900
And the hope is, right, that people feel like we're not ditching them.

573
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,441
Because there is that fear on early access.

574
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,682
You come out, you hit early access, you say,

575
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:24,683
here's an incomplete game, we'll totally get to finishing it, and then you don't.

576
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,504
We certainly intend to finish it.

577
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,686
So, that's the...

578
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:32,426
That's...

579
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:35,187
Our hope is that early access are...

580
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:35,908
You know.

581
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:40,499
long-term conversation with the community is not that long-term because there is a,

582
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,382
there is an actual, you know, you can see us trending towards full launch and then we hit full launch.

583
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:50,316
Right on. We're about to hit the multiplayer part, so Jordan, I'll have some questions for you based on my experience here.

584
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:52,617
First, you can watch my character creation.

585
00:34:54,478 --> 00:34:59,941
Quick shoutout, I was actually pretty impressed with this creator because it was a very simple tool that let me be pretty...

586
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:04,783
Like, I could see how different people could express themselves in different ways in this thing in pretty important ways.

587
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:11,546
Like, it's pretty easy to make a character who is gender non-conforming or of different ethnicities pretty easily.

588
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:19,527
Yeah, we're trying to sort of let you define what you want to look like with your eyes rather than with sort of labels.

589
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:24,271
Yeah, although as I tested this for a minute, the dark skin looked really dark.

590
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:31,798
Yeah, it looks like your gamma is also pretty different. I think we need to be a little more aggressive with our gamma tuning.

591
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:33,539
Anyway, we are just looking...

592
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:43,448
Looking in chat, just some quick shoutouts to Snaps the Bunny, Veloxization, and Kane Asylum.

593
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:48,389
Thank you all for joining us. Remember, you can ask some questions of our guests, Michael and

594
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:53,670
Jordan. I assume some of you are actual developers on this game, so I'm sure you can just yell at

595
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,351
them in your own time at whatever questions you have. Sorry, I cannot make this a team meeting

596
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,511
as much as I would like to. It's just eavesdrop on team meetings for this game.

597
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:04,084
Moving on.

598
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:07,226
Snaps and Velocization are two of our kind of star Discord people.

599
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:07,886
Nice.

600
00:36:08,826 --> 00:36:09,107
Welcome.

601
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:12,789
Jordan, I'm going to have some questions about horror design for you in a moment, but I just

602
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:17,051
want to follow up with Mike on one question related to...

603
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:21,053
So it's really, I think a lot of devs are sort of...

604
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:26,376
User acquisition is one of the giant biggest questions that everyone is talking about.

605
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:27,777
So how did you get folks...

606
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:28,697
How did you...

607
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:32,700
What was your method for getting people to sign up for the beta and then early access?

608
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:38,568
We are hashtag blessed in that we have some name recognition.

609
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,309
The question is, it's not our first game.

610
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,431
We already had a newsletter for the Magic Circle.

611
00:36:44,711 --> 00:36:47,813
The company already had followers on social media.

612
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:51,095
I can imagine it is that much harder if you can't say,

613
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,457
hey, former Bioshock developers do X.

614
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:57,799
Clearly all of our old colleagues are doing the same trick.

615
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:00,381
I wish them the best. I think it's the right move to make.

616
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:02,062
Shout out to the molasses flood.

617
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:03,503
Yeah, absolutely.

618
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:09,959
And yeah, I just read a good what I think on their game.

619
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:15,282
Anyway, so it's a user acquisition right now.

620
00:37:15,782 --> 00:37:19,644
When we started was we have a newsletter, we have a social media account.

621
00:37:19,824 --> 00:37:24,026
Some people follow those things, you know, personal accounts also bring in followers.

622
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:31,450
We were lucky in that, you know, again, the credentials of the studio brought people around.

623
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,531
We have a PR agency we work with.

624
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,396
who did outreach as well to press.

625
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:38,816
So the usual stuff, right?

626
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,578
If you've worked on indie games or if you've worked on AAA games,

627
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,659
the technique is still more or less the same, right?

628
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:51,122
A PR agency or you is going to reach out to every outlet you can find

629
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:55,424
and every possible, you know, journalist who might be interested in this.

630
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,124
You know, try not to waste their time.

631
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:57,965
You have a press kit.

632
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:03,316
You say here are screenshots and images and basic information about the game.

633
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:05,157
Here's how you can reach us if you have more questions.

634
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:08,559
Let the world know that we have an announced trailer.

635
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,082
And the announced trailer we worked on for probably almost a month,

636
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:17,325
in between normal work, but there was definitely at least a good work of

637
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:21,728
really this is an important part of getting people to pay attention to us

638
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:23,869
to get that trailer done.

639
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,991
Even Patrick who does our audio.

640
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,688
and also did some audio on Molasses Flood.

641
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:37,234
Did a very cool treatment, I think, if you listen to that teaser trailer announcement that we did.

642
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:44,039
It stands out, not just because of the great art and animation that Steven did,

643
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,545
but also Patrick's work on audio, I think, kind of brings people in.

644
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:51,485
So we had a good trailer.

645
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:56,289
We had some name recognition, and that got us, you know,

646
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:01,911
a 5 digit number of newsletter signups.

647
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:06,595
That was enough, certainly, to populate a beta test and then some.

648
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:07,776
So we had that.

649
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:11,899
We got on Steam as quick as possible so people could wish list us.

650
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:14,241
And then that gives you like a nice, you know, just speaking

651
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,823
from a production standpoint, you get like a nice snowball effect

652
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:20,546
of just over time, more people tell people, you know, they tell two friends.

653
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:23,448
And so you get like a trickle of wish lists coming in

654
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,169
and then just any news announcement.

655
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,470
So, you know, we went to PAX.

656
00:39:27,716 --> 00:39:29,457
To try and get some news and coverage

657
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:32,820
But also the bit I think the bigger benefit for us with Pax

658
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,923
You don't get quite as much news coverage as maybe I thought we would have gotten

659
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:40,025
But you do get a lot of hands-on time with real players

660
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,027
And that was a big deal

661
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,228
We got to hear him scream

662
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:54,036
And they can ask the questions that we don't think of to ask ourselves so, you know, it's a gauntlet it's way too long and

663
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,685
It's like four and a half full days of just like non-stop,

664
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:58,866
Hey, have you heard of the Blackout Club?

665
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:04,068
But you do get a lot of people who have now heard of the Blackout Club and want to ask you about it.

666
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:09,250
And some of them, you know, we had people coming back four days just to play the same demo again.

667
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,992
That's really validating and goes a long way just to team morale,

668
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:17,214
but also helping us hone the pitch and also,

669
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:20,795
you know, people who then got beta keys and joined our beta test

670
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,276
and got a t-shirt and hopefully are wearing it around.

671
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:31,190
You know, just kind of stuff like that that helps us find a little bit of real world validation

672
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:36,533
and also gets the word out and, you know, you can say that you were at these shows

673
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:38,194
and you can point to footage from the event.

674
00:40:38,594 --> 00:40:41,796
You know, we met nice influencers like Jesse Cox who came by

675
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:45,578
and said nice things and talked about us, you know.

676
00:40:45,598 --> 00:40:47,859
So we met a lot of, we made a lot of good contacts.

677
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,441
In terms of user acquisition.

678
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:56,100
At the moment, you know, early access we did basically the same thing we do for announcement, right?

679
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,962
We had a new trailer, we had a new press release, that kind of stuff.

680
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:08,407
I also think that the beta test during that time, you know, key giveaways was a way to get people interested.

681
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:17,333
And, you know, because people are spreading the word and inviting their friends who may also not have paid attention to us yet.

682
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:20,955
And it reminded people that we are a game that even though we're not coming out till next year.

683
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,740
There's already something you can play now.

684
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,981
So even though we weren't in early access yet,

685
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:28,582
people could at least anticipate that we were a real product

686
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:31,364
and not vaporware, which, you know,

687
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:32,624
I've worked on that in the past too.

688
00:41:33,025 --> 00:41:35,906
And it's, at some point you need to finish the game.

689
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,827
So we're doing a very nice show of proof

690
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,428
that no, really there's a game and you can play it.

691
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:44,750
And so, but with early access right now,

692
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,151
I mean, our user acquisition strategy is pretty light.

693
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:54,142
If I'm honest, we want people playing the game during early access, but we do want early access players.

694
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:59,664
And the distinction meaning, in this case, you know, just a step above a beta tester.

695
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:04,685
We really do want people who expect a broken game that's totally not, you know, not done with content

696
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:08,086
and will be iterated on based on feedback from the community.

697
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:12,247
And most players are not that.

698
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:16,828
So we will be ramping up user acquisition later.

699
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,732
when we get closer to full launch to do like the normal,

700
00:42:20,812 --> 00:42:21,793
you know, launch rollout.

701
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,876
And we're pretty critical with ourselves about that issue.

702
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:29,697
Like we QA pretty aggressively internally

703
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:32,519
and we don't want to release something that is unplayable

704
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:35,120
or that won't let you get XP and level up your character

705
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,201
or anything like that, like broken in the sense of

706
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,223
there are imbalanced things you can pull off

707
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:42,384
or you can make an AI look silly, that kind of stuff.

708
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:44,485
But we try very hard to make sure that.

709
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:48,477
At the very least, if you buy the game and play it right now,

710
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,618
you're going to have an interesting experience

711
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:53,600
and an experience that has a loop that completes,

712
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,461
but that you're going to,

713
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:58,042
we welcome your feedback on how to make it better.

714
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,703
And we have reacted to that already with our first update

715
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:02,044
and our upcoming one as well.

716
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:07,046
Yeah, but pretty much the early access feedback

717
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,067
has like really changed the priority

718
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:10,648
of how fast we were going to roll out stuff.

719
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:11,489
Cause it was like, oh wow,

720
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:13,329
this is an issue that people care about immediately.

721
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,150
I'm going to switch over because we are halfway through my successful run.

722
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,751
Oh yeah, this is the great part.

723
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:19,852
I saw the shape and then ran!

724
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:47,296
Yeah, that was, you were asking about, you know, designing for horror in multiplayer.

725
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:51,860
One of the biggest things that we sort of said early on is that there would be almost

726
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,462
no scripted jump scares.

727
00:43:54,062 --> 00:43:58,346
That if there were jump scares, they would be entirely emergent out of systems interacting.

728
00:43:58,406 --> 00:44:02,730
And so the close eyes mechanics where you can see that you're closing your in-game eyes

729
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,214
there for people who haven't played the game before and revealing this boogeyman figure.

730
00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:09,876
The intent was that you would have a jump scare

731
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:11,717
just simply out of what you didn't know, right?

732
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:13,278
And where you physically were positioned

733
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:16,440
and you have to close off this major channel of information

734
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,921
which is the world around you to see this one thing

735
00:44:18,961 --> 00:44:20,682
which is this invisible figure.

736
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:24,084
And we've had a lot of people would yelp like crazy

737
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:27,626
in a way that seems like another scripted game

738
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,908
but in this case, there's no two nights

739
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:30,908
that go exactly alike.

740
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:31,729
Yeah.

741
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,730
And all of that is, well, a lot of that,

742
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,611
not necessarily the shapes,

743
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:44,217
effect specifically, but that notion of dynamism is down to David Pittman working on the procedural

744
00:44:44,237 --> 00:44:48,818
mission system. We're trying very hard to make it feel like a deck of cards where we shuffle

745
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,060
and you play a game with a blackout club and you have dealt an interesting hand and the next night

746
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,201
you'll be dealt a different one. And so if Patches, for example, or Jason implements a new mission,

747
00:44:58,722 --> 00:45:04,645
That's like a new card that we shuffle into the deck and it will just sort of seamlessly make the experience more varied as we keep updating it.

748
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:07,266
Sorry, I'm sure you had a different question, but...

749
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:11,368
Well, I'm glad, honestly, I'm glad you chimed in on that just because that was important to call out.

750
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:18,712
Um, uh, yeah, the, um, my follow-up question would be, um, uh, what is, what makes a good mission?

751
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:22,354
It felt like to me, you're about to see me embark on a second mission and it'll go horribly wrong.

752
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:26,596
Like, we were exploring a similar space, if not the same space, but we were trying to get to a different location.

753
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:32,638
What's sort of the underlying psychology behind like making a good procedural mission in this game?

754
00:45:34,018 --> 00:45:40,980
Oh well, that's something that we are certainly learning in real time. Jason coming on the team

755
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:48,381
has been just miraculous in that front, both in terms of just kind of altering the layout to allow

756
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:55,363
for more multiplayer style movement among players and more inroads to the same space, right, where

757
00:45:55,968 --> 00:46:00,991
If a mission suddenly calls for you to enter from the absolute opposite end of the map,

758
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:05,213
that same space now serves all of those masters.

759
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:11,197
And his advice coming off of Payday 2, I think has helped a lot.

760
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:16,980
The biggest thing that we're noticing is that there is a very fine line between designing

761
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,820
a mission that...

762
00:46:18,749 --> 00:46:22,730
is simple enough to be instantly parsed by a player who's dropped into a session,

763
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,252
they've never played the tutorial, they were invited to play on Steam by a friend,

764
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:31,254
and so they just need to follow the crosshair and do the thing that the game says.

765
00:46:32,575 --> 00:46:35,956
And the other end of the spectrum, which is these very advanced players who want a range of

766
00:46:36,017 --> 00:46:40,078
expression, who don't want to be told exactly what to do, who want to want to poke around in

767
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,519
dark corners and get lost for a while.

768
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:47,087
And we have a certain bandwidth between those extremes

769
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,447
in the blackout club right now,

770
00:46:48,507 --> 00:46:51,388
and constantly kind of trying to find the right balance.

771
00:46:52,188 --> 00:46:54,829
We're even playing with ideas for ways

772
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,870
to handle advanced difficulties,

773
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,850
sort of organically within the experience.

774
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,411
Whether we pull that off, TBD.

775
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:08,093
But the biggest thing has been clear entry

776
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:09,333
and exit conditions.

777
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:11,668
that can easily hand off to one another.

778
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,671
So the way it works right now is there's a category, like steal.

779
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:17,734
And so the kids are there to steal something.

780
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:19,455
And the description of the mission says,

781
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:21,577
okay, we're gonna take something back from the bad guys.

782
00:47:21,677 --> 00:47:24,019
But then the specific thing that you're asked to steal

783
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,421
can be radically different.

784
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,603
In this case it's evidence bags.

785
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:29,204
In this case it's evidence bags.

786
00:47:29,344 --> 00:47:32,047
But when you finish the evidence bags mission,

787
00:47:32,087 --> 00:47:36,591
it might swap to a radically different card in the deck,

788
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:37,612
to extend the metaphor.

789
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:40,288
where suddenly you're asked to steal this bizarre

790
00:47:40,688 --> 00:47:43,370
sort of wooden head that sings every time you move.

791
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,731
So it's kind of like T-Rex vision in Jurassic Park

792
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,933
or something, like every time you move, there's a problem.

793
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:52,176
And so one player has to sort of be that person

794
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:53,677
who does a burst of movement,

795
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,598
stands still while the other person runs around

796
00:47:55,618 --> 00:47:56,439
and runs scout for them.

797
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:57,339
It's like, okay, let's go this way.

798
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,781
There's a lucid, which was one of our bad guys.

799
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:01,322
This direction, so follow me

800
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:02,863
because I can move without making noise.

801
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:04,745
And so.

802
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,933
Coming back to the point of procedural, that objective would just link up under the broader

803
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:13,936
category of steel, and so it sort of feels generally like you're doing something that

804
00:48:13,976 --> 00:48:18,078
has a narrative frame around it, but that there's a certain amount of dynamism as to

805
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:24,342
which objectives you're asked to do that night. And then the kids are told to go home, and that

806
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:29,686
objective is always the same, and exfiltration can often be one of the hardest parts. So it is,

807
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:31,187
at the moment,

808
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:33,353
You tend to be asked to do two things a night.

809
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:37,956
That may extend to three to four kind of shorter things

810
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:39,257
that you might be asked to do in a row,

811
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:40,918
all part of the same category.

812
00:48:40,938 --> 00:48:42,580
And we're actually adding new categories

813
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,622
in the upcoming update as well.

814
00:48:46,142 --> 00:48:48,904
And the hope is that you get to know the Blackout Club

815
00:48:48,964 --> 00:48:51,226
and the kinds of things they might do

816
00:48:51,646 --> 00:48:55,189
through the broader kind of buckets

817
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:56,930
that those categories represent.

818
00:48:57,377 --> 00:49:00,679
But then inside the bucket are, you know, different sort of collections of fun,

819
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:05,341
valuables, and each night you come home with a different one.

820
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:12,364
And right now, our biggest burden is content. We want a lot more mission types, a lot more

821
00:49:13,104 --> 00:49:19,767
scenarios and little enemy behaviors, things like that. And we will slowly let them creep

822
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:23,928
into the build and hopefully take early access players by surprise.

823
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:29,394
Um, Dr. Thaw says Shape Boy is going to be here before we're even in the maze.

824
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:29,694
Rip.

825
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,395
Uh, yeah, this one doesn't go so well.

826
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,777
Um, God, this moment, when that, when that, when this jerk run, jump through

827
00:49:35,797 --> 00:49:37,877
that window, I was very unpleased.

828
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:42,899
Um, uh, I, I haven't, the going through windows stuff was a lot, it was a lot of

829
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:48,641
work, uh, you know, props to Kane, who is I think in that chat right now, uh, for

830
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:52,463
the windows and a lot, just our general mantle movement set.

831
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:54,694
Overall, I think, in a long way.

832
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:25,558
But during all that time, there's a way for your friends to get you back in the game by tagging you and pulling you back to life.

833
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,803
You can see us try that later. It's gonna go badly. This run goes badly.

834
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:36,746
What was the mindset behind that? And even though horror is supposed to be about the threat of death,

835
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:42,250
why was it so essential for you to give players a lot of ways to get back in control before dying?

836
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,672
It's a combination.

837
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:52,577
Because once you have fully failed, there's a certain loss of your time investment.

838
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:57,281
You know, you have to restart and because you might have been asked to do several procedural

839
00:50:57,341 --> 00:51:00,363
objectives in a row, we wanted to make sure that it wasn't too frustrating.

840
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:01,004
And so...

841
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:08,290
That notion of partial failure is a lesson I learned all the way as far back as the Thief series when I was working with Randy Smith and co.

842
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,191
I don't know if you've met him.

843
00:51:09,551 --> 00:51:09,771
Oh yeah.

844
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:11,812
We've, we've interviewed Randy, I think on the stream before.

845
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:17,536
I imagined you might see, I just guessed that because of GDC, et cetera.

846
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:24,760
But, um, uh, you know, he talked a lot about the role of partial failure in games that even claim to support stealth.

847
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:25,061
Right.

848
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:29,443
And even though ours is not, uh, stealth only, um, that idea of, okay.

849
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,702
The game is really fun and really scary when I'm almost screwed,

850
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:37,165
but not entirely screwed. Can I pull it back up before the mountain?

851
00:51:37,205 --> 00:51:39,366
Can I recover this situation?

852
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:44,710
And so there's a lot of otherwise you get poor stealth, right? Where, um,

853
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,971
it's insta fail. Uh, like a lot of,

854
00:51:46,991 --> 00:51:50,073
a lot of action games that try to have the single stealth mission where you're,

855
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,395
you just kind of feel like you've been slapped on the wrist by the hand of God.

856
00:51:54,376 --> 00:51:54,976
And, um,

857
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:55,760
and

858
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:55,820
it

859
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:24,298
Each individual kid is caught too many times, then they are deemed to be too large of a risk, and then it's curtains.

860
00:52:24,678 --> 00:52:26,519
Um, and so I don't know if that happens here.

861
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,480
Which is what is happening here.

862
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,861
That's me, right there, we're watching me.

863
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:33,503
And now we're watching my friends who are, my new friends who are trying to get us out.

864
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:41,546
Right, and there's a, you know, just from a gameplay standpoint, you know, if you think about, like I worked on the Borderlands, uh, the first Borderlands,

865
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:45,908
and like, the rescue mechanic, that last ditch mechanic, you know,

866
00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:48,662
They added a lot to the game when they finally put it in.

867
00:52:48,682 --> 00:52:54,644
Probably the hundreds of hours I spent testing led to an innate assumption about cooperative

868
00:53:10,252 --> 00:53:14,294
If you can't save your friend, you know, it's what they did in Gears of War as well, right?

869
00:53:14,354 --> 00:53:17,096
Like saving your friend is just a big part of the experience.

870
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:21,698
And reviving in general is a good part of like, we're in this together,

871
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:22,718
we're going to get this sorted.

872
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:29,041
And so a lot of really interesting things came about when we said, okay, your friend isn't dead.

873
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:30,542
Your friend is a sleepwalker.

874
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,543
Your friend has now become a dynamic challenge.

875
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:33,483
Yeah.

876
00:53:33,684 --> 00:53:36,045
The game changes, like the whole experience flips.

877
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:38,606
And suddenly, you know.

878
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:43,527
It's not over, and it's also now become a little bit more interesting.

879
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:45,448
Yeah, and on that note...

880
00:53:45,468 --> 00:53:46,448
You have a chance to be a hero.

881
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:49,189
Exactly, exactly. On that note,

882
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:55,231
that this genre that we're sort of trying to build the first major game version of,

883
00:53:56,292 --> 00:54:01,774
the bond between the kids and the sort of vicarious experience of kind of wanting to be one of those kids

884
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:05,575
and having friendships that strong is a big part of the thrill.

885
00:54:06,015 --> 00:54:09,017
It's not just the horror, it's not just the notion of them sort of...

886
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,401
using curse words for the first time at each other.

887
00:54:12,763 --> 00:54:17,507
It's that notion that they're friends to the end,

888
00:54:17,527 --> 00:54:19,008
that they would die for one another.

889
00:54:19,028 --> 00:54:22,571
And that is in the deep DNA of this game.

890
00:54:22,671 --> 00:54:24,593
We really wanted you to feel like

891
00:54:26,085 --> 00:54:30,428
You were part of a group that your friendship is all you have.

892
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:34,571
And one of the things that's kind of funny about the Blackout Club is that we don't strictly

893
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:38,894
enforce it. You can absolutely not just fail an objective, but as long as you've succeeded

894
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:45,158
at one objective, you get some experience. Failure sort of teaches the club. But then

895
00:54:45,438 --> 00:54:52,002
on top of that, there's a bonus for leaving with everybody, everybody not sleepwalking,

896
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:52,683
everybody intact.

897
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:58,422
And it's, but you can, you can go through hundreds of missions and level up your character without doing that.

898
00:54:58,442 --> 00:55:01,947
You can abandon your friends and it can be fine, but nobody does.

899
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:07,694
We've watched so many people play this game on Twitch and so forth, and they always want to go back for each other,

900
00:55:07,774 --> 00:55:10,477
even when they're playing with randos, which we find deeply heartwarming.

901
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,819
And it feels like the themes are working.

902
00:55:13,298 --> 00:55:17,199
Nice, well as we're about to see my run here is about to wrap up.

903
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,900
My recorded footage is about to shut off for the day.

904
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,581
But yeah, Jordan and Mike, I guess Patches, can I call you Patches?

905
00:55:25,841 --> 00:55:26,702
Am I in the Patches club?

906
00:55:27,162 --> 00:55:29,922
Yeah, Jordan and Patches, thank you so much for joining us today.

907
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:32,543
This was a really cool chat and I'm really excited to see where

908
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:34,583
development on the Blackout Club goes going forward.

909
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:37,639
It's our pleasure. Thanks for having us.

910
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:44,061
For the folks at home, if you are watching, if you are interested in more streams, we

911
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:46,581
would love it if you hit the follow button because we're going to be talking to a lot

912
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:51,563
of other great devs for the rest of the year, into 2019, and as we get ready for GDC 2019.

913
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:59,905
Brief disclosure, this will be going up on Gamma Sutra later today. Gamma Sutra and GDC

914
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:02,566
are owned by the same parent organization, which is now Informa.

915
00:56:06,547 --> 00:56:11,128
If you are interested in going to GDC, I would like to recommend you scroll down and click the register button.

916
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:16,810
Right now is the best time to register because these are the lowest prices, blah blah blah.

917
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:21,971
My bosses are not going to like hearing me say blah blah blah about our darn show.

918
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:25,512
But yeah, anyway, this is what we're all about.

919
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:32,554
Talk to game developers, learn more about the art of game development, share that information with the other game developers.

920
00:56:32,854 --> 00:56:37,375
Liz is a noob, you just got here. Don't worry, we're going to archive this and put it on Gamasutra.

921
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:40,236
The VOD will go up on the Twitch channel.

922
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:44,297
We're going to make sure you can watch it and, you know, see what you missed out on.

923
00:56:44,637 --> 00:56:49,059
With that, if they have any questions, where should they ask you guys?

924
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,599
I assume the Discord channel is a good place to go.

925
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:54,520
Yeah, it's easy. Just go to discord.gg.

926
00:56:55,915 --> 00:57:02,077
Slash the blackout Club all one word. We also yeah are on Twitter at the blackout Club

927
00:57:02,257 --> 00:57:03,257
I'm at at null speak

928
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:08,679
We tend we tend to engage with Twitter quite a bit just because we get questions there that don't make it to discord

929
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,021
But if you if you just find the blackout Club on steam

930
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:16,202
We try to be on that on the discussions community hub as well

931
00:57:16,382 --> 00:57:22,844
Although I'm not as good at that as the discord right on with that. Have a good day everyone. Bye. Thanks for having us
