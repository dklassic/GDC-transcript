00:00:00,993 --> 00:00:04,255
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:10,077
My name is Brian Francis, I am a contributing editor at GammaStory.com and I am your community

3
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,638
manager for the Game Developers Conference.

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:18,461
I am sitting here today, unfortunately not playing a game like I usually do.

5
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:22,502
We are unfortunately watching some pre-recorded footage, but the game we are checking out

6
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:24,943
is a little game called Knights and Bikes.

7
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:29,505
Knights and Bikes comes from Foam Sword Games that had a successful Kickstarter a couple

8
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:29,945
years ago.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:38,491
Um, uh, principally, uh, its designers include a one, Rex, uh, I should have really figured this out beforehand, is it Crowl or Crowley?

10
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:40,252
Crowley's good, yeah.

11
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:40,973
Crowley's good?

12
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:41,753
Yeah.

13
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:41,994
Yeah.

14
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:45,976
The Y, not having the Y there, um, made me hesitate.

15
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:48,458
Um, Rex, how you doing? You, you worked on this game, right?

16
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,321
I did, yes. Yeah, I'm very good, thank you. Yeah, it's me here.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,332
Cool, thank you. Hey everyone in Twitch chat, we're happy to have you here. Feel free to

18
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:02,373
drop your questions in Twitch chat for Rex. We are taking them.

19
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:07,475
Knights and Bikes came out a few weeks ago. It is a two-player co-op adventure,

20
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,997
or you can play it single player like I did here, featuring a couple kids on a,

21
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:15,977
I think it's a fictional British island, right? It's not a real one?

22
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,178
That's right, yeah.

23
00:01:17,298 --> 00:01:18,878
Yeah, it's a fictional island going out.

24
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:22,020
It's a game about a kid who's on an adventure that's a little bit Goonies, a little bit,

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,201
um, if I say it's a little bit Stranger Things, it's only because Stranger Things is a million

26
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,862
things that, from the 80s already.

27
00:01:28,342 --> 00:01:31,784
Um, but thankfully, what's interesting is unlike a lot of other 80s themed games, some

28
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:36,846
of which we've checked out here on this channel, it's not evident that it's like that, but

29
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:39,487
it does have that like kinda kid-focused adventure vibe.

30
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:44,829
Um, that kind of appeals to everyone, the kid that's inside everyone, I'd say.

31
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:45,469
Is that fair, Rex?

32
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:58,206
Yeah, I hope so. Yeah. I mean, it was definitely a choice to try and get some of that coming-of-age stuff that you get in films like The Goonies.

33
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:04,590
And I think a lot of the, well, to me, a lot of the best coming-of-age stuff, maybe it's because I was a, you know...

34
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:11,009
similar age at the time was films in the 80s like The Goonies and Stand By Me and things like that.

35
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:16,153
So yeah, that was a big influence like really early on in the project.

36
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:24,700
You know, and we took a decision not to go like, you know, over the top with the 80s references.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,265
You know, I think Stranger Things is cool, but it is quite a sort of...

38
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:39,337
I think it's a cleverly put together package of the greatest hits of the 80s and I don't always think that it's necessarily adding a lot to that.

39
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:47,426
Whereas we wanted to go a bit more, kind of, I don't know, tell our own story whilst being influenced by those kind of films.

40
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:52,493
Right on. I guess we haven't given Knights and Bikes a fair introduction yet.

41
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:58,455
Rex, would you mind explaining where Knights and Bikes came from and what kind of game you were setting out to make,

42
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:02,537
besides just being like an 80s game, which really it sort of isn't.

43
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:10,239
Yeah, so it is an action-adventure about these two girls.

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,202
One girl called Demelza, who is the one currently on her bike with the red hair.

45
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:18,499
And the other girl is called Nessa.

46
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,121
And they are exploring this island, trying to find a legendary lost treasure.

47
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:33,043
And, you know, like with any of these things, you know, that's the big quest.

48
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:37,424
But along the way they're learning a lot about friendship and about, sort of, I don't know,

49
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:40,885
they're like pushing slowly at the edges of like...

50
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:49,509
of their childhood experience. They're starting to get independent.

51
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,430
That's very much what bikes, the bikes of the title, represent for us.

52
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:59,112
When you're a kid and you get your first bike, then you can actually go somewhere without your parents.

53
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:08,774
It's just on that edge of kids that are still young and have a lot of emotions on their sleeve.

54
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,723
you know, just be very expressive and open, but at the same time just trying to play it

55
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:20,647
a little bit cooler and kind of, you know, gain some independence and, you know, just

56
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:21,628
grow up a little bit.

57
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,550
Right on.

58
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,815
Moving on, Rex, is it accurate to say that your title on this product is kind of art

59
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:33,098
director and kind of co-creative director, along with Mew You?

60
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,279
Yeah.

61
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,221
I mean, like you say, I mean...

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,382
You know, it is a tiny team. There's just two of us at Foamsword, which is a company the two of us set up.

63
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:54,165
So there's me doing like art, animation, writing, yeah, all of that kind of stuff.

64
00:04:54,345 --> 00:05:02,107
And then Moo is doing like the tech side and like holding the company together and doing the business and all of that side.

65
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:04,448
So, you know, it keeps us very busy.

66
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,168
But yeah, it's kind of.

67
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:12,576
Fun as well to be able to make a game just sat at your kitchen table like I am now.

68
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:20,260
And even though there's just the two of us, we have a couple of great collaborators as well.

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:30,465
So we have Kenny Young, who was audio, head of audio at Media Molecule for a long time.

70
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:34,587
So that's where both myself and Move met.

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,645
So, you know, we both know Kenny well and he's a great friend and an incredibly great

72
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:43,786
sound designer as well.

73
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:47,589
So we have him on the project, helping us out.

74
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:55,655
And then also the music is composed by a friend called Daniel Pemberton, who's a big shot

75
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,597
film composer these days.

76
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:06,808
He doesn't work so much in games, but he's recently done Spider-Man Enter the Spider-Verse,

77
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:12,371
and he's just done the new Dark Crystal series as well.

78
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:17,694
So he's a very busy guy, but we had a little bit of his time as well.

79
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:31,289
Um, yeah, uh, Rex I guess I'd say like here's a question, when you you and I guess talk about you and Moo real quick in your work,

80
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,930
um, it's one thing to sort of talk about Knights and Bikes being an adventure, but there's also kind of a specific...

81
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,752
there's a specific way this game plays, um, uh, there is kind of a top-down, you know, uh...

82
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:47,153
one's a brawler, one is a brawler, one is melee, if I were describing it sort of can- sort of bra- candidly,

83
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,854
but there's- the way you interact with the world and the environment is not...

84
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:54,095
like you aren't on a dungeon crawling adventure, it does feel like...

85
00:06:55,638 --> 00:06:59,659
You're in this lived place and it's sort of how two kids sort of poke and prod at the world around them.

86
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,561
Um, uh, what was your guiding principle for making gameplay and sort of, there's like,

87
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:10,761
I sometimes I feel like games like this can sort of fall prey to, they have with, between

88
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:16,702
Incredible Animation, um, the game itself, the gameplay itself doesn't have its own identity,

89
00:07:16,762 --> 00:07:19,743
but thankfully you all here have your own identity with this gameplay. Like, what was

90
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,823
kind of your guiding principle for making this thing interactive?

91
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,412
Well, I think, I mean initially, I think it can help to just

92
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:29,652
pick

93
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:36,415
like another game to be inspired by so that you have some kind of basis, you know, like when we

94
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:42,616
worked on LittleBigPlanet back in the day, you know, we knew we wanted to make a sort of 2.5D platformer

95
00:07:43,277 --> 00:07:47,998
and that was very useful because then you could be quite experimental within that framework. So

96
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:49,999
for this game

97
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:56,704
I think the two of us, we had slightly different obsessions.

98
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,766
So for myself, it was Earthbound.

99
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:04,147
It's one of my favorite games of all time.

100
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:16,092
And I just loved the combination of the real world being given a video game twist.

101
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,991
The different abilities that you got always made sense,

102
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:28,354
and the fact that you were fighting bullies and people that had listened to too much jazz music.

103
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:35,997
It was really memorable, and obviously the story, and there was quite a bittersweet element to it.

104
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:40,058
So that was definitely an influence.

105
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:44,780
And then Moo, he loved Secret of Mana.

106
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,710
one of his favourite games,

107
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,971
you know, from a similar era as well.

108
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:55,212
So we knew we wanted to make this kind of top-down,

109
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,853
well, semi-top-down perspective

110
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:01,534
to be able to like run around in the world quite easily.

111
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:06,856
Like early on, we actually tried turn-based battles,

112
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:11,037
but those didn't really quite work so well.

113
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:11,417
I mean...

114
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:16,401
You know, they're two energetic kids running around, like, you know, getting up to trouble.

115
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:20,623
It felt a little bit strange to be just sort of like, you know, sort of sitting there and

116
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:23,023
stroking your chin and pondering your next move.

117
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,205
It didn't really feel like what, you know, the kids in the game would do.

118
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:27,685
Mm-hmm.

119
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:38,029
So I guess, you know, a lot of the gameplay is just thinking, well, how would I react

120
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,691
to that if I was just a mischievous...

121
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:50,056
kids who just wanted to look for treasure and dig up the soil and check what's under

122
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:54,137
each rock and just be really curious about the world.

123
00:09:55,417 --> 00:10:03,678
They don't really have so much of the pressure of what slightly older kids would have.

124
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:11,100
At the moment, in the video, we're actually referencing the fact that Demelza, she does

125
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,640
have some quite.

126
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:19,709
on dark things in her background in that her mother's just fairly recently died and she's

127
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:20,970
kind of processing that.

128
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,292
Right on.

129
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,895
I'm going to reach into my question pile for a minute.

130
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:30,458
In the meantime, chat, I can see some fine folks up there.

131
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:31,839
We'd love to hear your questions.

132
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,743
If you want to hear more from Rex about his art process, about Knights and Bikes design

133
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:40,426
process, or if you just want to know what album he's listening to right now.

134
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:41,427
Ask away.

135
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,348
Uh, Rex, I know that there's something very particular going on with the audio in this game.

136
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:53,729
If you pay close attention, I left a little bit of audio up for folks to hear it.

137
00:10:54,109 --> 00:10:56,890
When the dialogue is happening there's kind of this plink plink plink.

138
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,150
It almost sounds like rain.

139
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,071
It's either rain or it's something falling on wood and it hits every kind of...

140
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,411
String by string it hits every word that's generated.

141
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:10,087
What's driving that? That's a really cool...

142
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,929
Yeah, here it's a drum. It's like a little drum for Beardy Man.

143
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,511
And it's like... Yeah, could you dig into that system?

144
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:20,474
Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know if I can dig into it that much,

145
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:23,115
because, you know, I wasn't quite so involved in that.

146
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:26,697
That would be something to really discuss with Kenny,

147
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,639
but I think we were sort of thinking that...

148
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,482
You know, in a little bit like...

149
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,424
What's his name? Charlie Brown, you know,

150
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:41,369
You'd have like the sometimes when the adults are talking they're just making

151
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,292
like wah wah wah wah wah and you're kind of as a kid you're just like whatever

152
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:48,854
you know I'm not really I'm not really concentrating on what you're saying.

153
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:54,538
And I think it it does create a nice sort of thing of feeling like

154
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,221
you know our two girls they've got their own way of communicating.

155
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:02,184
They often talk with these subtitles that are just popping up very quickly at

156
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:05,046
the bottom of the screen and they're quite in tune with each

157
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:05,366
uh whereas

158
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,995
You know, when they come and talk to an adult, you know, suddenly it's like the sound of, you know, pots and pans falling down the stairs.

159
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:14,337
You know, it's a very alien...

160
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:19,081
A very alien tongue to them, really.

161
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,684
The adults, like, you know, they see the world completely differently.

162
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:25,907
I mean, if the adults had come into this room that we're in now,

163
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:29,591
I don't think they would be imagining a little puppet theatre with some...

164
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,771
with some shrimps talking to each other.

165
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,152
Okay, so that's what's happening here.

166
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,233
I was so wilded out.

167
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:35,714
I went into the stream and I was like,

168
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:36,835
what is happening?

169
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,016
Like, is that the curse?

170
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:42,220
Yeah, I mean, there's definitely,

171
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,502
um, you know, I've had a lot of fun with just,

172
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:50,347
um, you know, with each part of the game,

173
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:54,510
you know, like things are worked on in a very iterative way of just thinking,

174
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,733
Oh, I'm sure we could, we could bring a little bit more out here.

175
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,334
Uh, you know, if I was...

176
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,902
If I was a kid running into a warehouse that just had lots of seafood on the ground,

177
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,363
could we maybe do something with that a little bit more?

178
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:14,005
Rather than just crunching around in some shrimps,

179
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,326
actually bring them to life.

180
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:22,428
Here, Demelza's having a conversation, not with the fishmonger, but with the fish.

181
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,089
And the fish doesn't have a lot to say.

182
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,489
Just trying to...

183
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:36,641
Trying to just create this quite different dialogue between the characters and the world

184
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:40,343
than what the adults would have with that same location.

185
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:45,966
I don't know if it's interesting, but weirdly, I've actually got...

186
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,447
I didn't know you were going to play this bit, because this is like two hours?

187
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,548
Two hours into the game, something like that.

188
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,391
I've actually got... because I do all my design work in sketchbooks.

189
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,351
Yeah.

190
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:00,793
So I've got, I mean, you know, I've got stacks of them.

191
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,213
Yeah.

192
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:02,754
Like this.

193
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,136
And I just thought it might be interesting to just see a page.

194
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:05,917
Yeah, let's see it.

195
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:10,481
So that's the space that you were talking about.

196
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:14,164
I don't know how well you can see that, but, you know, I've...

197
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:15,056
You know what's...

198
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:15,596
You know what's...

199
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,317
...create the map and draw it out...

200
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:17,477
Hold on.

201
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:19,879
So your image froze just before you held it up.

202
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:21,220
Ah!

203
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,901
So you got to see me rather than the sketchbook.

204
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:28,864
Your face is just kind of hanging there and this is quite awful.

205
00:14:30,065 --> 00:14:30,886
Hang on, everyone.

206
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:33,247
I'm going to pause our footage real quick.

207
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:33,668
I'm going to...

208
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,969
Rex, I'm going to redial you for a minute.

209
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,330
This is all going to happen live on stream.

210
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,471
This is the art of live video, everyone.

211
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:40,472
Rex, one...

212
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:41,813
I will call you right back.

213
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,676
Alright everyone, sorry about that, this is what happens.

214
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm in California, Rex is in the UK, getting some Skype.

215
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:55,184
Anyway, we got a few folks out there.

216
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:57,566
How are you all doing today? Feel free to...

217
00:14:58,527 --> 00:14:59,908
Okay, Rex, we got you back?

218
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:01,489
Movement.

219
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,490
Movement.

220
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,332
Alright, let's see the sketchbook.

221
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:08,976
Sorry, I just had to rate what the quality of the call was like.

222
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,337
So I gave it one star.

223
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:21,752
Yes, so this is, I don't know if you can see that, but a page from this area.

224
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:31,677
And I try and sort of map everything out in sketchbooks and gradually, I guess my process

225
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:32,658
is really to...

226
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:40,598
Get everything written down on paper so that you can really externalize it and look at it and think about it.

227
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:45,860
I think tooltools aren't necessarily the best tools for actually thinking.

228
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,941
They're really good for doing and making results,

229
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:56,304
but not necessarily good for planning stuff out and going off at strange tangents.

230
00:15:57,204 --> 00:16:02,046
I try and use my sketchbooks more like a visual journal, really.

231
00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:06,028
Sometimes it's more specific, like this,

232
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,871
we've got the map,

233
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:13,573
and then maybe on the next page is figuring out

234
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:18,737
what abilities, what are the things that the kids can do at this stage of the game,

235
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:21,239
what could they interact with,

236
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,802
and just keep going.

237
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:35,737
Right on. Um, Rex, you did a GDC talk this year, um, uh, the, about the art of Knights and Bikes.

238
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:50,644
Um, you talked about, uh, to make the characters and to make a lot of art for this game, you would start by doing kind of a vector paint, uh, or, um, a vector drawing, and then you would do, um, a repaint with two specific brushes.

239
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:55,887
Um, and then that was kind of like, you would do that, and then there was like, then you showed off there was that, and then there was the final pass.

240
00:16:57,027 --> 00:17:03,729
Would you mind talking about that specific process for giving this game a really specific look?

241
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:10,331
Because it's got a two-dimensional look that is papery, but it's also a three-dimensional look in that you move around the space.

242
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,152
I really appreciated what you said in that talk at the time.

243
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:24,715
Well, I think the thinking behind the art style is really to try and...

244
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:31,587
give the sense that you are slightly seeing the world through the eyes of the kids.

245
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:37,792
And that comes, a lot of that comes from the way that it's, as you say, it's all painted

246
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:45,598
with these two brushes and those brushes are kind of similar to like chalk and pastels.

247
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:51,782
So kind of like the materials that these kids would have to tell their own kind of tales,

248
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,703
you know, if they needed to.

249
00:17:54,105 --> 00:18:01,208
At the end of the game, if they needed to write it all down to tell a friend, then they might make something with similar materials.

250
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:04,930
But at the same time, I don't want it to look...

251
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:11,773
I want it to look like one of those stereotypical grown-up does kids' artwork.

252
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:19,917
Kind of a stick person with a 2D house and that sort of crayon style.

253
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,898
So, I'm trying to give some elegance to it as well.

254
00:18:23,797 --> 00:18:27,999
It needs to be believable. You don't want to feel like you're just running around in like a crayon drawing.

255
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:40,884
So, you know, it's a constant balancing act of trying to stylize things and make them look intriguing and different,

256
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:46,907
but also keeping it very believable as well, so that you really do feel that you are in this.

257
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,890
It's Cornish seaside town and you're exploring it and it's got a certain atmosphere to it,

258
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,352
it's got quite a run-down feel.

259
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:09,079
So, yeah, I mean, a lot of the process is basically taking a screenshot of the game

260
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,363
and then painting onto that screenshot with a new item.

261
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,497
I find it quite useful to use the game as like the canvas, essentially.

262
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:26,362
So that, you know, then you're like matching the style and it, you know, it feels like it all ties together.

263
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:34,208
Yeah, so that's, you know, the majority of the kind of the painting side.

264
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:40,894
Like you said, some of the things, particularly the characters, were designed in vectors first,

265
00:19:40,934 --> 00:19:44,516
just because it's very quick to like move things around and make different choices.

266
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,694
But then they'd be repainted with those brushes.

267
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:52,015
I think the brushes are really useful.

268
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:56,598
Just limiting to just two means that it ties everything together.

269
00:19:56,618 --> 00:20:03,743
If you're going to make an entire universe of all kinds of different environments and different...

270
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:09,334
Yeah, well just very different kind of regions and characters and what have you.

271
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:14,396
It's useful to have some kind of unifying thing that pulls it all together

272
00:20:14,476 --> 00:20:19,557
and it's definitely been that sort of painterly art style that's really helped bring it together.

273
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:26,459
And then, you know, it's obviously not a static painting, you know.

274
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:34,341
It animates, so the animation was a really big thing to figure out with the game.

275
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:46,006
I'm trying to get a feeling of both the energy that kids have, you know, that they've got

276
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:46,826
endless energy.

277
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:49,368
They're just expending it the whole time.

278
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:53,630
They're running around, you know, they never sit still.

279
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,492
You know, they're sitting on a chair, you turn around, you turn back, they're like sitting

280
00:20:57,512 --> 00:21:00,773
with their legs up the back of the chair, and next time you turn around they're sitting

281
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,214
completely differently again, you know, always moving.

282
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,795
So it felt like the...

283
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:13,850
The art needed to be very, you know, have a sort of dynamic quality.

284
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,631
So, I mean, you can see at the moment there's lots of, you know,

285
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:21,553
the little sort of flower beds all blowing around and flags blowing around and things.

286
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:30,056
And they're all pretty much all just hand animated, like by drawing multiple frames.

287
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:34,958
But some of the elements.

288
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:45,780
I tried to get a sort of stop motion feel, where it's drawing attention to the fact that

289
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,461
it's being redrawn each frame.

290
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:54,825
And there's kind of the animation term of line boil, where things are wobbling and vibrating.

291
00:21:55,865 --> 00:22:00,848
I think it's useful to convey that energy of the kids.

292
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:06,937
And it's also useful because it has a sort of painterly look as well,

293
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:09,557
so it kind of brings those concepts together.

294
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:15,099
I was going to say something else about that.

295
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:21,201
I go off on a big old spiel about art.

296
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,061
Um...

297
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:32,205
Yeah, so I mean the characters are a mixture of, um...

298
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:38,797
like rigged animation but then with some hand drawn elements like Demelza's hair you can

299
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:47,479
see there, her little red bunches, those are done in a stop motion line boil style, trying

300
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:53,581
to convey both the fact that she's always moving, she's got lots of energy, the fact

301
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:57,902
that it's a very stormy environment so the wind is always blowing in her hair as well,

302
00:22:58,382 --> 00:22:59,102
but also it's...

303
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:07,640
I like to think that it's also representing the aspect of the game which is that the kids

304
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,540
are like adding to the world with their imagination.

305
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:19,982
So the movement of her hair almost represents the idea of fizzing out of her head.

306
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:23,003
And throughout the game we...

307
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:29,971
use the hand-drawn style to actually draw things onto the landscape as the kids are imagining it.

308
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:39,173
So, you know, there's a bit later on where they see this car crusher in a scrapyard.

309
00:23:41,273 --> 00:23:44,414
And, you know, that's kind of a cool thing for kids to see anyway, but, you know,

310
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:47,595
their imaginations get carried away and they see it as a dragon.

311
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:54,116
So, you know, we use this style where I like draw like a white.

312
00:23:54,703 --> 00:24:01,085
sort of ghostly stop-motion version of what the kids were imagining over the landscape.

313
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:05,287
We haven't seen like too many examples of that in this bit because it's quite

314
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:12,209
relatively early on in the game but yeah it's I think the art

315
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:21,753
gives us lots of ways to like play around and kind of be more creative with the way it looks.

316
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:33,840
Right on, um, uh, speaking, actually, I think those, uh, those white speed boosts are a good example, um, of that, of those white lines coming in over the, over the sort of normal landscape.

317
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:43,829
Um, Rex, this game goes, uh, it does have that, it's a, it's a adventure with two kids on a small island, um, mild spoilers, there is...

318
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:53,459
A supernatural component to it that pops up really early, within the first hour, and you're about to see more of it as we enter this next area.

319
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:58,184
How do you... oh dear, this is when my controller just straight disconnected.

320
00:24:58,545 --> 00:25:01,949
Okay, past me got it working again.

321
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:10,136
What would you say is a defining when you have a game where you have you have a world you have how the kids see

322
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:10,756
the world

323
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:14,880
And you have a supernatural component to it that follows

324
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:19,023
How did you set like like add in that third style?

325
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:24,327
I guess like like this kind of when kids are already using their imagination and imagination lends itself towards the otherworldly

326
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:31,493
How did you then define the style that, and implement a style that could keep the player knows,

327
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:35,116
that's real, that's ghosty, that's kid's imagination?

328
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:43,502
Right, yeah. I mean, I think audio helps massively there, because, you know,

329
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:51,889
if you see some of my kind of, you know, hand-drawn sort of wobbly imagination-type driven things,

330
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:53,950
you know, that...

331
00:25:55,187 --> 00:26:03,131
If there's no audio cue, then everyone knows that it's kind of there, but it's not really there at the same time.

332
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:13,317
Whereas if you suddenly see a knight's gauntlet, which comes to life and starts charging at you...

333
00:26:14,972 --> 00:26:20,335
With the audio that's associated with it, you know that's going to hurt you.

334
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:21,156
That's a bigger deal.

335
00:26:21,376 --> 00:26:22,897
Just kind of an example that just popped up.

336
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,059
Those little pink stripes that just popped up.

337
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:29,361
There was a poof as they vanished, which kind of gave me a clue that something was up when I was playing this.

338
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:33,884
Yeah, those are little court jesters.

339
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:44,105
Yeah, because all through the game, obviously, it's called Knights and Bikes, so bikes is a big element, you're seeing lots of cycling around.

340
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:54,548
But also, the knights of the title refers to this ancient treasure that's hidden somewhere on the island that the kids are trying to find.

341
00:26:55,468 --> 00:27:05,011
And that treasure is protected by a kind of evil curse, which will kind of reanimate things that are not animated.

342
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:16,604
And that's the main video gamey aspect of the game, which you have to deal with enemies

343
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,645
and that creates the drama.

344
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:27,728
On top of the more coming of age story and all the themes about childhood and end of

345
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,688
childhood and all of that stuff.

346
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:32,173
Right on.

347
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:35,154
Um, uh, let's talk about level design.

348
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:39,537
Um, I think this game's interesting in that, um, it's pretty linear.

349
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:44,300
Um, like you're going through area by area and there's kind of a pace and flow to things.

350
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,343
Um, but I noticed there's an exceptionally windy logic to all the spaces you go through.

351
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:52,765
Um, some of it's natural, some of it's natural, like the natural shapes, some of it's just

352
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,106
houses or other objects getting in your way.

353
00:27:55,166 --> 00:28:00,770
What was kind of, um, sometimes I feel like, uh, games like this can fall into a space

354
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,110
where...

355
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:05,533
They do have a great look they do have a fun combat loop, but then

356
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:11,196
Sometimes the player can just sort of be walking from circle to circle where where combat is happening

357
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:17,159
And I noticed that nice and bikes does a lot of work to make sure that the player is constantly using that joystick to like

358
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,962
Weave around the space. What was did you do you have any thoughts about making?

359
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,625
What the world felt like from a movement perspective, especially with the bikes, right?

360
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:27,225
Yeah, I mean it's

361
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:35,850
It's interesting that in our first ever prototype, we actually had a completely 2D game.

362
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,411
And, you know, it looked cool, it looked like a painting, and you were moving around in it.

363
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:53,373
But there was no sense of discovery because, you know, because the camera wasn't moving,

364
00:28:53,853 --> 00:28:58,354
you never had things like being revealed as you moved through the environment.

365
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:03,016
And as soon as we switched to this view that you can see now,

366
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:06,758
where it's lots of 2D things but rowed up in a 3D environment,

367
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,862
it suddenly became much more interesting because as you moved through the world,

368
00:29:12,262 --> 00:29:14,843
you know, things would be revealed, like, you know,

369
00:29:14,863 --> 00:29:18,466
either like being wiped off the screen like you just saw there,

370
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:22,248
or, you know, some lever that you didn't know was there,

371
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:25,030
you know, slowly appears as you move around.

372
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,690
So...

373
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:35,731
The visual style definitely helps spur that on.

374
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:43,437
In terms of level design, I think each is...

375
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:46,879
I mean, up until this point, we haven't really, on the stream,

376
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:49,301
seen what I would call a proper level.

377
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:53,805
We're just going into one now, which is a bit more, like you say,

378
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,866
more linear once you're inside it.

379
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:00,919
We've been looking up until this point at the more sort of like open world.

380
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:19,737
You know, and that part of the game is there to try and give the feeling that the kids are, you know, pushing outside of their local, you know, their kind of sphere of comfort almost.

381
00:30:20,457 --> 00:30:22,760
And they are like diving off into the bushes and...

382
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:28,421
They can cycle wherever they want and there's kind of like a carefreeness but also like a slight

383
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:38,108
well sense of a slightly ominous sense as well because you know they are going slightly into

384
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:43,673
the unknown but when they get to a level like we're just about to get into now which is a

385
00:30:44,153 --> 00:30:51,679
a theme park but a theme park like out of season then the game becomes more

386
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,388
I was really pleased with that visual gag.

387
00:30:53,408 --> 00:31:00,554
I don't know if the rest of the world finds it as funny as I do, but I think I was really

388
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:03,456
amused by the idea of just seeing someone...

389
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,992
with all the skin missing off their face,

390
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:25,873
and thinking that's horrific,

391
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:28,315
and then realizing that it's just a biology book.

392
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:29,936
And, you know, I remember as a kid,

393
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:33,498
there was a, like, a pop-up book that we had in school,

394
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,880
which, like, showed how the body works.

395
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,641
And when you opened the pages, you know,

396
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,083
it would show you, like, here's the human body,

397
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,244
but with their skin removed.

398
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:44,685
And it was just horrific, you know.

399
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:47,527
I mean, I don't think I've ever seen anything

400
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:50,849
as quite as disturbing as that book, so I guess that's it.

401
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:52,307
I've sneaked into the game.

402
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:15,133
You, so what you viewer are seeing is me wandering back the way I came looking for some crisps.

403
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,595
I'm checking the buses and such because I was just told to find some crisps.

404
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:24,478
Instead of paying attention to the very obvious, when we get back up to the top of the map you'll see there's a white line

405
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,001
that would have guided me right towards where I need to go and there I would have found said crisps.

406
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:33,523
But instead I went back and kind of tried to follow park logic of like,

407
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,664
okay where can I get crisps at the edge of a park?

408
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:39,046
So, maybe I'm just dumb.

409
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:41,467
Maybe I'm a dummy.

410
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:43,687
Maybe I'm a big ol' dummy of a game player.

411
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:50,470
But Rex, what are your thoughts about when you're using these familiar but painterly

412
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,332
components to making, helping players understand what they're doing, what they're looking

413
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,552
for, etc. in a game space?

414
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:02,774
Well, I think, yeah, I think it is all about little clues, like you say with that white

415
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,535
line that leads you through.

416
00:33:04,955 --> 00:33:05,755
It's very...

417
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:16,108
It is incredibly tricky, I find, to know how to balance those visual clues and, you know,

418
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:23,091
hit that sweet spot where it guides you but without you really noticing that it's helping

419
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:23,272
you.

420
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:28,955
I think if there's, you know, something that we used to find on LittleBigPlanet was, you

421
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,075
know, we would sometimes...

422
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:38,843
sort of stick in, like, because of the way that in LittleBigPlanet you could just sort of like stick up, put actual like stickers on the environment.

423
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,724
And sometimes we put like big arrow in to help you.

424
00:33:41,844 --> 00:33:49,848
But it really takes you out of the fantasy just having an enormous arrow just pointing where to go.

425
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:55,730
So then we replace that with just certain shapes that maybe like guide your eye in a certain way.

426
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,392
One of my favorite things to do on this game is to just put...

427
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:00,718
If

428
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:02,760
you have any questions, feel free to post them.

429
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:31,195
Rex, we lost you sadly. We were trying to bridge this call between the UK and California.

430
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:35,037
It was difficult. Could you repeat, after the animals run away, could you repeat what you were saying?

431
00:34:36,178 --> 00:34:41,861
Yeah, I mean just that they, you know, an animal is, you know, they're moving.

432
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:45,484
They're just something you want to interact with.

433
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:52,108
Whether you're like a mean kid and you just want to, you know, run up to it and cause it, you know.

434
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,261
some kind of mischief or whether you just want to go and pet it.

435
00:34:56,301 --> 00:35:00,263
You know, it's something that I think players respond to,

436
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,745
and then if that bird flies off in a certain direction,

437
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:05,106
then you're led that way.

438
00:35:05,226 --> 00:35:10,529
So I think, you know, there's lots of little tricks that you can put in

439
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:17,052
that just guide in a very subtle way.

440
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:26,075
Right on. Are there any other tricks you like? I noticed in this level the orange and blue lines that we saw in the map back there show up on the ground.

441
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:33,781
Are there any other particular visual tricks that you think your developers should consider when trying to get players to go the right way?

442
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:38,705
I think, I mean it's interesting just thinking about what sort of space that you're designing.

443
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:44,930
So I mean this is a theme park and obviously if you're running a theme park you want to make sure that you're

444
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:50,836
People are able to move through the theme park, so this was kind of an easier level

445
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:59,158
because you could just use some of the design tricks that an actual theme park designer

446
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,039
would employ.

447
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:07,941
So we have these paths on the ground that you know that if you'll just follow that orange

448
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:13,622
line that will at least take you on a loop, and then there's also a blue line that's going

449
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:14,483
off a different way.

450
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:14,783
So...

451
00:36:16,046 --> 00:36:17,487
Those are kind of useful.

452
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:28,950
I think sometimes things like if a level is more linear in terms of you need to move from, say, left to right,

453
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:34,492
then just the way that the wind is blowing through the level, that can really help.

454
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:39,593
If everything in the world is steering you in one direction, that can...

455
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:43,054
I don't know, it's just you don't feel that you're having the friction of...

456
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,770
of the world pushing against you.

457
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:58,095
I remember a friend who, Peter, who worked on Blaster Burst, he was talking once about

458
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:04,658
how all the staircases, you always felt like you were going the right way because of which

459
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:10,041
side your weapon was on, and if you're kind of going the wrong way then the staircase

460
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:13,382
is obscured by the weapon, and if it's the right way then it isn't.

461
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:17,090
cool stuff like that I really like.

462
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:23,635
Obviously this isn't like a first person game, so you know, you can't use tricks quite like that.

463
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:28,779
But yeah, I mean there's definitely a lot of sort of subtle signposting.

464
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:35,464
And then, you know, like, you know, we have to experiment and through playtesting

465
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:40,568
some of the areas in this particular level.

466
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:48,439
Once you sorted them out, their doors would open and you could continue a loop and revisit earlier spaces.

467
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,062
And actually, that didn't really work so well for players.

468
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:55,804
I kind of liked having a little bit more...

469
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:05,792
It allowed you to explore more and walk back over scenery that you'd already seen,

470
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:09,214
but the problem was that, obviously, once you...

471
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:14,570
If I opened up one of those loops, then a player can just start going around that loop forever

472
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,695
without actually going off in the direction that they're supposed to be going.

473
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:23,545
So, yeah, lots of playtesting and responding to that.

474
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:31,244
It's interesting how even after everything you've described was a very thorough process,

475
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:36,606
these are thorough tools you use to get the player figuring out that they sort of just

476
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,326
need to go forward.

477
00:38:37,346 --> 00:38:42,269
And it's interesting how players will still, like just reflecting on myself here in this

478
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:42,549
level.

479
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:50,694
Um, you're gonna see me backtrack of my own volition because I believe, like, I'm sorta stuck where I am, so I backtrack to see if I'm missing anything else.

480
00:38:51,354 --> 00:38:56,017
But you're right, friction is sort of what tells play, or at least, for me, friction tells me a lot.

481
00:38:56,778 --> 00:39:00,320
Instead of going the right way, it's that line about, I think, Halo.

482
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:03,479
Um, you know you're going in the right direction if there are enemies showing up.

483
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,060
Um, uh...

484
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,120
Uh...

485
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,320
Yeah.

486
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:06,221
Uh...

487
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:08,943
I'm sure they also had complicated tricks related to

488
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:10,985
like your- your friend who worked on The Last of Us, but

489
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:11,745
Um...

490
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:13,286
It's- I guess like...

491
00:39:14,147 --> 00:39:18,951
I- I- I don't have much more to add besides it's interesting that players will still do dumb things, I guess?

492
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:19,111
Mhmm.

493
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:22,934
Which as a designer like how do you and when you're trying to make something it's a little more...

494
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:27,456
There are games that keep the space for dumb things open.

495
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:30,777
If you're talking about more open, systems-driven games, we had Astroneer on.

496
00:39:30,897 --> 00:39:32,578
The Astroneer devs on here a while back.

497
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,018
Games like that are very attuned for that.

498
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:41,341
If you do something dumb, it may be the answer to do something right.

499
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:47,083
But if you're playing Knights and Bikes, if you do something like Backtrack,

500
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:48,103
you're genuinely losing.

501
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:58,148
It's not that a game needs to be played efficiently, but you are in a state where the game is not being played the way you and Moo and everyone else wanted it to be played, right?

502
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:02,409
Like you wanted the players to be constantly engaging, constantly finding the fun stuff you guys made.

503
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:05,310
What's sort of your thoughts about that and how to...

504
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:10,432
Do you have any thoughts about that space for letting players...

505
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:16,754
Either letting players or accounting for when players do the dumb stuff that you're gonna see me do?

506
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:19,795
And you've already seen me done. I play games dumbly.

507
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:24,445
I think, I mean, it's definitely...

508
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:34,768
I would always like a game to allow players to play in it as well as play it.

509
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:40,570
So, for instance, there's various interactions that the two characters and the goose...

510
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,771
We haven't really talked that much about the goose, we've got a goose for him.

511
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:50,040
You guys beat Untitled Goose Game to the punch and they unfortunately ate your lunch on the goose run.

512
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:53,863
Yeah.

513
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:56,605
Yeah, I think it's...

514
00:40:57,886 --> 00:41:06,352
Particularly in a game that can be played co-op, it is good to be able to play with each other.

515
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:11,556
So that you're not just constantly needing new content.

516
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:23,372
And sometimes I get frustrated when I play very beautiful, very dramatic games where

517
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:27,093
you're running down a corridor and the floor is falling away.

518
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,074
It's very dramatic.

519
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:36,938
But as a craftsman, I guess I get very stressed playing that kind of stuff sometimes because

520
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:41,060
I'm just like, I want to look at all the care that's gone into this corridor and it's all

521
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,480
just disintegrating.

522
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,343
So, yeah, that's just me as a player.

523
00:41:47,443 --> 00:41:49,084
But I think...

524
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:52,948
Yeah, I don't know.

525
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,130
Hey, I'll take it. I rambled.

526
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,212
You're allowed to ramble.

527
00:41:59,593 --> 00:42:00,774
Anyway, we are coming up.

528
00:42:00,794 --> 00:42:03,836
We've only got 15 minutes or so left in the hour.

529
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,138
We would love to...

530
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,960
We do genuinely like having yous your questions.

531
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,583
I sound a little desperate, but I genuinely want to hear...

532
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:16,628
We have some great folks who ask great questions to our guests and I miss them.

533
00:42:16,688 --> 00:42:18,270
I want to hear their thoughts.

534
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:19,732
It's Twitch.

535
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,954
Twitch is not just us, it's you.

536
00:42:22,054 --> 00:42:22,675
It's the viewer.

537
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:26,219
That's what I'm told in the emails they send me daily.

538
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,351
Rex, you have a really great part of your GDC talk, which is sitting there in Twitch, which I've linked earlier in Twitch chat.

539
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:43,593
Um, you talk about, uh, how you listen to audio to, to help guide your, your craft and the things you want to make.

540
00:42:44,274 --> 00:42:51,635
Um, people should go watch that talk. There's some really choice audio bits, um, that both just sound like knights and bikes, even though they're not knights and bikes.

541
00:42:51,675 --> 00:42:56,336
And also, they're just great. They're just great, um, weird British things.

542
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:59,157
Um, uh, I'm really sorry. I've like...

543
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:18,169
This is a very abstract question, but what is your thought process for converting the

544
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:21,671
things you're listening to into visual styles?

545
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:26,315
You talk about both recordings and just general cafe noises, two things that you like listening

546
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:26,455
to.

547
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:30,305
I think often it's...

548
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:34,949
I think people will often...

549
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,812
You can think of influences as being visual things often.

550
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:44,657
Especially if you're from an art background like myself.

551
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:48,079
I always come at things visually first.

552
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,402
That will be the focus for me.

553
00:43:53,628 --> 00:44:00,592
I find that it's actually quite useful to use audio as your main influence,

554
00:44:01,753 --> 00:44:04,314
rather than other visuals while you're working.

555
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:09,357
Because looking at other visual styles and other visual work

556
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:17,401
can be quite distracting because you're operating in the same space.

557
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:23,064
I don't know, it just overlaps too much.

558
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:29,383
Whereas audio is really interesting because it sort of augments what you're feeling

559
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:34,186
and pushes you in strange new directions.

560
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:44,050
For me, a lot of making games is not just about the look, but also about the feel,

561
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:47,232
and about the atmosphere, and the tone, and all of these kind of things.

562
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:52,614
And music will just transport you to a completely different world, like magically.

563
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:53,651
straight away.

564
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:57,893
If you just open up your

565
00:44:58,514 --> 00:45:00,455
music library and just hit a track at

566
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:02,336
random, it will just totally change

567
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:04,858
the entire mood you're in and

568
00:45:04,898 --> 00:45:06,219
the environment you're in.

569
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:07,279
So I find,

570
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:10,061
you know, obviously, it's

571
00:45:10,121 --> 00:45:12,282
just great to

572
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:13,964
put yourself in these different

573
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,324
spaces while you're working.

574
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,466
I think because I used to

575
00:45:18,606 --> 00:45:20,528
do a lot of trailer editing and

576
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:25,096
like make all the trailers at Media Molecule back in the day, along with other stuff.

577
00:45:25,396 --> 00:45:29,318
So, it's...

578
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:37,260
Yeah, you can just really take players on a fun journey with audio,

579
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:40,081
as well as, you know, influence yourself.

580
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:46,303
And we don't have footage of it today, but the opening of the game

581
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:49,504
has quite a dramatic opening.

582
00:45:50,845 --> 00:45:56,347
with this wild punk track which Daniel wrote and recorded.

583
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:00,788
And it features one of our friend's kids

584
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:04,808
who's eight years old, just like absolutely,

585
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:06,989
he's like screaming his lungs out.

586
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:12,330
And the idea of that track, it's very punky,

587
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,451
you can hear it on our launch trailer,

588
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,172
was to sort of set an intention of

589
00:46:19,954 --> 00:46:25,076
These are kids with too much energy and anything's possible.

590
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:31,839
We didn't want to have one of those slow openings with just lots of establishing shots.

591
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:36,121
Particularly as it's a two-player game, you want to be right into it straight away.

592
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:43,564
So having this wild punk opening track really set the tone for the rest of the game.

593
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:46,705
Audio is the best.

594
00:46:49,464 --> 00:46:54,666
I always really enjoy working with audio people because

595
00:46:56,307 --> 00:47:01,310
you're trying to achieve the same goal and there's total overlap

596
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,392
between what you're doing but also there isn't any at all.

597
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:12,676
I don't feel... I would never lean over and start tweaking the synthesizers.

598
00:47:14,277 --> 00:47:18,059
Whereas it's quite easy in other areas to...

599
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:21,750
Get a bit carried away yourself.

600
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:36,777
Boss encounters, kind of.

601
00:47:37,377 --> 00:47:38,638
Um, what are your...

602
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:39,279
What are your?

603
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:40,800
Earlier I fought a bulldozer.

604
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:41,681
Um...

605
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:42,541
It uh...

606
00:47:42,622 --> 00:47:43,943
It wasn't on camera, unfortunately.

607
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:44,403
Um...

608
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:47,766
What do you think makes a good boss fight in a game like this?

609
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:50,628
I think boss fights are interesting because they used to be, you know,

610
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:53,010
the high-water mark for the skill you taught the player.

611
00:47:53,511 --> 00:47:56,653
But, Knights and Bikes is only just loosely...

612
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,596
The new tools are like you said, it's more about poking and playing and prodding.

613
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:00,477
Um...

614
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:03,339
What do you think makes boss fights work in a game like Knights and Bikes?

615
00:48:05,504 --> 00:48:12,310
Uh, that's kind of an interesting question because, um, uh, I actually hate boss fights.

616
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,773
No, no, that's, that's okay. I'm pretty ambivalent about it myself.

617
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:24,160
I am not a big fan of them at all. Um, I find what really kills me is if, particularly these days,

618
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:29,045
when games have become more open and more experimental and, um...

619
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:32,589
You're just able to play them in your own style.

620
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:38,693
I hate it when I get a boss battle where I just have to do a very, very specific thing.

621
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:46,058
It's like doing a puzzle where you are being shot with lasers and, you know, everything

622
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,080
else is being chucked at you at the same time.

623
00:48:49,101 --> 00:48:51,763
And I don't particularly enjoy...

624
00:48:54,573 --> 00:48:58,756
That, and I don't really enjoy the just constant failing over and over again.

625
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:01,978
Particularly, you know, if you're really enjoying a game and then suddenly you hit

626
00:49:02,018 --> 00:49:05,861
this massive difficulty spike and you're like, well I'm never going to get past that.

627
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:14,286
Um, you know, we've kind of got the only, uh, really the only, um, medium where

628
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:19,170
people don't get to the end of the experience that they've bought.

629
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,553
Um, which I, you know, I always find frustrating if it happens to me.

630
00:49:24,951 --> 00:49:31,053
So, I mean, our boss fights are, you know, they're there for some drama.

631
00:49:31,794 --> 00:49:37,176
They're there to give you a good moment to like high-five each other afterwards

632
00:49:37,316 --> 00:49:42,958
and sort of congratulate your co-player, if you're playing a two-player.

633
00:49:44,938 --> 00:49:51,481
But, you know, they're not there to just prevent you from progressing.

634
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:52,701
There's some...

635
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:59,976
It's extra drama, but not too taxing, hopefully.

636
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:08,660
I think it'll be a long time before I feel that I want to do a boss fight that matches

637
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:14,203
up to REZ, which is my favourite game ever and has the only boss fights I really love.

638
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:19,160
I should follow up, what about Rez?

639
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,821
We... there... I need to plug more GDC things I guess,

640
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:24,502
but we have a great Rez Postmortem sitting in the GDC vault,

641
00:50:24,883 --> 00:50:28,224
which I guess I'll drop in the chat, but what about Rez makes it really resonate?

642
00:50:28,384 --> 00:50:30,445
Rez-o-nate, for you.

643
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:30,966
Hey!

644
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:34,107
Rez-onate with Rez.

645
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:36,188
Um... so...

646
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:40,570
I think it... you know, it is that perfect fusion of...

647
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:51,583
of all the things that make games great. It's the audio-visual, interactive experience. Everything

648
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:59,446
you're doing just feels so good. But it's so surprising as well, the way that... I don't

649
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:03,467
know, it's just brought a lot of different influences in. It's not like you've gone into

650
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:08,429
a computer and it's all like, you know, techie and that's it. There's the whole of like...

651
00:51:09,729 --> 00:51:11,670
The whole of history is in that computer.

652
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:22,730
Yeah, just seeing the artistic vision of that game is just incredible.

653
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:23,490
Yeah, I love it.

654
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:25,011
I play it just all the time.

655
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:25,972
Right on.

656
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:29,994
As we close out our stream today, I guess we have time to talk about...

657
00:51:31,915 --> 00:51:33,376
Knights and Bikes was launched on Kickstarter.

658
00:51:33,436 --> 00:51:36,698
I know Moo is kind of at the business end of things, but I'd love to share your thoughts

659
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:40,781
about connecting with a player community.

660
00:51:45,204 --> 00:51:48,646
What do you think has been important in getting this game out in the world and connecting

661
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:50,027
with people individually?

662
00:51:50,748 --> 00:51:54,070
And being able to sell this game too, I guess is the next part of the question.

663
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:57,452
What do you think has worked for you as a team in that regard?

664
00:51:59,273 --> 00:52:01,695
Well, Kickstarter has worked really well for us.

665
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:08,200
I think the thing that we have really concentrated on is just making sure that we have really

666
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,041
good and constant communication with our backers.

667
00:52:13,016 --> 00:52:18,960
It doesn't take a huge amount of time each month to just put together an update.

668
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:22,423
We always put an update out on the first of the month.

669
00:52:24,384 --> 00:52:29,968
And that's good for the backers, they can see that the project's moving forward.

670
00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:34,472
Our project has taken a fair bit longer than we initially thought it would.

671
00:52:34,892 --> 00:52:38,655
But just keeping them in the loop and making sure that they all feel like they're on the journey

672
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:40,856
and they're getting to see progress.

673
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:46,676
You know, there's quite a lot of backers that are just like, no, you know, take as long as you want, you know, take longer.

674
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:50,759
We're enjoying seeing the, you know, the how it's all coming together.

675
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:59,484
And from our side, it's really useful because it gives a bit more structure.

676
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:02,766
Like doing a backer update on the

677
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:09,070
first of the month always means that like in the last week of the of the month previously,

678
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:12,810
You're kind of thinking, oh, you know, what can I show?

679
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,652
It's almost like doing like a milestone for a publisher.

680
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:18,913
You know, you're kind of like, well, you know,

681
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:22,555
we've got this big giant system that's all very clever,

682
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:26,718
but it's not an easy thing to show.

683
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:30,040
So you try and sort of get a nice mixture of like,

684
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,221
you know, here's some cool thing that Moo's done.

685
00:53:33,642 --> 00:53:34,182
Here's like,

686
00:53:35,498 --> 00:53:40,362
You know, here's something much smaller, but kind of maybe more characterful,

687
00:53:40,382 --> 00:53:43,385
is like a little gif or something that maybe I've been working on.

688
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:50,951
Here's a photo of like Kenny with like a bike up on a desk with 100 microphones around it,

689
00:53:51,011 --> 00:53:56,255
trying to record the sound of the wheels turning, you know, all of those little details.

690
00:53:56,396 --> 00:54:00,739
I think it's really good to share them and it's kind of fun if you do.

691
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,721
You know, I don't really understand why you wouldn't,

692
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:05,143
if you go to a Kickstarter and...

693
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:08,570
Take a lot of investment from people.

694
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,411
Like, you know, it's just fun to share it with them.

695
00:54:14,112 --> 00:54:20,075
Yeah, so we've always tried to make sure that even though we're a tiny team,

696
00:54:20,115 --> 00:54:27,778
that we are always there and communicating and keeping everyone in the loop.

697
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:31,806
Right on, well as my characters venture into scone grotto,

698
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:34,488
and I bede to learn the art of making a proper scone.

699
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:38,430
I'm going to start wrapping things up for this stream today.

700
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,090
Rex, thank you so much for joining us.

701
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,972
If people have questions about Knights and Bikes, where can they ask them?

702
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:51,656
So they can ask on Twitter, at Foamsword Games,

703
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:57,179
or on our website, knightsandbikes.com.

704
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:02,258
There's a good spot. We've got a Discord as well.

705
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:06,885
You know, we have lots of places you can find out about it.

706
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:13,715
Right on. And like now, just like a person who does not make a scone correctly, I shall venture into the sea.

707
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:18,209
With that, everyone, thank you so much. We would appreciate it.

708
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:21,211
Dear viewers, if you were to click the follow button on this here Twitch channel,

709
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,372
if you like chatting with Rex,

710
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:28,397
you would also like the fact that we interview a lot of other game developers here on the Twitch channel.

711
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:33,501
In fact, in just another hour, we are going to be talking to the fine folks from Gunfire Games.

712
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:34,882
I believe we're talking to John Pearl.

713
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:39,535
I think that's what we're talking to. I hope I got his name right here on the air.

714
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:40,656
I did. Cool.

715
00:55:40,856 --> 00:55:44,319
Okay, we're talking to John Pearl of Gunfire Games about Remnant from the Ashes.

716
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,305
It's a really cool, it's a third-person combat game that's got...

717
00:55:49,827 --> 00:55:55,549
A lot to pay tribute to for Dark Souls, but it's got a lot going for it on its own, setting

718
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:57,370
and combat-wise, that makes it different.

719
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:03,712
So we'll come back in an hour and we'll be talking to Jon, and if you are interested

720
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:06,613
in joining us at GDC next year, if you have a talk to give...

721
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:14,977
The GDC Summits are now taking submissions, so go by our website, gdconf.com, and you

722
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,678
can find out more information about that.

723
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:21,280
If you would like to join, if you're a VR developer working in AR, we have XNerdEC going

724
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,262
on in October, you should also join us in San Francisco for that.

725
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:28,864
And if you're just a person at home who just likes video games and likes learning about

726
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:33,566
how they're getting made, we super appreciate having you here, and we hope to see you next

727
00:56:33,586 --> 00:56:34,366
time we go live.

728
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:34,626
Which...

729
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:41,832
It'll be in the next hour, and then we're going to go live many more times this month with many more great game developers.

730
00:56:41,972 --> 00:56:42,973
Rex, thank you so much!

731
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:45,455
Pleasure! Thank you.

732
00:56:45,796 --> 00:56:47,477
Have a good day, everyone. Bye!
