My name is Simon-Albert Boudreau. I'll be talking about asset flipping.

2
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:10,040
Asset flipping is to game development what sampling is to music.

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:16,107
So the same way a producer will remix old albums into new music,

4
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:20,231
I will transform old assets into new things.

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:27,333
So remixing in games consists in finding something already existing that you somehow find value in.

6
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:33,617
And once you found it, you give it a few tweaks and you extract what you find interesting,

7
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,400
and then you put it in a new context.

8
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,363
And now it has a beautiful new life of its own.

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,506
I'll talk about how I integrated remixing into my work as a solo game dev,

10
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,649
and what are the different principles behind it,

11
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,351
and how it completely changed how I make games.
