00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:09,348
Hi and welcome to the Art of Thunderbolts The Dragon's Trap.

2
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:13,051
Thanks for coming. My name is Ben Fiquet.

3
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,135
I'm the art director of the game and co-founder of Lizard Cube,

4
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:20,860
a studio we started in 2015 with Omar, the developer behind this project.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,203
I was also the only artist on the game,

6
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:27,306
so it's easy to talk about the artistic process behind it.

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,381
As you may know, this is originally a game from 1989, created by Westone and directed by RyÅ«ichi Nishizawa.

8
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,945
Omar and I were Sega kids and we loved that game.

9
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:44,070
So 25 years later, we decided to remaster that lost game

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,094
in HD, both thing and drone, art and animation,

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,837
a rearranged soundtrack made with live musician.

12
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:53,439
And on top of that, you can swap from the original game

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,722
at any time at the press of a button.

14
00:00:57,784 --> 00:00:59,465
For those who might not know what it's about,

15
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:00,446
here's a video.

16
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:08,477
To be continued...

17
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:52,260
If you have more than one ninja at home, you'll become stronger,

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,481
If you have more than one ninja at home, you'll become stronger,

19
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:56,241
Don't rush!

20
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:56,802
Don't rush!

21
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:57,362
Yeah!!

22
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:20,459
So there has been many Wonder Boy games,

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,801
starting from a young caveman on a skateboard

24
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:26,023
to slowly shifting towards a fantasy action

25
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,224
adventure platformer.

26
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:29,646
This was a big license at the time,

27
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,228
giving birth to numerous games on various platforms.

28
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:35,450
But what mattered to us was Wonder Boy 3,

29
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,974
the Dragon's Trap, also known as Monster World 2 in Japan,

30
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:41,495
Dragon's Curse for the PC Engine,

31
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:43,596
and Turma da Monica in Brazil.

32
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:49,462
It's considered one of the best games of the platform and also a personal favorite for us.

33
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,503
So when Omar said to me he wanted to try to do a remake of the game,

34
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:55,663
I almost immediately started to draw.

35
00:02:56,084 --> 00:03:01,525
But how do you start? How do you transform nostalgia into something artistically relevant?

36
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,985
Let's start by talking about inspiration.

37
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:11,687
Quick note about me, I'm a French artist who's been working video games and... sorry.

38
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,472
and animation, comics, for about 12 years,

39
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:16,973
and I've been training fine arts

40
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,234
and to do the animation at Goblin School.

41
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:22,837
I'm not specifically a game artist, to be honest.

42
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:24,698
I don't have the knowledge

43
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,820
of many talented individuals here in GDC,

44
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,203
but I really wanted to reimagine that great game

45
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:34,845
at the best of my abilities.

46
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:37,818
Even if I had to do a lot of interpretation,

47
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:40,799
I really tried to nail the original inspirations

48
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,819
that were projected into the game at the time.

49
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,280
So for a start, Akihito Yama,

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,301
I think he's a major inspiration in 80s Japan.

51
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:53,582
Not only is he definitely one of my favorite artists,

52
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:56,582
but I think the developers were really influenced

53
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,223
by his style at the time.

54
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:00,143
And on top of Dragon Ball,

55
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:03,784
his work on the fantasy genre is absolutely wonderful.

56
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:10,849
European comics, which is a style people outside of Europe might not be used to,

57
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,251
but this is a big part of every French kid's culture.

58
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:20,173
It obviously is a huge influence in my work.

59
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:24,635
The beauty of Hiroshi Yoshida, which I find particularly beautiful.

60
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:30,769
And many others. I'm trying to show a wide range of things I like.

61
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:34,855
All of them have in common to leave a big place for line art and subtle colors.

62
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:39,683
And this is why I believe in a style that has never been properly explored in video games.

63
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:45,579
And at that point, even before starting,

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,441
I knew I wanted to make a beautiful hand-drawn game.

65
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,222
And crafted 2D in video games is beautiful.

66
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:54,384
And in my opinion, it can give so much life

67
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:55,865
to characters and environments.

68
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:59,346
But the amazing thing with 2D is that basically the only

69
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,048
constraint is your imagination.

70
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,649
You get what you see is what you get.

71
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,791
And mainly the thing is we started

72
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,852
with a grand total of two people, Omar, who's

73
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:12,133
been doing the programming, and I.

74
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,916
and we couldn't afford other team members.

75
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,299
So we had to rely on our own strength.

76
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:20,784
And I'm not a 3D or cut-out animation guy,

77
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:24,530
but I can easily draw and animate in traditional animation.

78
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,152
Artistic development. This is something I really like to do,

79
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:35,994
looking to find the right art style for a particular project.

80
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:40,636
In this day and age where there is less and less constraints

81
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:44,978
in terms of visuals, it should definitely not be overstated that you

82
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,499
need a proper amount of artistic development.

83
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,161
I'm not saying the visuals are everything in the game, but good art

84
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:54,121
will help you

85
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,643
not to have your game overlooked and ultimately bring more sales.

86
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:02,846
And first I'd like to praise the beauty of the original game.

87
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:08,429
It might not look like much for many of you, but there are really beautiful choices.

88
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:14,208
that were made with all the constraints of the master system, palette limitation.

89
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,871
The sky, for example, is rarely blue,

90
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:22,874
and this indicates a deliberate taste and work of color theory.

91
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:26,657
The style is simple, but everything is rich and vibrant.

92
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:34,369
So, when I started, I really didn't know what shape the project would take,

93
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:38,872
so the obvious thing to do was to make mock-ups for visualizing what I had in mind.

94
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:41,513
At first, I tried to be very loose,

95
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:46,436
experimenting far from the actual image and design of the original game.

96
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:52,200
I tried flat colors, uneven ground, background actions,

97
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:58,804
but as the project took shape, I tried to get closer and closer to the original.

98
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:06,875
Eventually adding effects, water, color style, but limited to the original shapes.

99
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,417
This was the first image we were really happy with.

100
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,579
An image that will drive the art in the right direction.

101
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,783
I also like to test out in video form and ended up making a test in After Effects

102
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:23,544
just to see if Parallax would work.

103
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,287
Here's another mockup I did following that art direction.

104
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,929
You can see a very early version of the UI.

105
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,851
It's also very important and took many iterations

106
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,894
to get right, but we won't have time during this presentation.

107
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:42,945
At that point I started to implement characters into the background.

108
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,950
One important thing I tried to do was having a sense of unity between characters and background.

109
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:53,755
This is why the lines are equally thick in the background and in the characters.

110
00:07:54,216 --> 00:08:00,141
You want to feel that you created a scenery, not just gameplay assets layered on top of each other.

111
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,012
Here is an evolution of the introduction of the game,

112
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,334
which I started by doing a color test.

113
00:08:10,294 --> 00:08:12,055
And then I did details.

114
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,137
In this image, I wanted to show all the locations you

115
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:16,317
might encounter in the game.

116
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,459
But it could prove quite distracting.

117
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,400
So here's the final image.

118
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,042
And with the final image, I also tested out animation,

119
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,064
because I wanted to have that in the game.

120
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,385
But it was.

121
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:37,466
a bit too much work to have proper animation for cutscenes, so we decided to scrap it out.

122
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:53,054
Characters! It was time to really focus on characters, and the characters were

123
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,695
kind of tough, really, because...

124
00:08:56,524 --> 00:08:59,645
it has been very difficult to pinpoint exactly what they look like.

125
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:03,307
As we've seen, the games are all very different in terms of design,

126
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,869
and even in the same game, things might not be rock solid.

127
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,731
These are the official artworks, for example,

128
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,493
but these are the sprites you see in game that's

129
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:17,914
not even the same colors for the hero of the air.

130
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,716
What would be considered the right choice?

131
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,221
And we met with original creator Nishizawa-san.

132
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,221
And I asked him if they had any concept art

133
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,402
on the characters on paper.

134
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:32,442
He told me that at the time,

135
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,223
they didn't really do those kind of things,

136
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:36,023
mainly because they didn't have the time.

137
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:39,304
They drew every pixel art straight away into the game.

138
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,525
And so the mindset I was in for this project

139
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,026
was to sublime my childhood,

140
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:48,026
to make it look as I saw when I was a kid.

141
00:09:48,106 --> 00:09:50,227
So I decided that the Master System sprites

142
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:50,867
were the right.

143
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:52,622
starting point.

144
00:09:55,825 --> 00:10:00,489
Like with the Mocatta, I started really loose. At the time, we didn't know if we could

145
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:04,853
acquire the official license, and I started to scribble different kind of characters.

146
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:10,598
That's when Wonder Girl emerged. She eventually found her way into the game, as we thought

147
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:12,980
it would be a nice addition to the game.

148
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:16,703
The Nurse and the Shop Owner.

149
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:18,705
Sorry, what?

150
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:25,668
Slowly, the first characters we were really happy with started to appear.

151
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,874
Some were easier to apprehend, and some took many iterations.

152
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:32,896
And on a side note...

153
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,163
I'd like to say that a good concept art doesn't necessarily require tons of drawings.

154
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:43,926
You often see art directors priding themselves in having millions of drawings before deciding

155
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,367
on a specific one.

156
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:48,049
But I'd like to say this is not mandatory.

157
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,912
If something good comes at you right away, be smart and seize it.

158
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:56,254
If you're absolutely convinced it's good, I don't know, go for it.

159
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,896
It can save frustration, time, and eventually money.

160
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:07,098
I also had to respect the boundaries of the original sprite for collision,

161
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,263
but as you can see, this is when I started to take some liberties.

162
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:23,196
One of the good things with doing a remake is that you already have the full scope of assets you need.

163
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,997
In this case, which kind and how many enemies I had to draw.

164
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:32,999
You can say the same about all the locations and even the length of the animations.

165
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,263
I only have two advice for character design. The shapes with...

166
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:46,799
The variety of the shapes gives a rhythm to your drawings.

167
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,260
You might want to have a big head and small feet,

168
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,801
so a large body and big hands.

169
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,862
This is important for adding character,

170
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:56,903
and having a good silhouette is also very important.

171
00:11:58,804 --> 00:11:59,584
And contrast.

172
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,805
On top of the rhythm you give with the shapes,

173
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,587
it can also be a huge boost if you vary colors

174
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,207
and contrast inside a character.

175
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:16,208
So animation, this is something I really like.

176
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,452
Actually very important for me as part of video games.

177
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:24,416
A good art direction in my mind should have in mind

178
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:25,678
how the characters will move.

179
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,941
It can convey more emotions or impact

180
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,363
if you place some attention on it.

181
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,241
And this is my personal references.

182
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,963
I grew up in the 90s, and there was

183
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:40,924
a wave of beautifully animated games

184
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:45,767
initiated by Daft Perry using the technique they call Digicel.

185
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:49,529
These were the games I loved, and it feels to me

186
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,010
they were so alive.

187
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:55,032
Like this one, I mean, it's beautiful.

188
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:05,754
So, the pros and cons of traditional animation, it obviously is beautiful, it's easy to start,

189
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:12,821
I think, that's what I think, you just have to draw a succession of drawings instead of

190
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:16,123
a huge setup of rig, texturing, etc.

191
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:23,210
But you won't have a lot of room for iteration, since you would have to redraw your frames

192
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,611
every time you make a change.

193
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:28,364
and you need a capable team of artists.

194
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:32,646
And sometimes it can be tricky to have.

195
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,508
You can change the character's appearance during the game

196
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,409
because you would, again, have to redraw all the frames.

197
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,691
And the texture management can be tricky.

198
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:48,355
So these are the first test I did for the animations.

199
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,121
is crucial to plan things in advance,

200
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,282
especially with solution and mission.

201
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:02,043
And before really starting to make the game,

202
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:06,825
I started experimenting with different design and software.

203
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,927
The first vision was mainly to try animating in Flash,

204
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,707
which doesn't quite work for me.

205
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,088
I've been struggling with Flash my whole life.

206
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:20,849
And the second one was here to refine the technique.

207
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:25,300
and also to pass on to Omar to try to implement it in the prototype.

208
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:30,963
I wasn't quite happy with the design, and the animation felt a bit dull,

209
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:37,928
so finally the third version, more bouncy, better design, the technique is almost there.

210
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:45,533
Another set of animation tests, you can see for example that the lion's sword

211
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,883
was not easily readable at first glance.

212
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,566
I decided then to convey its use for gameplay, which

213
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:55,889
is one heavy weapon able to crush above and below him.

214
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:59,431
So heavy, in fact, that he has to drag it behind him.

215
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,033
And the thing is, I love we kept it.

216
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:04,455
But sometimes, as far as collisions are involved,

217
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,097
you can see the sword overlapping the background

218
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,339
with no real sense at all.

219
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:16,148
This animation is Wonder Boy at the beginning of the game.

220
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:17,428
This is what I wanted to do.

221
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,428
Because at the beginning of the game,

222
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:24,809
you're supposed to be at the end of the second game, Wonder Boy 2.

223
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,450
And you're all powerful.

224
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,350
You have the legendary gear.

225
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,031
And I wanted him to move a bit cocky and show off himself.

226
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:37,112
Eventually, we scrapped that because, again, too much work.

227
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:44,105
And at some point I wanted to try to have town portals,

228
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:47,408
but instead of a magic door, I thought

229
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,931
it would be funnier to have that dragon mouse

230
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,752
holding you and beating you back in town.

231
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,341
Now everything this animation are doing is just improving the look and feel of your movement.

232
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:07,343
We didn't change the physics behind it because you can still play the original game,

233
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:17,268
but even then just adding scratch and stretch, anticipation or pacing can give a whole different appreciation for controlling your character on screen.

234
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:25,632
And in my opinion, even if the control stays a bit stiff, you now have a better sense of your character and the enemies.

235
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:36,555
So here's a process video. As you can see, I started by taking references from the original animation frames.

236
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,077
Thanks to the community for that, because I grabbed it from the internet.

237
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:46,939
And first, the rough animation. You can see the sword swing is a bit different than in-game.

238
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:49,079
I'll explain later why.

239
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,801
And then after that you have the cleanup part, where you have to retrace everything you did.

240
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:03,137
And finally, color.

241
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:08,481
And on top of the colors, I like to add a dark gradient,

242
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,584
which helps anchoring the character to the ground.

243
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:19,670
Here's an example of constraint I had to deal with.

244
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,232
You can see the sword swing of the original,

245
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:23,693
which was quite linear.

246
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,744
I wanted to add more of an impact,

247
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:30,286
and it's implied to have a longer pause at the beginning

248
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,047
and a swift slash of the sword,

249
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:35,949
but we decided to follow the collision of the original game.

250
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:37,869
You can see the collision here in green.

251
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,371
And it was animated at 30 FPS.

252
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:46,313
That's why you can see the sword is a little bit late

253
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,194
at the beginning compared to the collision,

254
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,935
but catches up afterward.

255
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:56,407
It's not really perceptible, but it eventually drives the work in certain ways.

256
00:17:56,427 --> 00:18:10,814
Here's the way I cheated with 2D animation. I added a turn animation,

257
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:14,777
particularly for smoothing the transition when switching direction.

258
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:19,319
But how to have a right-handed character suddenly become left-handed?

259
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:24,756
The original game did an amazing thing by having another sprite when you turned,

260
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:28,442
so your character would always have his word in his right hand,

261
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:32,569
but they add a total of 7 frames of animation per character.

262
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,610
and I have 10 times more, so

263
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:38,632
even if I really wanted to have that feature,

264
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:41,594
it was simply an absurd amount of work.

265
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:42,994
So here's a trick.

266
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:46,917
I drew the animation as to the shield and the sword

267
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,379
flow a smooth curve and end up in the same place

268
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,520
when facing the opposite direction.

269
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,841
And with the magic of animation,

270
00:18:55,181 --> 00:18:57,282
you don't see nothing in real time.

271
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:08,646
Backgrounds, another challenge because due to the technical limitation of the master system,

272
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:15,508
the original game could feel quite empty in some areas, so I had a lot of interpretation to do.

273
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:22,490
Here's the mummy room, for example. There's basically nothing because technically,

274
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:29,891
the master system was considering the boss as the background, so they couldn't have anything else.

275
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,110
And here's what I've done with the place,

276
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:35,671
overlooking the changing graphics.

277
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,753
In these kind of areas, I added visual storytelling

278
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:42,094
by placing various elements in the background.

279
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:45,615
Here's another example.

280
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:48,597
The forest outside the village was just trees

281
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:50,877
next to each other, repeating for two levels.

282
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:54,179
And I experimented very different things

283
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:55,959
before having something interesting.

284
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,221
And the main thing that was missing

285
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,681
was the gameplay readability,

286
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,041
because...

287
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:09,289
In this level, you have a little cloud throwing you fireballs and it was not really obvious.

288
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,394
So I stripped down the most I could and gave space for the cloud, but doing so, that same

289
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:17,275
background was becoming quite empty.

290
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,118
So I added that statue.

291
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,280
It doesn't particularly make sense.

292
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,763
Some players have been asking what it represents.

293
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:31,190
Even if I know it's mainly for filling a void,

294
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,451
it is also a world-building item.

295
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,693
It might be the statue of a lost hero,

296
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,574
a place where heroes die, who knows?

297
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,735
It gives you something to look at and wonder,

298
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,096
instead of, you know, void.

299
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:47,678
And here's the game.

300
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:51,320
You can see I added a lot of parallax to give perspective.

301
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,581
It's always eye candy.

302
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:57,936
And on the statue, please note that we added a slight 3D

303
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:58,556
deformation.

304
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:01,317
It's not really obvious.

305
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:05,458
And we used it for pillars and big sprites.

306
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:07,579
But it feels more natural that way.

307
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,821
Eventually, I tried to spark interest in every screen,

308
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:17,162
adding details and a bit of narrative.

309
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,693
And here you're going to see three different levels of the desert area.

310
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:29,477
In each of them I try to have something changing.

311
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:35,042
You start at the base of the pyramids and then pass in front of the old temple.

312
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:41,428
And finally end up in sort of an oasis, always mainly the same assets but

313
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,790
rearranged to feel you change scenery.

314
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:48,913
And here you go.

315
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:51,275
When you have every asset separated,

316
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:52,495
you start to implement it.

317
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,779
Omar managed to create a splendid engine where I could

318
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,542
put everything I needed, all of it running in real time

319
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,243
on top of the original game, allowing

320
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:04,985
me to know exactly where to put my new assets

321
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:06,626
and eventually making something pretty.

322
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:10,309
And if you feel like a tinkerer, you

323
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:12,711
can access that tool in the Steam version of the game.

324
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:15,473
Just have to edit.

325
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:17,495
You can find the explanation on the website.

326
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,960
And here we are.

327
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,182
I feel incredibly grateful being here,

328
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:32,924
presenting what started as kind of a fun project.

329
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:36,607
Not only we got to work on the Dear Childhood Memory,

330
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,029
but we managed to do it the way we wanted it.

331
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,631
And it resonated with players.

332
00:22:42,512 --> 00:22:46,134
I'd like to thank, obviously, Ryuichi Nishizawa and his team

333
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,336
for making that wonderful game.

334
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,041
Not only is he a really nice guy,

335
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:55,243
but he has been only but supportive of our work

336
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:56,243
from the beginning.

337
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:00,145
And of course, all the projects behind it,

338
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:03,307
Omar, whose love and passion were

339
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:06,909
the true engine of the project, and the team at LaserCube,

340
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:10,251
and our publisher, Dotemu, who first believed in us.

341
00:23:15,238 --> 00:23:17,599
Side note, I'd like to show you a bonus

342
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,200
that I've been playing with.

343
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,880
Some of you might remember the game,

344
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:25,781
which is called Kid Chameleon.

345
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:28,722
And this is what I've done with it.

346
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,863
It could be awesome, but it's not a real project,

347
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:37,884
because really, I don't have the time for it at the moment.

348
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:40,865
But anyway, it could be cool.

349
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:43,885
Thank you very much.

350
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:52,469
We might have time for a few questions.

351
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:02,114
I'm a huge fan of the game. I played through it all.

352
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,395
It's fantastic.

353
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:06,296
I fell in love with it when I saw the original...

354
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:10,258
like, the initial promotional art.

355
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:13,280
I'm curious, what's next for...

356
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:17,162
What's next for Lizard Cube and what's next for Wonder Boy?

357
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:19,483
Are you guys going to do a new version of anything or...

358
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:22,207
Actually, I can't talk about it.

359
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:24,389
It's not Kit Kamien, obviously,

360
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,456
but it's a big project and I'm very happy to be part of it.

361
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,560
But it's going to be traditional animation. No worries.

362
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:34,002
Awesome. Thanks.

363
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,610
Hi, thank you for the presentation.

364
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,231
Amazing art all the way.

365
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:43,512
So my question is for the large object that you were

366
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:48,154
describing on the background that had a 3D effect, was that

367
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:51,535
a normal map thingy, or is that like 3D model?

368
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:56,428
No, it's actually just a simple cylinder

369
00:24:56,448 --> 00:25:01,432
that Omar added the option.

370
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:04,434
When I wanted a sprite to behave like a 3D object,

371
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:08,398
it's just behaving like a cylinder based on the camera.

372
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:11,820
So there's no normal map, no modeling.

373
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,863
If you look closely, it's not very...

374
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:16,664
very well made.

375
00:25:18,264 --> 00:25:19,645
But it does a trick.

376
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:22,245
And if you look at the pillars, it works better

377
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:23,726
because it's very cylinder.

378
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:25,486
OK, awesome.

379
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:25,826
Thank you.

380
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:26,567
You're welcome.

381
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,108
Here we go, another question.

382
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,348
Thank you very much.
