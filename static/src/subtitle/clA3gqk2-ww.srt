1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,641
Hello, can you hear me?

2
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:13,663
Welcome to the State and Future of Board Games 2018 edition.

3
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:16,404
Oh wow, thank you.

4
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,685
Bit of housekeeping, I will get in trouble with the CAs

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,266
if I do not ask you to please fill in your surveys

6
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:23,046
at the end of the session.

7
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,607
We incorporate the feedback that we get from those surveys.

8
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:27,888
Tell us what you think, what you liked,

9
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:28,848
what you'd like to see more of.

10
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:31,469
Feedback like that has been incorporated

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:32,869
from last year into this year,

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,370
and will be again into next year.

13
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,410
It's like the circle of life.

14
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:41,516
from the Lion King, and I can be here in a year's time holding up a cub for you, if that

15
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:42,557
is what you request.

16
00:00:44,298 --> 00:00:48,439
Please do not, please put your phones on silent or make them extremely quiet.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,962
And we'll have a general sort of, oh, thanks, panelists, also you.

18
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:00,865
We'll go through a series of topics ourselves together, and then we'll open up to some questions

19
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,005
sort of halfway through the session.

20
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:07,500
and close off about five minutes from the end for a short thing that I also want to say.

21
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:12,685
Thank you all for coming at 5.30 in what I guess is now the evening.

22
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:16,628
My name is Paul Dean. I am one of the co-founders of Shut Up and Sit Down.

23
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:22,812
I hope by now on the way here you have all seen our large, very green this year, gaming area,

24
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,975
which is full of picnic tables. You can sit down and play a bunch of board games

25
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:28,637
that we think have been particularly exciting over the last year.

26
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:29,558
It's a lovely place.

27
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:35,100
to relax, do something non-digital, and also maybe accidentally network and discover that

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,660
you are sat next to the audio designer from Bungie or something like that.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,061
It is an absolutely wonderful space.

30
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:44,401
I assume you all also know you're here because you love board games.

31
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,702
You know they have exploded.

32
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,902
Board game growth is now kind of exponential.

33
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:49,843
It is more than a billion dollar industry.

34
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:54,303
While it's kind of tapered off for video games on Kickstarter, board games on Kickstarter

35
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:55,304
have gone insane.

36
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:56,564
We have now...

37
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:56,884
It's...

38
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:01,564
3,500 board games were released last year,

39
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:03,344
up from 1,000 in 2000,

40
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:05,624
and about 2,500 in 2005.

41
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,185
It doesn't seem to be stopping.

42
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:12,466
With me to discuss this incredible phenomenon

43
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,746
is a series of panelists who can introduce themselves

44
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:16,246
better than I could introduce them.

45
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,887
So we're gonna start right here with...

46
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:21,347
Hi everyone, I'm Jonathan Yang.

47
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,207
I'm a game designer.

48
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:28,576
Somebody rude. It's a decent sized whoop.

49
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:35,560
I've designed a few games including Star Wars Imperial Assault, Doom the Board Game, and Bargain Quest.

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,142
Many of them have been with companies and some have been independent and on Kickstarter.

51
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:41,623
So, yeah.

52
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:49,587
Hi, I'm Tom Lehman. I'm the designer of Race for the Galaxy, many other board and card and dice games over the years.

53
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:55,386
I'm Andrew Fisher. I'm the board and card game manager at Fantasy Flight Games.

54
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,949
I've worked there for about seven years as a game designer.

55
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,291
I've worked on things like the Star Wars role-playing game,

56
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:05,594
the Rune Wars miniatures game, and most recently the Fallout board game.

57
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:11,559
Hello everyone, I'm Anna. I started in Facebook and social games when that was still a thing.

58
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,723
Then I moved into mobile games and now I'm working at a company that's making Dized.

59
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:20,345
It's an app that will help you learn board games so you don't have to read the rulebook.

60
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:21,961
Thank heavens.

61
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,282
I'm going to open with the same question I opened with last year, which is, we are at

62
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:30,663
a predominantly video games conference, so folks, what is exciting about being a board

63
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,864
games designer in 2018?

64
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:33,584
Why should we care about this?

65
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:36,485
Why should we all be here right now talking about board games?

66
00:03:38,726 --> 00:03:41,526
You're referring to we as in video game designers?

67
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,867
All of us, all of these folks who have turned up.

68
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,148
Can we justify ourselves at this conference?

69
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:47,948
Clearly we can.

70
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:48,828
I mean...

71
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,132
Board games are cool, right?

72
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,374
And getting cooler, which is nice.

73
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:58,378
Everyone in games are in basically the same business,

74
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,580
creating engaging, interactive experiences.

75
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,604
And board games are just as valid a medium of doing so

76
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:08,107
and provide a good window into how to do exactly that.

77
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,369
A big advantage of board games is

78
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:12,010
that none of the mechanics are under the hood,

79
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,213
the way a lot of video games can hide things with programming

80
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:16,074
or physics, et cetera.

81
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,333
in board games you just have like a letter you've written to the player on how to enjoy a game

82
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:27,717
and the margin for error is much lower there and it is a great way for video game designers to learn

83
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:36,762
game design and for any kind of designer to get better. I also think one thing that's

84
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:43,587
getting really exciting with board games is kind of the merging of the digital side and the tabletop side.

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,020
My talks today was on just this topic.

86
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,141
My department makes a lot of app-integrated games,

87
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:51,841
is what we call them.

88
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:54,142
They're basically board games that also require an app.

89
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,722
So they're a game that requires both digital and physical

90
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:57,702
components to function.

91
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:01,203
On top of this, a lot of the talks I've gone to today

92
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,264
are about integrating apps into the process of learning games,

93
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:08,044
into creating digital versions of board games.

94
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:09,665
And so I think the lines are blurring

95
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,085
between the two different forms.

96
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:13,085
They'll only continue to blur further.

97
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:16,373
as we introduce technologies like VR and AR,

98
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:19,335
and they become more accessible and more saturated

99
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:19,796
in the market.

100
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:24,579
I think board games are going to get bigger and bigger.

101
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,521
I don't think they've even seen the Golden Age yet.

102
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,202
It's a great time to jump into them,

103
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,684
if anyone here is thinking about changing careers.

104
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,747
Well, there's a valid point there.

105
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:37,049
I mean, your company, if I'm correct, is recruiting.

106
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,150
People are recruiting right now.

107
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,771
Yes, we're recruiting Unity developers.

108
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:41,752
We haven't reached that yet.

109
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,273
It's worth it for a bit.

110
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,463
putting that out there.

111
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,244
But have we reached saturation?

112
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:46,964
I don't think so.

113
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:48,945
No, I don't think so either.

114
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,766
I don't think we've even seen the beginning of how big board games can get.

115
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:52,587
Right.

116
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:53,927
It doesn't seem to be going away.

117
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:59,410
There is a graph that we put up on Sharpensitdown's news on Monday where someone had plotted the

118
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,552
growth of board games and it just goes like that over the last, what, 20 years.

119
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,273
It's just absolutely insane.

120
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,815
Anna, you work on apps that help people to learn board games.

121
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:14,310
which has always been one of the barriers of entry.

122
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,112
And I generally like to ask the panel,

123
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,994
is the way that we're learning these games changing?

124
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:23,756
I remember board games as a kid being drier,

125
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,237
generally having larger manuals,

126
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:26,758
the way old video games used to be.

127
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,380
It's not like that anymore, is it?

128
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,981
We're getting better at this?

129
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:33,703
Well, I think that people are trying

130
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,605
lots and lots of different approaches.

131
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:38,027
There's not only the integration with digital.

132
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:41,440
But there's also experiments like Freedom and Freeze

133
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,963
had three games this year, which basically start with,

134
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:49,346
draw a card, do what it says, flee, fear, and so on.

135
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:52,569
And there, you're building and learning the game

136
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,051
as you start playing it.

137
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:57,914
And he's just doing that without any app or anything,

138
00:06:58,174 --> 00:06:59,756
just building the game that way.

139
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:04,259
Legacy games also change things, because you're discovering,

140
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,861
perhaps, more of the game.

141
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:10,504
as you play, which we used to call this program learning

142
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:16,029
at one point, but now it provides a way where the players have a huge incentive

143
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,630
to actually learn the new rules

144
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,853
so they can figure out how the game state is evolving.

145
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,576
Yeah, so

146
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:30,000
the way games have evolved, the tutorials and the way to learn them have also

147
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,181
evolved with them, so we had

148
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,564
a huge upsurge of YouTube videos now that will teach you how to play a game.

149
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,914
But we're with our app where at least we're trying to go one step further and actually have

150
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:43,536
Someone there like a digital person at the table that will teach you how to play the game

151
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,957
I think board games will move more into that and I

152
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:51,479
But games will be designed that have tutorials built into them already

153
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,221
But there should be ways to play games that don't have that without a rulebook

154
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,722
So and touching briefly on

155
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,990
We're talking about games increasingly integrated with apps like

156
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,833
Mansion of Madness, 2nd edition, XCOM, things like that.

157
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,936
Is this the new future? Is it also the way forward?

158
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:12,701
That it's great to have an app that is the referee that does the shuffling for you?

159
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,744
There's an Imperial Assault app as well, right?

160
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,367
Surely this is the best way to play games now?

161
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,888
Just have someone else do all the legwork.

162
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,351
Well, it's really just another way to play games, right?

163
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:26,176
And it's not here to replace traditional board gaming.

164
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,439
I think these different forms are always going to exist.

165
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,325
But I do think that a future of using digital tools to help

166
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:39,067
even your traditional board games is definitely

167
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:40,288
going to be the case.

168
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:41,929
Look at the Dized app.

169
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,793
Look at YouTube channels that teach games and review games

170
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:45,993
like it.

171
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,024
all of your traditional games.

172
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:50,485
A lot of people are still, a lot of people

173
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:51,505
don't even read the rule books.

174
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:54,747
They go to How It's Played and other YouTube sites

175
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,048
and get it explained to them by somebody

176
00:08:57,108 --> 00:09:01,390
who is much better at it than your friend Paul, who's just

177
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,012
struggling through the learn to play at the gaming table.

178
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:04,672
That's right, Paul.

179
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:06,453
Actual fact.

180
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:11,975
So I do think, well, I don't think app integrated games

181
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:12,936
and technology.

182
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:17,407
integrated into the games is necessarily going to replace tabletop games, I definitely think

183
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,269
that technology augmenting even your traditional tabletop games is here to stay.

184
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,570
They're not going to fuse and board games and video games won't merge into something

185
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,311
more powerful that kills all of us.

186
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,152
Some horrible gaming Voltron.

187
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:31,912
Okay, that's fine.

188
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:38,394
Well, there's certainly some resistance to always putting an app in a game because there

189
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:40,675
are people who say they spend the entire day.

190
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:43,685
looking at their screens, looking at their phones,

191
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:45,546
and when they want to play a board game,

192
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,226
they don't want to look at their phones.

193
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,547
So I think you're going to see a spectrum

194
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,428
where some people are all in favor of the apps,

195
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:55,809
all in favor of integrating apps into the gameplay,

196
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:58,330
and some people are going to be resistant to it.

197
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,031
And I think it's great, because the hobby is growing,

198
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:04,252
we have the capability to satisfy

199
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,853
many more different interests and gaming tastes

200
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,333
than we had 15 years ago.

201
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,909
And there will always be those purists, right?

202
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,810
The people who just want, you know,

203
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,351
I want my tabletop gaming to be viable

204
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:17,951
after the nuclear apocalypse,

205
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,472
where like I won't need any electricity,

206
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,052
I won't need any batteries or anything,

207
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:23,873
I can just play what I wanna play.

208
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:27,454
And you know, for them, we will continue to produce games

209
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,255
at as high a quality as we can manage.

210
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,216
And I think at the end of the day though,

211
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:34,837
a big thing to understand is that

212
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:39,826
all tabletop gaming has a pretty fundamental priority of the player, right?

213
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:45,369
And I always say this quote from Tim Fowers, but what we do is we make software that runs

214
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:52,012
on people, which is, at its core, even the app integrated stuff, right?

215
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:57,674
That stuff is, in some cases, not meant to replace the player, though sometimes it is.

216
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:04,557
It is meant to give the players a valuable experience that is interesting and lets them

217
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:05,098
not have to...

218
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,942
do things that aren't as exciting or aren't the game, like shuffling.

219
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:12,123
No, John, someday we're just going to have apps playing board games.

220
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:12,963
With each other?

221
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:16,265
Cut the human out of the equation, you know, just games playing games.

222
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:22,347
I mean, if the apps have money, someone will do it.

223
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:28,130
I have news for you about the someday, neural net AI can already do that.

224
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,550
I think there's some talks on that.

225
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,911
It's called Grimm.

226
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:32,952
Well, speaking of...

227
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:35,398
Grimmer things.

228
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,479
We all grew up with video games to some degree,

229
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,880
and we're used to video game piracy.

230
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,681
Increasingly, and I'm still trying

231
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,522
to put my head around this, and there's

232
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,623
been more and more news about this over the last year or so,

233
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,864
increasingly, board game piracy is a thing.

234
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:54,005
There are folks out there who will scan in a board game,

235
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,606
they're scanning all the cards, and they'll just

236
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,847
print a cheaper version of it and make that available

237
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,928
to purchase, perhaps overseas.

238
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:02,569
And to maybe a not so savvy customer,

239
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:03,950
if you're buying the.

240
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:09,978
discount budget copy version of the game or the original you may not know the difference and you may just think that you are

241
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:11,620
Saving a third or a half of the price

242
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,524
Apparently this has been happening for a while, but I've only recently become more aware of it

243
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:22,247
I wanted to ask any of you if you've been affected like directly or indirectly

244
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:26,931
By this and also how you would think you would address a problem like this

245
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,694
Well Rio Grand Games has had it with both race and Dominion

246
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:35,857
And they are working pretty aggressively with Amazon

247
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:39,578
to try to shut down the sellers of counterfeit.

248
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:43,359
And in fact, one of Rio Grande's employees

249
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,560
was testifying in court in New York a week ago about this.

250
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,681
So they're working on it.

251
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,242
I mean, you know Asmodee.

252
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,342
Well, yeah.

253
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:56,483
I mean, we haven't been greatly impacted by it.

254
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:59,584
This isn't a huge thing on our radar.

255
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:00,564
And honestly, we see.

256
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,591
less problems with printed piracy.

257
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,052
Often, you know, if all the files

258
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:09,813
of the game get online, it's still almost as expensive

259
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:12,875
as just going to the store and buying a nice copy for a customer to print

260
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,276
a copy and reproduce all of the components of the game.

261
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:19,037
One of the bigger things we tend to see is actually

262
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:21,919
digital reproductions of our games on different

263
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,240
websites or different, like, tabletop portals.

264
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,841
I mean, they're really useful to the players,

265
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,202
but, you know, these...

266
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:34,242
these are kind of pirated digital versions of our games.

267
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:35,802
And so that's what we see more often.

268
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,783
Really, I think our main approach to this

269
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:44,944
is to kind of try to, what are we missing for these players?

270
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:50,885
And a lot of this is the ability to actually get our content

271
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:51,705
to wherever they live.

272
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:54,986
And so I think one thing that we're looking to in the future

273
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:55,166
is like.

274
00:13:56,178 --> 00:14:03,262
For example, all of our RPGs that we print, tabletop RPGs we make, are available on DriveThruRPG as PDFs.

275
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:08,704
And I think digital distribution of board games is something that we can look to in the future.

276
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:12,086
3D printing is becoming more and more viable as consumer tech.

277
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:20,470
And so these are things that we can look to as an industry as ways of basically selling to these consumers

278
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,712
who want to get everything digitally, basically, and appealing to them.

279
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:28,037
I mean, I think a big part of this situation is awareness, right?

280
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:31,898
Like, the issue isn't that some people...

281
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,398
So when some people buy pirated games or they buy counterfeit copies,

282
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:38,919
they aren't buying them just because they, you know, want to get...

283
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,599
just because they want to get a good deal.

284
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:43,420
Sometimes it's the only deal on the table for them, right?

285
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,941
Like, it's actually a similar situation in video games.

286
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,621
Like, I think CD Projekt Red...

287
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:53,954
was involved, like I was talking to some of them about how video games in their country

288
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:58,976
were very hard to come across, but you can buy counterfeit CDs fairly readily, and if

289
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,317
they didn't have those, they just wouldn't have video games.

290
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,698
And then we wouldn't have The Witcher, right?

291
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:05,999
We'd have the books, not the games.

292
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:14,322
And on that front, I personally don't really have a huge problem with cheaper reproductions

293
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:17,143
being made to service markets that we don't service in the first place.

294
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:22,780
My main problem is when, say, like regular consumers on Amazon who are like expecting,

295
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,324
you know, the normal quality game are making this uninformed decision and being duped by

296
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:28,645
counterfeit publishers.

297
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:33,208
And that is something that I think is definitely that we need to address and has to do with

298
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:34,709
supply lines and printing costs.

299
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,772
And it's a real issue since in China are, you know, I've been talking to factories.

300
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,463
And more and more factories are getting into the board game scene because it's so profitable and so cool.

301
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:49,467
And that means that there's more and more means to produce games as expensively or cheaply as you want.

302
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:54,730
And all you have to do is send them digital files and ask them to print it.

303
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,911
And they're not... Some factories don't even know.

304
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,753
They just assume, oh yeah, this is just the game that you made, right?

305
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:00,494
They don't know everything.

306
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:03,916
The Chinese factories may have never heard of Race for the Galaxy.

307
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:06,641
And so they're just being told, hey, can you print this game?

308
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:07,722
And here are my files.

309
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,223
And they're like, sure, here are the specs.

310
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:10,083
Here's how much it costs.

311
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,045
And then you can get a huge print run

312
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,627
of false Race for the Galaxy copies

313
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,930
and then sell them as your own, which sucks.

314
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,253
But I'm personally not sure what the solution to that would be.

315
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,515
It's just the magnitude of the problem.

316
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,238
So I mean, I was going to say, is this just not going to go

317
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:28,438
away?

318
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:30,159
Is this now going to be a feature of the industry

319
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,061
the way it's still kind of a feature of the video games

320
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:32,401
industry?

321
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,624
I mean, people still want to pirate things, right?

322
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:36,945
It's availability, right?

323
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:39,226
Like, music piracy dropped tremendously

324
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,967
the second most people could have access

325
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:43,768
to easily streamable content, right?

326
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,169
So if we reach a state where board games

327
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:48,550
are super readily available at reasonable prices,

328
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,831
which I don't know if we'll hit that state,

329
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:53,913
but if we do, then absolutely piracy

330
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:54,953
will probably drop off a cliff.

331
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:57,675
But until then, I think this is something

332
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:58,715
we might need to learn to.

333
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,437
Right, another strategy also is that

334
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:05,285
Some of my games were now producing Chinese editions,

335
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:09,207
already localized, working with Chinese printers to print,

336
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,609
and separate European editions with different artwork

337
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,371
and so on, so that we can sell two products

338
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:19,773
in two different markets with different margins.

339
00:17:19,813 --> 00:17:20,953
This is something I've been working

340
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,374
with several publishers.

341
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:25,016
Question for you, actually.

342
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:28,758
Do you have different quality levels or different margins

343
00:17:28,838 --> 00:17:29,038
for?

344
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:33,216
those print runs where it's like say if this community is slightly less wealthy

345
00:17:33,256 --> 00:17:35,277
are you going to sell it at a lower price point in that

346
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:39,718
market? I don't believe there's any explicit setting

347
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:42,840
but if you are obviously working with different printers

348
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,281
then there may be different local standards as to what

349
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,963
you know how thick is the cards and so on.

350
00:17:56,301 --> 00:18:02,883
Like, we as the publishers are working on a lower profit margin than American distributors.

351
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:25,400
Distribution still being one of the biggest challenges for the industry because I feel like most of us I've been living in Canada

352
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,661
I'm currently in the US and you live in Finland you folks live all summer in the US

353
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:38,364
Getting board games in Canada is surprisingly difficult sometimes especially because people just order them from America or drive to America because it's nearby

354
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,425
How is it getting board games in Finland?

355
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,298
It's okay.

356
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:44,039
Right.

357
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:48,582
I've been trying to get Fog of Love, but it's a Walmart exclusive, so it's very difficult

358
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:49,983
in Europe to get something like that.

359
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:51,244
I don't know.

360
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:57,749
A lot of board games are made here and made exclusively or sent to the United States,

361
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:02,512
and then shipping is really expensive to Europe, so I don't know.

362
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:06,155
It sounds to me like this is still one of the obstacles that the industry has created

363
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:06,656
for itself.

364
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:07,536
Is that fair to say?

365
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:09,518
Well, I think it's created by the medium.

366
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:13,168
Right. Just like, you know, they're physical games.

367
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:18,310
And so by nature, we have to print them and ship them to somewhere.

368
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:23,513
And so to get them all over the world to everybody that might want them,

369
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,334
you need a massive distribution network.

370
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:29,616
You know, Asmodee has has a pretty large one.

371
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:33,478
You know, they have studios, you know, all over the world now.

372
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:36,660
And they have a pretty large and extensive distribution network.

373
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,501
But they still, you know, struggle to get games everywhere they want it to be.

374
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:44,551
And certain countries like Australia see pretty large markups in price on these.

375
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:49,355
And so distribution, I think, is always going to be a challenge for physical product.

376
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,476
It's just a fact of the matter.

377
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:57,281
But like I said, I think digital distribution of stuff could help with that, help with accessibility.

378
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:03,486
Things like 3D printing and print and play and things like that can definitely help people

379
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:09,390
who aren't kind of as part of the main game network get access to these things.

380
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:13,167
And just on that point very quickly, is there anybody in here from Australia right now?

381
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:17,972
Can I ask you to yell out sort of how much you pay for the average board game? $80?

382
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:21,175
Wow. $80.

383
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:25,279
That still seems more than like $30 or $40.

384
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,221
Like even with the exchange rate, right?

385
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:35,052
Right, now one of the other things affecting is simply that the cost of shipping has gone up a lot over the last 10 years.

386
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:39,775
But then, I mean, I would immediately say why are we making things overseas and then already shipping them once and then...

387
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:42,337
It's so much cheaper to make them in China.

388
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:46,440
Even when you put them on boats and drag them halfway around the world, it's still cheaper?

389
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,542
I mean, most of your customers are going to be in the US if I've used their numbers or anything to look at.

390
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:54,045
You know, that's why Shucks is in America and not...

391
00:20:54,834 --> 00:21:00,557
And in many cases, the parts are being done, but then the printing's done in Europe or the United States.

392
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:04,779
So you have some division there, so you're not shipping everything twice.

393
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:08,440
So the solution, maybe at some point, is if we can just print them all in a house.

394
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:11,282
That would be nice.

395
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,523
I can think of worse things to do.

396
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:16,544
We briefly mentioned legacy games before.

397
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:21,447
Are they here to stay?

398
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:22,367
It feels like...

399
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:27,672
doing we just had werewolf legacy announced risk legacy was now what six or seven years ago

400
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:33,997
pandemic legacy seafall it feels like this is the sort of the flavor of the moment sharp and sit down

401
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:38,441
has looked at a number of legacy games over the last year or two and liked some of them and not

402
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:45,527
being as excited as others i feel like this is a bubble that might burst or that these games work

403
00:21:45,547 --> 00:21:48,129
really well sort of cooperatively but as soon as

404
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:52,788
it becomes a competitive complex thing like Seafall or Charterstone, it kind of falls over.

405
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:56,231
Is this just gonna, are we gonna get bored of these within a couple of years?

406
00:21:57,512 --> 00:22:03,536
Personally, I like legacy games. I think, I've always thought of myself, not so much as a game

407
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:09,680
designer first, but as a storyteller. And legacy games increase our ability to tell stories.

408
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:16,645
As far as the cooperative, I think it's a natural extension of cooperative games.

409
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:21,231
to go the legacy route, and I'm sure that that will continue.

410
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,152
That's not a bus.

411
00:22:22,612 --> 00:22:25,634
Competitive ones, and I can say that I've designed one,

412
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,997
but it hasn't been announced, are another beast.

413
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:34,920
And I had to go through a lot of trials and tribulations

414
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,800
along the way.

415
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:40,824
So I'm not so sure that they will continue,

416
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:43,365
but I suspect as we design more tools.

417
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:47,223
as we come up with more ways of dealing with the various issues,

418
00:22:47,664 --> 00:22:49,725
that you'll see more of them that will be good.

419
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,887
Is the challenge being, if it's a cooperative game,

420
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:56,088
it's almost as if you're designing for one player,

421
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,469
you're designing for a group who are all in the same situation.

422
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:02,951
Is the challenge that things become imbalanced over a series of games

423
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,272
when it is player versus player and there are winners,

424
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:06,593
separate winners and losers?

425
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:10,995
Well, as was discussed by Mr. Honeycutt here in the last session,

426
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:13,477
you know, you have the runaway leader problem.

427
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:18,747
Yes. And how you deal with it, do you introduce a second meta-currency?

428
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:21,849
There's a number of different approaches that you can use.

429
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,553
I mean, I think that the surest way to put your foot in your mouth at one of these is to like

430
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:35,276
make a hard and fast declaration of what will happen. So I don't, I honestly don't know how,

431
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:39,299
whether legacy games are going to fizzle out or not, though I doubt that they'll disappear

432
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,900
entirely, right? They've done well enough, people like them.

433
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:47,206
I think one of my major concerns is honestly the, there are a couple of weaknesses within

434
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:50,287
the legacy format, which is the disposable nature of it, right?

435
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,589
A lot of players don't like the idea of a game that they can't continue playing all

436
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:57,750
the time, which is kind of a silly response when it's like I barely play the games I own

437
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,691
more than 12 times at a, you know.

438
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:00,672
And then sell them for nothing.

439
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:01,352
Right.

440
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:06,994
And then sell them for like, but then there's also, you know, this idea of once you've started

441
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:10,356
a legacy game with a group, you are committed and it's like you either have to try and reel

442
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:10,936
it back or.

443
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:17,314
start again and like it's hard to introduce new people more than once to a single legacy

444
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:17,634
item.

445
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:22,559
Uh, I think it's going to be a challenge and I'm really interested to see what techniques

446
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,900
the industry does to mix it up.

447
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:32,968
Uh, and I mean, I know Jr is going to, yeah, give him a mic up here, up the podium very

448
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:33,328
quickly.

449
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:35,190
You can be a special guest.

450
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:36,604
There you are.

451
00:24:36,844 --> 00:24:38,784
Games designer, JR Honeycutt.

452
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:42,186
The only person up here in shorts.

453
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:43,926
Yep, I'm really very sorry about that.

454
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:44,846
I didn't mean to jump in.

455
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:49,148
You asked what Legacy games have done

456
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:50,968
to the environment of board games

457
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,449
and whether they're gonna stick around, right?

458
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:54,470
Whether or not Legacy games stick around,

459
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,110
I think the impact they've had on games

460
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,311
in the last two years, since the first quarter

461
00:24:58,351 --> 00:24:59,991
of sales for Pandemic Legacy came out,

462
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:01,952
have been that it's pushing players,

463
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,893
or pushing designers who wouldn't normally include

464
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:07,443
deep narratives in games to include those deep narratives.

465
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,023
And I think you see it in Kickstarter,

466
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:11,484
there's both a push and a pull for designers

467
00:25:11,504 --> 00:25:13,744
to start actually working deeply on maintaining

468
00:25:13,784 --> 00:25:15,405
a real connection between the narrative mechanisms

469
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:15,985
of board games.

470
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:18,206
And it's making for better products, right?

471
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,446
And you're seeing it in the quality of games

472
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,846
in the last year or two years,

473
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:24,107
like Rise of Hellas is a game that wouldn't have existed

474
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,867
if legacy games hadn't enforced it.

475
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,048
And Subnecontinent has some influences there too, so.

476
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,629
All right, thanks.

477
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:35,885
And just quickly following from that, I wondered asking Anna and Andrew,

478
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:40,688
surely something app-supported is ideal for a legacy format,

479
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,829
if it does a lot of the work for us?

480
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,890
I don't think we've even seen the start of what legacy games can do,

481
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,612
and I think they're going to stick around for a long time to answer your previous question.

482
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:53,614
But I think app-supported legacy games are going to be great for players

483
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:57,356
who are hesitant about destroying their games or not being able to play them again,

484
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:01,498
and will introduce a whole new mechanic to games.

485
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:10,529
I also think that you'll see some fusion between app-driven legacy games and LARPs, which is

486
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,930
a whole different area.

487
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,891
I want the app legacy game that's like, and then break your iPad.

488
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,433
Yeah, yeah, color in on your iPad.

489
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:26,337
I think a lot of our existing app-integrated games that Fantasy Flight makes kind of have

490
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:30,259
a campaign aspect and have permanent choice across many, many plays.

491
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:30,999
We do that.

492
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,881
permanent aspect in the app, but at the same time, it's not really considered a legacy

493
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:37,581
game by players.

494
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:43,082
I think integral to the definition of legacy is the permanence, the physical permanence

495
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:43,342
of it.

496
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:50,524
You don't see anybody complaining about having to make permanent choices in our ongoing campaigns

497
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:56,745
in say like the Road to Legend app for Descent, or our Legends Alliance app for Imperial Assault.

498
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:59,445
That's just standard game campaigns.

499
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:06,155
I think there's that physical aspect of the disposability of it that gives that permanence to the decision.

500
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:11,958
And to throw my answer into the pot, and stick my foot in my mouth, as John said...

501
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:13,598
Your feet taste fantastic.

502
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:15,199
Yeah, that can't be true.

503
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:25,383
I think that legacy as a mechanic is a tool that we've added to our collective toolbox.

504
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:30,153
It is a, I think Mark Rosewater from Watt Wizards calls it a technology.

505
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:34,295
This is now a tool we have, and yeah, it's super hot right now, right?

506
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:37,857
But it's like deck building when Dominion first hit.

507
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:39,097
Deck building was huge!

508
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,258
You saw so many deck builders.

509
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:42,779
You definitely see fewer deck builders now.

510
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:45,260
Oh, and very different ones.

511
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,161
Yeah, and very different ones, but you definitely still see deck building mechanics, and they

512
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,603
often come as like an aspect, a portion.

513
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,001
of the game. You see very few dedicated deck builders anymore, but you see a lot of games that

514
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:01,503
have a deck building aspect. And so I think in similarly we'll see the same thing with legacies,

515
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:08,666
the legacy mechanic as it seems to have been termed. And I think we'll see it used in different

516
00:28:08,726 --> 00:28:13,189
unique ways by designers as just a tool in the toolbox, even after it wanes in popularity.

517
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:18,011
Yeah, definitely. I think since board games is such a growing industry and more and more players

518
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,652
come into it, maybe players that have played computer games before,

519
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:25,338
are used to longer campaigns and playing over several, several sessions the same game,

520
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:31,642
Legacy is something that is going to stick around for those players.

521
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:35,505
Yeah, no, that's valid. Many of us video gamers are...

522
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:40,180
something in our DNA that makes us sort of genetically campaign kind of people.

523
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,303
And I don't know exactly where you draw the line between a legacy game and a campaign.

524
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:50,367
I will say on the, if we are to, for this conversation, refer to legacy as games that

525
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:57,092
involve a sort of emotional, like physical sacrifice as part of the experience, right?

526
00:28:57,372 --> 00:28:59,854
Destroying components, permanently altering things.

527
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:05,158
It is actually really exciting when video games have started doing things like that.

528
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:12,468
Nier Automata and Doki Doki Literature Club both have game elements that involve permanently

529
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:13,968
altering the player's save file.

530
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:19,031
Nier Automata has a mechanic that allows you to actually remove your save file completely

531
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:20,612
for a specific purpose.

532
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:25,815
That is, I won't spoil, but that is a genuinely deep and emotional decision that you can make

533
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,876
which feels akin to burning a card in a Legacy game.

534
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:30,857
Or you know, a whole deck of them.

535
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,179
Video games, huh?

536
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,280
Video games, right?

537
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:38,587
I'm going to ask one or two quick more questions to our panel of experts.

538
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,288
In the meantime, if anyone has things they'd like to throw at us,

539
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:43,029
please start queuing up. There's a microphone over there.

540
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,010
Do not be scared of it.

541
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,912
We got a lot of different questions about a lot of different topics last year.

542
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:50,253
And I feel that the folks that we have this time,

543
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:53,134
we have a very good spectrum of experience.

544
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:57,497
Speaking briefly about video games,

545
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:01,239
I play Carcassonne now mostly on my phone.

546
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,160
There is now a very good Race for the Galaxy app.

547
00:30:04,988 --> 00:30:08,309
Do any of you worry that this is going to take over the hobby,

548
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,769
or that we're going to lose our physical versions of some

549
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:11,389
of these games?

550
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:13,790
Are we going to just play these games online with each other

551
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,710
instead of in person?

552
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,131
There are games that, oh, you want to go?

553
00:30:18,271 --> 00:30:18,931
I'm going to say no.

554
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,812
I think there's something magical about tactile games

555
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:26,452
and ripping cards for like, for example,

556
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:28,873
and playing with cubes and rolling dice

557
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,933
that an app can't really get rid of.

558
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,914
I will say there are games that I do feel are fundamentally improved after their transition

559
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:37,474
to an app.

560
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:41,658
Games like Nieroshima Hex, which is a good game, but I just find kind of exhausting to

561
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:42,298
play physically.

562
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,801
Just because of the way it's fiddly to deal with the components.

563
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:51,706
And when you don't have to constantly worry about managing all of those, then it helps

564
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:52,166
a lot.

565
00:30:52,687 --> 00:30:56,370
Or Mansions of Madness is a good example of one that was improved by an app.

566
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,932
And there are games that go, it's a spectrum, so there are games that go all the way to

567
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:00,313
just being...

568
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:07,385
completely better by being entirely on an app and games that become completely different in an app like seven wonders is

569
00:31:08,006 --> 00:31:12,807
You know a kind of like solid kind of mid weight game once it's on an app

570
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:17,367
It's super lightweight because there's no like you're not doing the experience of handing cards to each other

571
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:20,268
You're not experiencing like laying them out and like looking over your things

572
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:27,169
Everything is just kind of very snappy and your decision-making has changed completely to just one thing and there's no

573
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,470
physicality to it

574
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,650
And it was interesting to me because I didn't realize that there was so

575
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:38,352
That so much of the seven wonders experience is that communal playing with components

576
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:44,593
Like drafting cards by handing them to another person next to you that feels nice and is part of the thing

577
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:51,114
Well, you said it yourself at the beginning of this panel actually, which is that

578
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:51,474
we

579
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:58,985
the number of released board games each year is ballooning, right?

580
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:00,786
With 3,500, you said?

581
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,427
Something like 3,500 plus last year.

582
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:05,948
We're not running out of board games.

583
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,649
Honestly, this is an industry that is still rapidly growing

584
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:12,810
and rapidly integrating with the digital industry,

585
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:17,632
and so I don't think we have to be concerned about some kind of takeover.

586
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:20,793
I mean, we were worried when video games started happening,

587
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,713
and then, hey, we did okay.

588
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:27,234
Yeah, that's fair enough. Very quickly, Tom, I mean, Race for the Galaxy now is an app.

589
00:32:27,254 --> 00:32:30,036
Do you feel it's lost that card physicality? Is something missing?

590
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:35,340
Well, I will say that the person who came up to me and told me how they play it on the

591
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,703
toilet every morning, that was something I had not expected.

592
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:46,168
And questions from the audience. You, sir, at the front of the line.

593
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:51,312
Hello. Hello. How do I follow that up? I was wondering

594
00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:52,112
if the panel could...

595
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:58,250
give us a check-in on the state of diversity in board games,

596
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,750
both geographically and identity.

597
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:04,691
I know the answer generally is not good enough,

598
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:09,833
but if you can maybe signal boost or shout-outs

599
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:14,114
or let us know how that's going, what's happening.

600
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:17,535
First of all, I have a short thing about this

601
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,376
that I was gonna read or say at the end of the session,

602
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,236
but I'll say it in a moment.

603
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:21,756
But also...

604
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:25,736
It's coming out of the mouth of a white guy, so how about someone who isn't a white guy

605
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:29,198
would like to talk about how they feel in this industry right now?

606
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:30,799
Would that be okay?

607
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:33,061
I think the diversity is awful in board games right now.

608
00:33:34,542 --> 00:33:39,445
Coming from video games and seeing all the indie devs here, the pronouns and stuff like

609
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:45,949
that, and then stepping into the board game industry two years ago, almost, it was kind

610
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:50,112
of shocking to see the lack of diversity happening at the moment.

611
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:56,233
I mean, the magnitude of the issue should not be understated, right?

612
00:33:56,273 --> 00:34:01,574
Like this industry has been primarily servicing a very particular audience for a long time,

613
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:08,376
an audience that absolutely deserves good games, but it's not, it hasn't been inclusive

614
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,597
as a priority, right?

615
00:34:10,557 --> 00:34:16,599
Which means that it caters specifically to its own audience and has a tough time spreading

616
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,499
that love around, if you will.

617
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,407
Luckily, there are some great designers and other people, including people right here,

618
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:28,411
who are working hard at increasing diversity, increasing representation in games, making

619
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:33,354
players more comfortable at events, and trying to just be ambassadors to other people.

620
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:39,938
Because this hobby will only improve with more viewpoints, with more perspectives.

621
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:45,622
If we keep having the same people making games, or making games for the same people, we'll

622
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:47,123
keep making the same games.

623
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:52,207
But the more people we bring in, the more perspectives we have,

624
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:54,228
the more interesting experiences we have.

625
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:55,990
And that's what everyone wants, honestly.

626
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,092
I just want to talk a bit more about the accessibility issue.

627
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:02,455
At least with our app, a thing that we're trying to do

628
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,697
is make board games more accessible to people.

629
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,639
So you don't have to read this huge rule book to play them.

630
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,580
You can just start and experience board games

631
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,262
and fall in love with them and become a designer.

632
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,725
And geographic accessibility is hard as well, because like,

633
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:17,697
As we've discussed, shipping is hard.

634
00:35:18,017 --> 00:35:20,820
And so not just shipping, but also manufacturing a product

635
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,801
to serve different markets and different languages.

636
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:24,643
Like there are a lot of considerations

637
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:25,724
that have to be made for that.

638
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:29,167
And when it's a physical product, it's just difficult.

639
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:31,749
When it's an expensive physical product, it's even harder.

640
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,091
And it's like, what happens when you have so much stock

641
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,252
of this in this language?

642
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:38,275
And like, oh, you're making all of these decisions

643
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:40,077
and at any point it can go wrong.

644
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:42,719
And so a lot of publishers are really gun shy about that.

645
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:47,221
And so I feel like we as consumers need to be very enthusiastic and ask for these things

646
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:51,384
because that is kind of how the current capitalist interplay works.

647
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:52,124
So...

648
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:56,487
Hey, Anna, can I briefly ask, you have been an indie dev as well, you've been a video

649
00:35:56,527 --> 00:35:58,809
games developer, so you've seen both sides of the thing.

650
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:03,132
How does it feel, like you have been to a couple of board game events now, to come back

651
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:04,293
to a video games con?

652
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:05,533
You're suggesting it's...

653
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:05,974
It's great.

654
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:07,795
It's really great here at GDC.

655
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:09,296
I mean, everyone's so exclusive...

656
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:09,876
Inclusive.

657
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:10,897
Inclusive.

658
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:11,337
Inclusive.

659
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:11,758
Inclusive.

660
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:12,478
Inclusive.

661
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:19,443
And there's just so much diversity and it's great seeing so many women and non-binary

662
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:23,445
people and you just don't see that at board game events.

663
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:30,487
I mean, the customers are women and non-binary people, but the people making content is just

664
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:31,028
white guys.

665
00:36:33,048 --> 00:36:35,509
I'm going to say something about this, and this is what I was going to say at the end.

666
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:38,750
I read something really saddening last month.

667
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:43,367
retrospective about the impact of Gamergate, of which there is still a lot of fallout.

668
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:48,449
And it was about the amount of young women who had written to leading women in the industry

669
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:52,531
saying that they're not going to work in games because of what happened.

670
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,912
It's a very real casualty rate.

671
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:02,075
And those are careers, and those are games, and those are ideas that we never get to see,

672
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:06,997
because those people have decided that they don't want to put up with the BS of everything

673
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:07,597
that has happened.

674
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,124
And I still have many conversations with women peers and with people of color

675
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:17,728
about the difficulties and the obstacles that they still encounter in the industry like now.

676
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,471
A writer who's really dear to me passed away last month,

677
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,674
which is a lady called Ursula Le Guin, who was a science fiction titan.

678
00:37:25,054 --> 00:37:27,957
For most of her career, she's a woman working in a man's world,

679
00:37:28,297 --> 00:37:33,141
and she's all too aware of the imbalances, and she challenged them, she called them out.

680
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:36,424
This is something that she actually said at a convention.

681
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:42,063
kind of, I don't know, not a hundred miles away from something like this convention we're at now,

682
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:49,569
she said, I'd like to ask the men here to consider, idly, in some spare moment,

683
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,393
whether by any chance they have been building walls to keep the women out,

684
00:37:55,294 --> 00:38:00,098
or to keep them in their place, and what they may have lost by doing so.

685
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,021
And that sounds really contemporary, doesn't it?

686
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:09,827
But that was actually said at a convention in 1975, and I hate that that just sounds

687
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:11,747
completely relevant today because it does.

688
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:17,389
It's a reminder that we've got to keep working hard, and that games, or science fiction,

689
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,910
or comics, all these industries that come on, let's face it folks, we're all adjacent

690
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,470
to each other.

691
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,231
We're all the same sorts of folks.

692
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,812
We still have this problem, and there's still so much that we have to do, and consciously

693
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:32,013
or unconsciously, it's folks like me who look like me, who are me.

694
00:38:32,692 --> 00:38:35,995
who perpetuate this and it's on folks like me,

695
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:37,636
who look like me and who are me,

696
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,178
to address it and to fix it.

697
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,222
That's, that would have been a really good finisher.

698
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:49,766
But it is, it's, I'm just frustrated that she said that.

699
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:53,449
Like before I existed, she was in a room full of mostly men

700
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:56,651
saying like, dudes, come on, get with it.

701
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,454
Sorry, that was a bit of a digression.

702
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:00,735
The next question, hello, hi.

703
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:09,588
So I kind of have a question slash comment in respect to the digitization of board games,

704
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:15,891
the convenience that it brings, and also the piracy of it, specifically tabletop simulator.

705
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:20,473
You're able to go on the workshop and just download literally every board game for the

706
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:23,334
most part, the ones that people have been willing to create.

707
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:26,227
Do you guys see that as a problem?

708
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:29,830
It's increasing accessibility, but you're not making any money from it.

709
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:34,515
And have you considered digitizing in some way similar to that?

710
00:39:34,795 --> 00:39:39,820
Or is there a possibility of partnering with Tabletop Simulator to form a contract?

711
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,205
Maybe not charging the users, but making money from what Tabletop Simulator gets in terms

712
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:48,868
of revenue by hosting your game on it in a more professional way.

713
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,633
At first, I mean, I think this is a really good point,

714
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:52,934
and it's only increasingly relevant,

715
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:55,556
because everybody I know has tabletop simulator.

716
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:58,097
But also, like how many of you folks have used it?

717
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,780
How many people here have played Surgeon Simulator?

718
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,302
Because for me, it's still an experience

719
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:06,123
where I'm trying to play a game, and I do this.

720
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,025
And that's me rolling my dice.

721
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:10,766
Yeah, it's certainly not the best,

722
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,848
but it's at least an opportunity to be able to play

723
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,589
with someone that's across the world.

724
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:16,510
It's kind of a cool thing.

725
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:20,465
It's tough, I'm not going to get away from the physical aspect of board games.

726
00:40:20,605 --> 00:40:21,065
Well, yeah.

727
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,746
So, I mean, I'll talk a bit about this.

728
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:26,006
I'm going to disclaimer what I'm going to say first, just because, like, you know, I

729
00:40:26,227 --> 00:40:27,267
am just a sole person.

730
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:32,128
I do not represent, you know, Fantasy Flight, Aspiday, or whatever, and like I can't speak

731
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:36,109
to, like, our corporate feeling on this, right?

732
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:40,770
But that being said, yeah, I played Tabletop Simulator.

733
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,170
Like I know tons of people who played Tabletop Simulator, right?

734
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:43,410
It's...

735
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,594
It's a great tool, and you're right, it is great for accessibility.

736
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:57,055
And putting games online like that is fantastic, but just as broadly across the industry, not

737
00:40:57,095 --> 00:41:01,456
everybody can just sign with Tabletop Simulator and give rights away, right?

738
00:41:01,496 --> 00:41:05,897
There's all sorts of different legal stipulations based on intellectual property, based on licenses,

739
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:11,618
based on quality assurance, you know, like, of, you know, the quality of the product that's

740
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,619
on Tabletop Simulator, and if it meets with a company's standards.

741
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:20,881
So, well, that model does work for some companies, it doesn't for others.

742
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:25,325
There's never going to be, I don't think, a world where every single board game company

743
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:29,969
all licenses with Tabletop Simulator and we have this one great digital portal for all

744
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:30,469
board games.

745
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:38,777
That being said, I think these kind of digitization projects are really awesome and really friendly

746
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:39,237
to fans.

747
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,392
I mean, like, but like, look at Race for the Galaxy, right?

748
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:47,094
By putting out a more controlled app experience,

749
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,615
they're able to offer an app that is way more functional

750
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:53,557
and way easier to use than Tabletop Simulator ever was,

751
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:55,978
right, and so some companies want to take approaches

752
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:56,758
like that instead.

753
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,160
Well, with Race and with quite a few of my games,

754
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,701
if it's a non-commercial enterprise,

755
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,882
I've done licenses with my games.

756
00:42:06,462 --> 00:42:08,723
Yukata has to court the king.

757
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:14,545
Board game arena had a race for many years and gave us no money.

758
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:20,850
So I'm in general in favor of non-commercial licenses

759
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:25,554
to anyone who's not making money off of it to do it.

760
00:42:25,574 --> 00:42:26,855
I think it's great.

761
00:42:27,075 --> 00:42:28,336
More people playing my games.

762
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:29,337
I'm all for that.

763
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:30,377
Nice.

764
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,479
Thank you very much.

765
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,241
I have one very minor thing to say.

766
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:36,362
But for me, like.

767
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:40,766
It feels kind of awkward to say this, but I do strongly feel that no one is playing

768
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:45,509
Star Wars Imperial Assault just for the experience of the rules.

769
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,633
They're playing it partly for the miniatures and for the enjoyment of being in a room with

770
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:54,476
their friends, you know, rolling dice and having this physical experience, which you

771
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:59,120
mentioned earlier about why we won't lose to digital apps anytime soon.

772
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,221
And I feel similarly about the tabletop simulator.

773
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:04,504
I think it provides a great service, but I don't think it's really harmful.

774
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:07,330
One other final note on that.

775
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:11,493
In some cases for some games, and I suspect that may be true

776
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:16,298
for Imperial Assault, there's third party licensing rights

777
00:43:16,438 --> 00:43:21,242
that may make it hard for a company to allow a game to do

778
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:25,626
it because their own contract to license the Star Wars, for

779
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,967
example, may preclude it.

780
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:30,690
So that's a obstacle that's really not at the game

781
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,531
publisher level.

782
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:33,930
it's at the IP licensing level.

783
00:43:34,231 --> 00:43:34,971
And that's valid.

784
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:38,513
I still think the biggest obstacle is that I just do that and all the miniatures fall

785
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:38,814
over.

786
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,956
But, maybe I have poor taste and I'm a Luddite.

787
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:46,939
Maybe it'll get really good eventually if they keep updating it.

788
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:47,599
That's fair.

789
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:48,520
Hi.

790
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:48,960
Hi.

791
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:56,685
So, I for a long time have thought that there's that spectrum between fully digital and fully

792
00:43:56,725 --> 00:44:00,387
physical board games with all these cool hybrid in between.

793
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:04,387
And I know there's fantasy flight interactive now

794
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:11,432
but also what do you guys think in general about the idea of studios that do board games and

795
00:44:11,512 --> 00:44:18,576
Video games that they come up with an idea and then they decide whether it's going to be physical or digital or a hybrid

796
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:21,338
Rather than being a company that just does one and then

797
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:27,722
Licenses out to another studio to do the the other right from a business point of view you have the problem at the moment the

798
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:30,204
Distribution networks are totally different

799
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:35,795
And so you have to assemble a different distribution network

800
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:38,736
if you're trying to get into the other industry either way.

801
00:44:39,536 --> 00:44:42,957
So if distribution gets solved, then I

802
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:45,858
think you'll see a lot more companies that

803
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:48,379
are willing to move a project either way.

804
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,121
I had a discussion about this with a gentleman earlier today

805
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:56,743
about the fact that I don't consider the actual game

806
00:44:56,803 --> 00:45:00,324
design that different implementation.

807
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:06,930
Very different but in terms of getting good gameplay. I don't consider them two different markets

808
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:09,731
No, that's fair enough

809
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:15,893
I was going to say on the design side as well anyone here know about fallout New Vegas being partly just paper prototyped

810
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:21,435
enormous fallout video game took a very long time a lot of people to make but it didn't have to have a few folks around

811
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:26,257
The table with bits of paper because it turns out that that's a valid way to design something

812
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,878
Yeah, I was doing a licensed game,

813
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:32,579
and I ended up playing a paper prototype of it

814
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:36,900
with executives from Warner Brothers Interactive

815
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,802
over Skype to show them where we were going long before we

816
00:45:41,842 --> 00:45:44,763
had any video game up and running.

817
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,683
Yeah, I mean, coming from a video game background,

818
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,644
I think paper prototyping is super important.

819
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:50,064
Before you even touch a computer,

820
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:51,785
you should paper prototype your mechanics

821
00:45:51,805 --> 00:45:52,625
to see if they even work.

822
00:45:54,402 --> 00:46:01,266
saying that I don't think there are many board game companies that also have access to making their own video games.

823
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:08,470
They usually just focus on board games, and then they'll maybe license it out to some other video game company.

824
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:11,232
I think, like, probably Fantasy Flight is the only one that has.

825
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:15,855
You might just get to the coast retiring.

826
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:20,238
Anna, am I correct that the... what was the race to the North Pole, the first DICE game...

827
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,328
that was developed to partly be an app supported board game,

828
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:26,229
app game, was that developed deliberately

829
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:28,189
sort of in parallel?

830
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:29,809
Yes.

831
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,970
Actually the designer of the game is right here.

832
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,551
He's like sitting right over there.

833
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:37,071
I'm not letting anyone else up here, sorry.

834
00:46:38,472 --> 00:46:40,012
We got more questions here.

835
00:46:40,052 --> 00:46:43,053
This whole photograph, like keep talking

836
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:44,793
and nobody is talking.

837
00:46:44,813 --> 00:46:47,494
It's different, like we learned something.

838
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:47,894
Oh yeah, I mean.

839
00:46:48,314 --> 00:46:50,535
Hybrid game, yeah.

840
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:52,573
Or the Jackbox TV games.

841
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:53,714
Yeah, Jackbox TV.

842
00:46:53,754 --> 00:46:56,916
Keep talking and nobody explodes for the recording.

843
00:46:57,937 --> 00:46:59,178
Yes, that was mentioned.

844
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:00,459
Keep talking and nobody explodes,

845
00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:03,541
which is as stressful as it sounds.

846
00:47:05,183 --> 00:47:07,545
Yeah, I'd say that the production is definitely

847
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:10,107
different from a video game and a board game.

848
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:12,609
And one of the things that ends up

849
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:14,310
changing the most for the final product

850
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,753
is those production budgets and the production pipeline.

851
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:21,673
You can't always fit everything that you want into a video game in there, and you also can't

852
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,714
fit everything inside the game box that you want to fit in there.

853
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:27,355
And I would like to just open this question to any of you.

854
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:32,517
How would you feel, how do you feel that designing board games specifically has changed your

855
00:47:32,557 --> 00:47:33,517
design methodology?

856
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:38,239
To say, I can only have so many cards, or I can only use so many different types of

857
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:41,360
pieces, and how has that influenced your designs?

858
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,281
I've got a weird answer for this one, actually.

859
00:47:45,101 --> 00:47:47,922
So I did a game on Kickstarter, which is quite exciting.

860
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:50,331
And on Kickstarters, we have these things called stretch goals.

861
00:47:51,231 --> 00:47:52,432
And when you do a stretch goal, you're like,

862
00:47:52,553 --> 00:47:54,094
we promise that if we make this much money,

863
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:55,975
we'll add this component or this mechanic.

864
00:47:56,015 --> 00:47:58,457
And often it's a physical component or mechanic.

865
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:03,101
And you can overpromise or you can make a decision

866
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:06,964
where you don't realize that producing this thing,

867
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:11,868
like say, poker cards are printed on a 54-card press form,

868
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:14,410
which means any increment of 54 cards is good.

869
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,791
But the second you go over that,

870
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,613
you have to make an entire new press form.

871
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:22,974
And so, like, we had a situation where we were like three cards over that we promised to backers,

872
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:29,920
and so we were paying for, you know, an extra dollar on the game's production cost, which is

873
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:36,145
like, was like 20% more for that particular element, which is, you know, these mistakes

874
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:41,249
can happen and they can sometimes end companies when they overpromise. And so that risk is

875
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,931
something that didn't exist when I was like at Fantasy Flight.

876
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:47,698
where we'd make a decision and be like, oh yeah, no, we can't have that many dice molds.

877
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,158
Change the mechanic and no one will know.

878
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:50,739
And it's fine.

879
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:58,183
Yeah, I do think what kind of games you work on and what kind of constraints you work on

880
00:48:58,843 --> 00:48:59,603
wire your brain.

881
00:48:59,923 --> 00:49:03,565
You see this all the time with designers.

882
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:08,687
Designers will work on one type of game for a while and then they'll move into a new genre of game

883
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:12,549
and they'll actually bring a lot of the knowledge they had from their other genre they're working on

884
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:13,310
into the new game.

885
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:17,438
and like you can kind of see it's like, oh, this game was designed by this person who

886
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:21,080
did this other kind of mechanic for a very long time and you totally can feel that in

887
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,581
the design.

888
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:28,285
I think similarly, constraints kind of train how people develop their skills over time.

889
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:32,548
But I mean, I think that's true in the digital space as well as the tabletop space.

890
00:49:32,628 --> 00:49:38,512
I mean, like, you know, this is the limit on this is constantly raising, but you have

891
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:41,954
like render limits and all that kind of thing that so, you know.

892
00:49:42,373 --> 00:49:45,255
People working on digital games have all sorts of constraints they're working under.

893
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,976
They're just a little different than the tabletop constraints of our printing budget.

894
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:54,438
I'm lucky enough that I do a lot of games for a publisher who says,

895
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:58,540
don't worry about the components, just get the game right.

896
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,501
What a dream.

897
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:00,001
Yeah.

898
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:03,562
Well, this can have some odd effects.

899
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:06,844
When we were doing Roll and we were well over 100 dice,

900
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:09,385
we went back to Jay Tummels and said,

901
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:10,945
do you really mean that?

902
00:50:11,472 --> 00:50:13,693
And he said, no, no, get the game right.

903
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:14,713
Don't worry about it.

904
00:50:15,653 --> 00:50:17,314
Then when he got the print quote,

905
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:22,495
there are a lot of dice in this game.

906
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:26,017
But he then worked a lot and tried different suppliers

907
00:50:26,117 --> 00:50:29,838
until he could do it at reasonable quality and cost

908
00:50:29,898 --> 00:50:30,398
and so on.

909
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:32,839
And he didn't place any constraints on us

910
00:50:33,459 --> 00:50:35,619
about how we do the games.

911
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,320
So it's.

912
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:43,494
you know, an interesting thing because there are times when we know we're pushing the limits.

913
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:47,775
And it's like, well, Gay hasn't complained yet.

914
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:54,757
Okay, very well. I love the idea of somebody, speaking as someone who writes an awful lot,

915
00:50:55,237 --> 00:51:00,018
the idea of a person saying just do whatever you like is, I love the idea of constraints. Someone

916
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:04,319
saying just do whatever is the least helpful thing in a creative industry. When people

917
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,659
put up barriers for you, I feel that gives you direction.

918
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:11,078
If somebody came to me and said no limits, I'd just be like, challenge accepted.

919
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:16,146
This is someone who has struggled against constraints.

920
00:51:21,347 --> 00:51:26,051
So I think that innovation tends to come from having expectations defied.

921
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:35,518
And certainly as games have proliferated, more and more we're playing games that, as players, deliver different kinds of experiences.

922
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:47,008
So what I'd love to hear from each of you, and certainly from you as well, Paul, is just the last game that you played that really surprised you, good or bad, that sort of helped you.

923
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:51,311
you see something that maybe you hadn't quite seen before or thought of before?

924
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:56,175
I'm gonna just throw that to the wolves

925
00:51:56,615 --> 00:52:02,259
while I think, so fill time for me. I think I've got an answer but folks, all of you, if you have an answer for this?

926
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,803
Well, you know what? I'm gonna go with a bad one, and I won't name the name, but I did play a game...

927
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:07,524
Oh, name and shame.

928
00:52:08,204 --> 00:52:11,246
I will not... Come on, guys. Let's be professional.

929
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:16,190
But I did play a game recently that was mechanically brilliant.

930
00:52:16,695 --> 00:52:21,858
had a lot of very good ideas and was, you know, overall, like, I really enjoyed playing

931
00:52:21,898 --> 00:52:21,958
it.

932
00:52:22,479 --> 00:52:29,403
But the wrapping of it, the sort of theme around it, was so incredibly uninteresting

933
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:29,803
to me.

934
00:52:30,323 --> 00:52:35,026
It was like a game where, like, the mechanics were beautiful, but the aesthetics were this

935
00:52:35,066 --> 00:52:38,068
very classical thing that I've seen a million times before.

936
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,390
You know, orcs, elves, it's, you know, it's...

937
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,551
I know what game this is.

938
00:52:44,392 --> 00:52:45,012
Don't tell anyone.

939
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:45,973
He has a theory.

940
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:50,599
But and sort of that understanding of like, you know

941
00:52:50,979 --> 00:52:55,521
Mechanics are important and very relevant and you can have the most brilliant mechanics in the world

942
00:52:55,841 --> 00:53:01,863
But if you're you know, but if the other elements of the game don't sink to it and don't make those mechanics sing

943
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:07,465
It's an experience can fall flat or the experience can just kind of be soured even

944
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:09,386
and

945
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:15,448
you know as a designer that now makes me much more cognizant of the themes that I choose and like I know some designers are

946
00:53:15,468 --> 00:53:15,708
just like

947
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:19,166
put whatever on it, you know, you hire the artists or whatever, but like now I'm making

948
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:24,209
very, you know, informed decisions about like how the art should look, how inclusive it

949
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:29,871
should be, that sort of thing is all decisions that should be made with thought and care.

950
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:42,437
So, um, I work with Wei Wah on the Roll series, and so he came up with something that'll be

951
00:53:42,477 --> 00:53:43,698
in the next expansion.

952
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:47,234
that effectively models credit asset swaps.

953
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:50,775
When I saw all the things you could do with it,

954
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,476
give up some of your treasury limit, get a die,

955
00:53:53,957 --> 00:53:56,718
sell this, do this, I mean, my brain exploded.

956
00:53:57,498 --> 00:54:01,200
And the thought that you could get something that dry,

957
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,920
you know, I mean, credit asset swaps,

958
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,702
not exactly the most exciting term in the world,

959
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:09,103
and make it come alive and make it work in a game

960
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:10,684
that had already been designed,

961
00:54:10,904 --> 00:54:13,945
so this is in an expansion, that blew my mind.

962
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:21,106
As far as games that don't work, I always have trouble playing lots of games because I'm very picky.

963
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:26,887
And when I play games, the hardest thing for me is I see what they could have been.

964
00:54:27,988 --> 00:54:29,788
And that just eats away at me.

965
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:34,209
I don't have time to play board games anymore.

966
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:37,570
Because you're making them.

967
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,891
But whenever, I did play one recently and the thing I notice now about games is the rule books.

968
00:54:44,358 --> 00:54:48,679
And this game blew my mind because I had a 50-page rulebook, and I did not have time for that.

969
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,120
Yep. Andrew, do you have one?

970
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,922
Yeah, so I think the last game that really surprised me was...

971
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:03,643
It's actually a series of games, the Exit series, for any of you who have played.

972
00:55:04,503 --> 00:55:08,264
They're a series of one-play escape room games.

973
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:12,685
They kind of simulate the experience of playing an escape room with the different puzzles

974
00:55:12,745 --> 00:55:13,945
and unlocking these different puzzles.

975
00:55:15,371 --> 00:55:18,072
And I don't really want to...

976
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:22,434
Since they're one use, and once you know the riddle, they're done. I'm not going to spoil any

977
00:55:22,454 --> 00:55:26,295
of them for you, but they each kind of break the rules

978
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:30,137
in ways you might not expect. And I found

979
00:55:30,197 --> 00:55:34,458
those games definitely surprised me at the table in a really good way, in a really enjoyable way.

980
00:55:34,478 --> 00:55:38,440
I encourage anyone who has a chance to go out and check out Exit or Unlock, or any

981
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,161
of the other kind of escape room type games. I think they do something really cool.

982
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:43,740
I think I saw a couple at the lounge.

983
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,101
Oh cool.

984
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:46,262
Yeah, there's a couple in there.

985
00:55:46,362 --> 00:55:50,325
I will very quickly say, having just played it, Fog of Love maybe, because it is sort

986
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:55,089
of cooperative, but not in a game where you hide information and choices from each other

987
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,491
and define your own objectives.

988
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,895
Like that's insane for something that is supposed to be cooperative.

989
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:03,897
There is a video up on our site about it, please check it out.

990
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:05,418
We've got a couple of minutes left.

991
00:56:05,618 --> 00:56:07,860
We can do I think at least two questions, maybe three?

992
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,781
Alright, hello.

993
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:16,127
Drawing a comparison to the video games where we don't really have to get it right the first time because we can easily distribute patches

994
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:17,847
I wonder if you could comment on

995
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:24,009
certain advantages possibly with having these in-app and integrations where you have the manual in the app or

996
00:56:24,129 --> 00:56:29,491
Certain challenges you've had with physical ones where you can't really change it until you have an expansion or something

997
00:56:32,112 --> 00:56:37,993
Printing a game and then finding errors before it's in consumers hands is the worst

998
00:56:38,983 --> 00:56:40,623
You know, we see it all the time, obviously.

999
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:45,305
The digital games are awesome because of that,

1000
00:56:45,425 --> 00:56:47,045
like our app-integrated games being

1001
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:48,066
able to patch things out.

1002
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:52,027
But also, digital games have a lot more bugs

1003
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:54,928
and have a lot more difficulties that come along with that.

1004
00:56:55,728 --> 00:56:59,409
And also, they require constant updating and patching

1005
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,570
is almost expected for them.

1006
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,971
So while it is awesome to finally

1007
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:06,152
be able to kind of change our products after launch,

1008
00:57:06,662 --> 00:57:11,204
It also comes with just a ton of ongoing maintenance and work for that product line going forward.

1009
00:57:12,865 --> 00:57:16,928
One of the features of our app is that you can update your rulebook.

1010
00:57:17,408 --> 00:57:22,751
So you can have your rules there, all indexed and referenced, and you can update them if

1011
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:25,193
you have a correction to make or a second edition that you're doing.

1012
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,015
So that's one of the cool things we're doing.

1013
00:57:28,395 --> 00:57:30,216
It feels like a tiny little miracle, actually.

1014
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:31,937
It's much harder with components, though.

1015
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,419
Like, I mean, I've had nightmares, and it is like...

1016
00:57:35,845 --> 00:57:41,167
there is a deeply unbalanced character that I put into Star Wars Imperial Assault due to my own

1017
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:47,669
failures that haunts me to this day. And you know, you can't, and like I know that there are

1018
00:57:47,689 --> 00:57:52,090
still copies out there that don't have the second edition version or that don't have competitive

1019
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:57,072
players who went out and got the eroded cards that we printed and gave out at tournaments. And like

1020
00:57:57,172 --> 00:58:01,394
I've just like made the experience slightly worse for anyone who bought that version of the game

1021
00:58:01,994 --> 00:58:03,955
and it kills me. And

1022
00:58:04,402 --> 00:58:06,862
I mean, we do produce ways around it, right?

1023
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:09,643
Like, FFG has done a lot of competitive physical games,

1024
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:13,165
and we'll print cards that are answers to cards

1025
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:15,185
that might have been a little too strong before,

1026
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,986
or cards that very specifically synergize

1027
00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:19,067
with slightly weaker cards that existed in the past.

1028
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:22,888
And that sort of design is often a very fun design challenge,

1029
00:58:22,908 --> 00:58:26,709
but it's kind of a result of our own human failings.

1030
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:29,850
But yeah, I mean, and errata is hard

1031
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,791
because most players don't look it up.

1032
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,431
You know, most players assume that we got it right, unfortunately.

1033
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:36,331
Never.

1034
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:38,392
One more, I think, please.

1035
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:38,752
Thank you.

1036
00:58:40,332 --> 00:58:41,072
It was a great talk.

1037
00:58:41,132 --> 00:58:41,753
Thank you very much.

1038
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:47,934
As someone who has recently made a large print edition of a beloved game for my parents to

1039
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:55,036
play, I was wondering if there's any particular focus in the industry to make visual accessibility

1040
00:58:55,196 --> 00:58:57,797
more of a thing, because our text is often very tiny.

1041
00:58:57,817 --> 00:58:59,278
Thoughts?

1042
00:58:59,298 --> 00:58:59,478
Thoughts?

1043
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,792
I mean, unfortunately, there is not a big push for that.

1044
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:07,053
I would like there to be.

1045
00:59:07,173 --> 00:59:08,694
I think that it would be very important.

1046
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:12,857
And I think the more people who make that request and who actually like send emails

1047
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:17,039
to publishers, like, I think it would be very cool if you, you know, showed people whoever

1048
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:20,381
published the original version of that game you made the updated version of, send them

1049
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:21,262
like, hey, we made this.

1050
00:59:22,122 --> 00:59:28,486
And just let them know because companies only, you know, their main focus is what their consumers

1051
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:28,987
are doing.

1052
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:32,166
And if consumers aren't emailing them and letting them know what they feel,

1053
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:37,190
they end up not thinking about it, which is unfortunate and thoughtless.

1054
00:59:38,711 --> 00:59:40,012
Right. I will say two things.

1055
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:43,555
We've been trying to improve the color blindness in our games.

1056
00:59:44,035 --> 00:59:51,561
But also I find that many of the people who do the graphics of games are in their 20s

1057
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:53,162
and they have excellent eyesight.

1058
00:59:54,283 --> 00:59:57,345
And I'm an old dude who wears glasses.

1059
00:59:57,878 --> 01:00:02,821
So I will complain myself about various features of games,

1060
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,262
and the graphic person is like, hmm,

1061
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:06,903
I didn't think that was a problem.

1062
01:00:07,463 --> 01:00:10,385
So there is some advantage for the old white dude still.

1063
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:14,967
I was going to say, surely apps have an audio element.

1064
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:17,568
Yeah, we are making sure that all our tutorials are

1065
01:00:17,849 --> 01:00:20,710
completely voiceovered so that you can just,

1066
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,812
and in different languages as well,

1067
01:00:24,572 --> 01:00:27,073
so it's as accessible as possible to as many people

1068
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:27,553
as possible.

1069
01:00:29,003 --> 01:00:32,686
I would quickly add, I don't know if any of you folks have heard of 64-ounce games.

1070
01:00:32,926 --> 01:00:36,749
They do braille overlays for things like cards and board games.

1071
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:40,371
So if you're playing a game like, I don't know, the Resistance Avalon, which is a card

1072
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,854
game, you deal cards out to people, they look at who they are and they go, I am this person

1073
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:44,374
on this team.

1074
01:00:44,694 --> 01:00:48,497
If they're partially sighted or they cannot see at all, it's exactly the same for them

1075
01:00:48,577 --> 01:00:51,799
if they feel the role that they are, they can enjoy the game like other people.

1076
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:56,643
I think some of these problems can be solved if we're just a bit more inventive, maybe.

1077
01:00:57,768 --> 01:00:59,250
I think we're pretty much out of time, aren't we?

1078
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,891
Thank you all very much for coming.

1079
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:04,594
Consider idly, please, in some spare moment

1080
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:08,118
what it is that you think you can do to make gaming better,

1081
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:10,300
and I'm addressing some of you more than others.

1082
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,361
We got attacked a little bit online

1083
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:15,044
for talking about this last year at this panel.

1084
01:01:15,424 --> 01:01:16,805
Probably get attacked online again,

1085
01:01:17,126 --> 01:01:19,688
and it will probably keep happening until we win.

1086
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:20,909
Thank you, everyone.
