1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,473
Okay, welcome to Don't Be a Copycat, personalized marketing for your game.

2
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:20,176
My name is Derek Liu, and I'll be doing this talk with my friend Dana Trebella.

3
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:24,159
But let me tell first tell me if this sounds familiar.

4
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:44,939
You need to market your game, but you're really, really overwhelmed because there's just so many tools and apps and talks and videos and articles saying do this and do this. So you're thinking to yourself, okay, I guess I'll just do all the things or maybe I'll do what that game did, because it looked like they had success.

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,160
But

6
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:52,680
really, you don't really know how or why you should be doing any of these things. So we're here to

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,303
help you market your game with goals and intentions, so then that you can find what works best for you

8
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:03,506
because there's so many ways that you can market your game. But first, a little bit about Dana.

9
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:08,649
Hey, I'm Dana Chabela. I'm the founder of Spoken Meals Strategy,

10
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:12,411
where I do PR, marketing and brand strategy for games.

11
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,551
I've been running Spoken Meals Strategy for the last six and a half years,

12
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,954
but have been doing marketing for PR and games since 2012.

13
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:24,599
I've worked on tons of different games, all different sizes, all different

14
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:28,022
platforms, and these are just a small sample of

15
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:30,905
some of the games that I've worked on that you've heard of.

16
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,628
All right, and as I said, my name is Derek Liu.

17
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,149
I'm a video game trailer editor.

18
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,752
I've been doing it for full time, about five years,

19
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:40,835
but I've been editing video for about 15 years.

20
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,198
And here's a small sample of some games that I've worked on.

21
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,180
I've worked on games with really small teams

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,082
and games with much bigger teams.

23
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:51,845
And I know, and yeah.

24
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:56,485
All right, so as I was saying,

25
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,726
there are so many ways to market your games.

26
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:00,526
There's your Steam store page,

27
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:03,707
there's Imgur, newsletters, mailing lists,

28
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:08,288
Discord, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter.

29
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:12,929
And the first step to really start marketing your game

30
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:14,570
is to just know what are the tools

31
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,570
that you have at your disposal potentially.

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,851
And the second is to understand

33
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:20,491
what your marketing goals are.

34
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:21,051
And the-

35
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:27,399
Third is to choose which tactics to use in order to fulfill those goals.

36
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,261
Because especially if you're indie, you have to be really efficient

37
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,221
with your time and your money.

38
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:35,164
You can't really afford to just try everything, do everything at the same

39
00:02:35,244 --> 00:02:38,486
time and just sort of stretch yourself thin and potentially just

40
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,407
not do any of it very well.

41
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:45,950
So next up, Dana is going to talk about the goals you should be aiming for

42
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,451
when it comes to marketing your game.

43
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,951
Great, so as Derek mentioned, we're going to talk about goals.

44
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,892
So ultimately, everyone should have their own personalized goals for

45
00:02:56,912 --> 00:03:01,493
their game, depending on the team, the size of the game, and

46
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:03,394
lots of other external factors.

47
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:05,675
But one thing that I always hear over and

48
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:09,976
over when I ask people about their goals is that they're always just hyper

49
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:10,936
focused on sales.

50
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,898
And obviously sales is a part of it, it's really important.

51
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:18,301
But there's lots of other goals that you can have beyond just how many copies you

52
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:22,604
sell. So things like, do you want to find a publisher or build a community or

53
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:24,605
just learn how marketing works?

54
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:28,888
Here though, we're going to walk through some goals that everyone should probably

55
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:32,251
have for their marketing, regardless of your own personalized goals.

56
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:36,195
So first, you want to make your game stand out.

57
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,256
So you want to make it look and sound different

58
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:39,557
from everything else out there.

59
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:41,518
And also remember to differentiate

60
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:43,919
within your own genre.

61
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:47,901
So if your game marketing makes your game look or sound

62
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:49,382
the same as everything else, you're

63
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,203
probably wasting your time and your money and your efforts.

64
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,244
So it's really important to showcase your game's strengths

65
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,826
in a way that's digestible and accessible

66
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:01,808
and also will resonate with your desired target audience.

67
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,527
So next, you want to provide a means to easily find and share

68
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:08,429
and follow your game.

69
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,475
So we all know that attention span is pretty short,

70
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:13,418
and you risk losing players.

71
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,262
but they don't have an easy way to follow you

72
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:19,265
or get some kind of regular reminder

73
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,546
that your game exists.

74
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,949
So it's also important to remember

75
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:25,011
that people want to tell others

76
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,293
about the things that they've seen

77
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,355
or they played or that they're really excited about.

78
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:31,038
And the easier that it is to share something,

79
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:33,721
the more likely and more often that it'll get shared.

80
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:40,981
And then lastly, your game should always end with a call to action, or your marketing should always end with a call to action,

81
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:44,802
which ultimately removes friction for the player to do what you want.

82
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:46,783
You want to make it as easy as possible.

83
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:53,206
So, for example, on the end slate of a trailer, you should probably always have things like wishlist now,

84
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:59,608
or your Twitter handle, or website, or things like that.

85
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:06,034
So next you want to provide the media, so that's press, YouTubers, and streamers,

86
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:11,660
information that's easy to digest and find so that they can write stories and produce content.

87
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:17,827
So media want to create stories and streams, etc., on things that their audience would be

88
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:22,112
really interested in, but in order to do that, the information needs to be easy to

89
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:25,575
find and tell a clear and consistent message.

90
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,177
So just like anyone else, media and streamers

91
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,119
love it when you make their job easy for them

92
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:34,961
and easily summarize the information

93
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,703
and remove friction to make everything easy to find

94
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:40,085
and access like screenshots, trailers,

95
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,407
your game description, et cetera.

96
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:48,856
So you also want to inform the customer so that they can make a decision and

97
00:05:48,876 --> 00:05:50,177
be motivated to purchase.

98
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:53,718
It's really important to remember that marketing is not about tricking people.

99
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,181
It's about informing them so they can decide if it's of interest to them and

100
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,082
they can make a decision for themselves.

101
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:04,684
So at a basic level, you want people to know things like what consoles or

102
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:09,327
platforms, what genre, how much does it cost, what's the play through time, etc.

103
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:14,648
And then we're going to be talking a lot about this today,

104
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,675
but you want to understand the intention of each marketing

105
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,259
component to decide what makes sense for your game.

106
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:27,528
So kind of like Derek talked about early on, we both see people just doing things a lot of the

107
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:32,172
time because they don't know what to do or they think they should do certain things or saw that

108
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:38,837
it worked for somebody else and are sort of just like aimlessly roaming around the marketing bubble.

109
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:43,421
But it's really important to know the why behind every marketing strategy,

110
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:47,805
tactic, and choice that you make and that you're making choices based on.

111
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:51,852
all of the goals that we just talked about, and also your personalized goals,

112
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:56,641
and the type of game that you're making, the audience it's for, and the resources that you have.

113
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:58,003
So...

114
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:06,289
Now that we've said repeatedly, don't just do something because someone said that you should do this.

115
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,611
Here we're going to walk through all the things that you should probably do in order to market your game.

116
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:16,632
So you've probably heard of all of these marketing components to some degree,

117
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:20,853
but we're going to walk through what the intention or purpose should be behind each of these.

118
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,032
as well as the workload, the upkeep, and the importance,

119
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,734
which you'll see we've denoted on each of the slides.

120
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,676
So you can keep those in mind

121
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:31,657
while making your own marketing plans.

122
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:38,122
So first, your message, which is a cohesive, consistent,

123
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:40,404
and compelling way to talk about your game.

124
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:44,616
In its most basic form, it's your elevator pitch.

125
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:49,621
But it really should be based off of what makes your game special or different from everything else out there

126
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:51,642
and inform all of your marketing.

127
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:57,467
Little self-plug, Derek and I actually did a talk at GBC 2019

128
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:02,832
all about creating a message for your game and how to enact that in your marketing and your trailers,

129
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,213
if you feel like checking them out.

130
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:12,575
So the intention behind your message should be ultimately you're going to use words to communicate

131
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:18,219
what your game is, what makes it different, and hopefully makes people interested in learning

132
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:23,843
more about your game and want to follow it and share it and ultimately hopefully they buy it.

133
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:30,147
What I also always say to people is like if you don't have a message like

134
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:35,578
what are you saying? And it's really easy to tell when someone doesn't because that's when you often

135
00:08:35,618 --> 00:08:42,500
see things like the screenshots not actually reflecting what the game is or like the trailer

136
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,642
feeling really disjointed or things like that. So you can see here, like I mentioned earlier,

137
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:53,584
we've denoted how much work and importance and upkeep everything requires. So your message is

138
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:57,486
a fair amount of work. It's really important. And once you have it,

139
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:58,968
it's pretty much done.

140
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,450
Like you should definitely make sure that you're testing it

141
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,551
and getting feedback on it,

142
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:05,713
but not something that you need to consistently workshop

143
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:06,674
throughout your marketing.

144
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,377
So here's a couple of quick examples

145
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,439
of some clear and compelling messages.

146
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,881
So things like time moves when you move

147
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,762
or it's a lovely morning in the village

148
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,143
and you're a horrible goose.

149
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,936
So a couple quick tips, you wanna make it clear,

150
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,397
concise and accessible.

151
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,138
You wanna convey what the game is

152
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,379
and the player experience really quickly.

153
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,820
You wanna leave people wanting more.

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,221
So you wanna kind of tease it and not say

155
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,341
or say everything all at once.

156
00:09:36,862 --> 00:09:40,903
And then also you wanna steer clear from common traps

157
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:44,485
of relying only on genre or comparing your game with others

158
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,166
or doing things like my game is a mix of,

159
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,687
you know, X and Y had a baby.

160
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,111
So marketing timeline is exactly what it sounds like.

161
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,432
A clear framework of your game's marketing timeline

162
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:57,752
from your announcement to launch.

163
00:09:57,832 --> 00:10:00,312
And it's also a thing that almost everybody skips.

164
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:04,253
So your intention, if you do this correctly,

165
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:07,814
is that it provides you a framework

166
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,935
and an understanding of what assets you'll need and when

167
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,456
throughout your entire public-facing marketing process

168
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:16,136
so that you can be more prepared

169
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,557
and hopefully also be less stressed.

170
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,173
Um, it also is important to note this is internal.

171
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,314
Nobody ever used to see this or know that it exists.

172
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:31,055
And then a few quick tips here, most importantly is to start with your

173
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:34,116
realistic launch timeframe and work backwards.

174
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:40,197
So, um, for example, you want to, if you're going to launch in, you know,

175
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:45,498
six months, you want to announce your game, uh, like.

176
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,461
Let me let me start that over.

177
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,402
Uh, okay.

178
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:53,485
So most importantly, you want to start with your realistic launch time frame and

179
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,447
work backwards to determine your marketing needs.

180
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:59,971
So what that means is it's really important to be honest with yourself about your time

181
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,073
and your resources and your launch timeline.

182
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:07,757
So if you, um, plan an entire marketing campaign with a six months, uh, like

183
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:11,761
launch timeframe, but it's actually going to be a year, then you're only hurting

184
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,201
yourself.

185
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:12,562
So it's really.

186
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:16,734
that as accurately as you can.

187
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:21,776
So you want to work backwards from your launch date

188
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,356
to your first time that you announced your game.

189
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,437
And that ultimately is the timeline that you have to fill

190
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,118
with fun marketing things.

191
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,298
And then it's also really important to think

192
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,358
about the spacing between your marketing beats.

193
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,299
Again, keeping in mind how long your overall timeline is

194
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:39,940
and think through

195
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,692
think it through so that you're not putting too much into a condensed

196
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,515
timeframe or like taking too much space between them.

197
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:50,737
So press kit,

198
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:54,840
this is just an easy to download package of assets to help the media write about

199
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,642
your game. A super straightforward.

200
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:02,046
It makes it easier for press to cover your game. Um, and, uh,

201
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,208
you want to make sure that you're providing.

202
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:10,819
not an overwhelming amount of information because that can feel like daunting to people and prohibit

203
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:15,563
them from covering. So you want to do things like five to seven screenshots, put your trailer,

204
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:20,387
your pricing information, information about the game, and it should all be in one very easy to

205
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:28,913
download and one concise place. So your press list. This is a list of journalists, YouTubers,

206
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:32,296
streamers, etc. who are most likely to be interested in your game.

207
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:38,450
The intention is you want to keep track of this targeted media who are more

208
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:42,859
more likely to cover your game because they're specifically interested in

209
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,102
the type of game that you're making.

210
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:54,188
So a couple of quick tips here is that you want to research folks who have covered or streamed

211
00:12:55,148 --> 00:13:01,030
games who are similar to yours. So that might be similar games in your genre or competitors. And

212
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,332
you want to look at those similar games or competitors within the last like year or two.

213
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:11,935
Going too far back is often outdated information. And you want to make sure your press list contains

214
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:16,196
everybody's contact information so you can easily outreach to them.

215
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,624
And you can often find the contact information through the media outlet themselves.

216
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:25,409
And many of them have consistent formats that they use, so it's actually really easy to

217
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,180
to find all of them.

218
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,342
You also wanna make sure you update it consistently

219
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,764
and that you keep thorough notes.

220
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:37,707
So update it consistently because journalists in particular

221
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:40,909
move around a lot and you wanna keep notes

222
00:13:41,349 --> 00:13:44,531
of like why someone might be interested in your game,

223
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,673
if someone responded previously or previously covered

224
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:50,675
or made a comment to you about like the art

225
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:51,736
or something in your game,

226
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:53,217
you wanna make sure that you have that

227
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,779
so that you can be really personalized in your approach.

228
00:13:56,694 --> 00:14:00,057
which brings me to your press emails.

229
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:05,042
So the intention here is to get press or streaming coverage

230
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:07,344
in accordance with your marketing beat.

231
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:11,668
Marketing beat being like, is it an announcement of your game?

232
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:14,091
Is it your launch trailer, etc.

233
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:19,750
So again, you want to make sure that you've researched the people that you're conducting outreach to,

234
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,152
so that it can be really personalized in your approach.

235
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:27,535
You do not want to just send a mass email. Nobody likes that. It doesn't feel good.

236
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:33,178
And you want to include easy links to your trailer, your press kit, and your store page,

237
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:36,921
because again, we're removing friction to make things as easy as possible.

238
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:42,084
So now Derek is going to carry on with the rest of the essentials.

239
00:14:43,202 --> 00:14:47,263
Alright, so next up is Twitter. Twitter is unique in that it's

240
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:50,223
just a really low commitment way for people to follow you,

241
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:53,124
which counterpoint to that is that when you have links on

242
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:56,085
Twitter, they generally don't really convert very well. But

243
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:01,506
it's just a good way to just have a good way to communicate

244
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:05,767
with other people about your game, whether that is press or

245
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:09,468
curators, investors, scouts, a lot of professionals and

246
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,368
developers are on Twitter. I mean, of course, potential

247
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:12,988
players, but

248
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:17,933
it's kind of more of a place for connecting with people within the industry who will then

249
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:24,920
sort of broadcast your game out even further. And also you can use it to show development,

250
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,826
share screenshots, and GIFs. A really good GIF on Twitter can get a lot of retweets potentially,

251
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:34,210
so it is one place that you probably want to be.

252
00:15:35,259 --> 00:16:00,665
And so the workload and the upkeep, they're kind of on the high end because Twitter is one of those things where if you don't use it a lot, it looks like the account is dead. And it just, you have to just be fairly active on there. So then that people know that it's actually worth following. But as far as like discovery and stuff is not the most important thing, but you can use it to perform, create a lot of professional relationships.

253
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,802
Alright, next up is your announced trailer. Of course, you have to let

254
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:09,763
people know your game exists, hopefully you do it with a really good

255
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:15,025
announced trailer. To announce the game, spark interest, hopefully get a

256
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:19,107
lot of wish lists and media coverage and also start building a following.

257
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:23,309
Trailers are a lot of work, and they're very, very important. But once

258
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,010
it's done, it's done. So you don't really have to worry about any sort of

259
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,450
upkeep.

260
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,090
And then next is your launch trailer.

261
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,271
So I only have in the essentials two trailers

262
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:34,712
because at the bare minimum,

263
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,073
you have to announce the game exists

264
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:37,695
and then announce when it came out.

265
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,437
Everything else I think is pretty much extra,

266
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:41,598
but it depends on the game.

267
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:44,640
But yeah, the launch trailer is there to announce

268
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,701
that the game is out, where you can buy it

269
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:48,523
and motivate people to buy it

270
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,504
and maybe tie up some lingering questions

271
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,105
about gameplay or the story

272
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,407
and get people really hyped, hopefully.

273
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,989
Again, lots of work, not a lot of upkeep,

274
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,650
but very important.

275
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:21,231
Next up are screenshots, which I mean screenshots just another way to show what the game looks like, but they're sort of more immediate than trailers because images you can just have on social media posts or maybe it from your press press kit provide images that can be used in articles, maybe use them to show what the game's UI looks like or sort of the genre space.

276
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:23,492
And you know just just make the other.

277
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:28,960
things about your game look very pretty. Not as much work as a trailer, and there is a little

278
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,865
bit of upkeep because you want to make sure your screenshots are up to date. You don't want to

279
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,232
release your game and have all the articles show really old screenshots,

280
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:41,097
which has definitely happened before, and they're very important as well.

281
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:47,825
especially for your store page. Because your store page is there to provide sort of information

282
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:53,589
about the genre space and the sort of the content and the features of the game. And of course,

283
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:57,831
make it look very appealing, hopefully with a really good trailer and good screenshots. And

284
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:01,634
it's there to just motivate people to buy maybe wishlisted if they're not quite.

285
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,156
committee yet or it's just not out yet.

286
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:07,679
And your store page, you know, not a ton of work.

287
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:10,241
I mean, it takes a fair amount of work to make it look good.

288
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,603
And you need to do a little bit of upkeep every now and then

289
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,984
so that it looks kind of active,

290
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:16,846
but it is very, very important

291
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:19,307
for it to have a really good store page

292
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,189
with all this stuff in one place.

293
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:25,955
And then related are the store metadata tags.

294
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,757
This is especially for Steam,

295
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,460
because if you don't have really good tags

296
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,062
for your game on Steam,

297
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,825
not only do people not quite know what genre it is,

298
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,427
but Steam itself actually will have difficulty

299
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,409
sorting your game into the store.

300
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,412
And what you want is to have really good tags

301
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:43,393
according to your genre.

302
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:50,018
like the vibe and tone of your game. So then that other similar games might recommend yours like on

303
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,083
the bottom of that page. And because I mean a lot of your customers, especially in a bigger genre,

304
00:18:56,463 --> 00:19:01,087
will probably be more people who have played games very similar to yours. So you want to

305
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:05,670
make sure Steam knows how to categorize your game. And you know on the grand scheme of things,

306
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:11,574
not a lot of work. And I think pretty much you can set it and forget it once you've set those up.

307
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:17,878
also very important. Okay, so next are some nice to haves. Now

308
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:21,082
a lot of these, I would still say are pretty important, but

309
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:24,186
you know, they're not like the super core part of the

310
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:28,330
marketing. So you will not die if you don't have them. But some

311
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,853
of these can still be very effective if you have the time

312
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,395
and resources to do them well.

313
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:36,800
First up is a mailing list or newsletter,

314
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,741
whatever you want to call it.

315
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:41,125
This is just a way to just communicate very consistently

316
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,927
with the people who show the most interest in your game.

317
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:45,609
And you know they have the most interest

318
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,891
because they gave you their email address

319
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:52,456
as opposed to just following you on Twitter.

320
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:54,298
Because people will give you their email address.

321
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:59,780
means that they're really interested and want to get all the nice juicy details.

322
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,441
And really the other intention is just cultivate a long-term engaged audience,

323
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:08,023
either just for your game or your studio and then future games, potentially,

324
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,844
if you release more than one. And the workload can vary depending on how much you want to update

325
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:18,186
or send out newsletter articles. So it can be more or less...

326
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:22,672
based off if you sent out a newsletter like once a month or once a week.

327
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:28,096
So it can be a decent amount of upkeep because people, you want them to have a reason to actually

328
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:34,822
be subscribed. You don't want just to use it as like a, hey the game's out, buy it. You need to

329
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:35,762
give something to them.

330
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:39,425
So yeah, in the long run, mailing lists can be very important.

331
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:45,450
And one good example of mailing lists I've seen that's, I think, done very well is this one for

332
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:54,558
Kit Fox Games' game Boyfriend Dungeon. What they did was each article that they send out is sent

333
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:58,521
as if it's a letter from one of the love interests from the game. So in this case, it was a cat.

334
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:04,589
And sort of down below this section, they had parts, like updates about the game and some cases

335
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,615
about the studio themselves. So there are ways you can personalize it and make it more fun.

336
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:15,201
animated GIFs. And I guess can be really, really effective at

337
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,043
marketing your game, especially if your game is the store that

338
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:21,925
can be summed up in a GIF, which that's not all games. But if it

339
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:25,467
can, then you really should be making animated GIFs to make

340
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:29,049
your social media posts a lot prettier, and potentially

341
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,211
getting a lot of attention. Like I said, if it goes like viral,

342
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:35,994
because this one GIF from your game really took off, and it,

343
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:38,275
you know, could just be something that like a glitch

344
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:39,896
that happened your game that was really funny, but

345
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,958
animated GIFs can be really good.

346
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,201
And they're kind of more work to make

347
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:51,545
just because there's a whole process to like take video

348
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,327
and then capture it and turn it into a GIF.

349
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:56,328
And just like screenshots,

350
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:58,910
you want to sort of keep them up to date,

351
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,333
but they can be very important also for your store page.

352
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:05,404
Next up, gameplay and story trailers.

353
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:08,046
Yeah, these are just to sort of flesh out

354
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,948
either the gameplay or the narrative of the game,

355
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:13,270
depending on what sort of game that you're making,

356
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,992
because some games, it's all about the gameplay,

357
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,294
some it's mostly about the story and the gameplay

358
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:22,177
is not really worth expanding upon in like one full trailer.

359
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:25,200
Again, lots of work, pretty darn important

360
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,802
if your game really needs that sort of extra

361
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:32,326
little bit of video to help people understand what it is.

362
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,573
But once it's done, it's done and will serve you

363
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,614
for discovery purposes.

364
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,596
And then next is TikTok.

365
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:43,558
As of this talk, kind of the new hotness.

366
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,822
TikTok is just a good way to show quick looks at your game

367
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:52,044
or sort of like small snippets about your game.

368
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:54,806
And you can use it to broadcast announcements

369
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:59,190
and potentially gather lots and lots of eyeballs from players

370
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,051
and also get wish lists that way.

371
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:05,394
It's a decent amount of work because it is video and editing.

372
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:10,197
And you want to be decently active so then that TikTok will want to promote your videos more.

373
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:17,923
But TikTok is just really good because each video the way the algorithm works has a potential to be seen by lots and lots of people.

374
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,565
So the first we put out one video gets shown to a bunch of random people.

375
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:27,409
If it does well, gets shown to even more random people and then it goes on and on as opposed to some places like.

376
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,355
you know, YouTube or Twitter, which it's more dependent on who is actually following you.

377
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:38,920
There's its lower chance of getting discovered sort of randomly on a lot of other platforms,

378
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,845
as opposed to TikTok. And then there's your website. Your website is just one place to

379
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:49,189
house all the game's information and make it look really pretty. Especially good.

380
00:23:50,943 --> 00:23:52,944
if you're launching on multiple platforms.

381
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,127
But really it's kind of more to present the game

382
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:58,228
to like investors, publishers and press,

383
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:00,069
not as much for players,

384
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:03,232
because really you want the players to get to the store page

385
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,613
after they see like an article or their trailer.

386
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,054
You don't really want them to go to the website

387
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:10,317
because it's kind of adding extra clicks

388
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:12,318
between the discovery of the game

389
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:14,199
and wishlisting or buying it.

390
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,981
So I'd say, we're saying it's not really

391
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,182
for every sort of game.

392
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:24,677
a huge priority. It really depends again on your goals and if your goals are to like get it seen by

393
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:31,281
like a publisher or people who might help fund your game. But again website can be a lot of work

394
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:36,645
and it also can be upkeep because it has things that can go out of date like screenshots and trailers.

395
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:38,125
Okay.

396
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,976
And then next up is Discord. The intention of Discord is to build a community. It's like a long-term goal.

397
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:49,440
And to just communicate with like really the most dedicated fans.

398
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:53,604
This one we're saying it's really not as important, especially if you're new.

399
00:24:54,644 --> 00:25:00,367
especially because it's also just a lot of work and a lot of upkeep because just the real time nature of it.

400
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:05,849
You want to be pretty active in there so then that people have a reason to follow it.

401
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,952
Whereas if you know everyone joins your discord, but then finds out you never use it, then why would they stay?

402
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,233
But again, it can be so much work.

403
00:25:14,153 --> 00:25:17,055
So we're putting this on the lower end of importance.

404
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:19,886
And then next are online events.

405
00:25:21,007 --> 00:25:24,449
You know, E3, as I was talking, E3 just happened pretty recently.

406
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,671
So a lot of online events and showcases where people could see games.

407
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:32,534
This is a way to potentially get a lot of eyeballs on your game and gather wishlists.

408
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,676
Maybe like during the Steam Festival, you share a demo for your game.

409
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:39,398
And it can be a lot of work because you have to get like a trailer ready

410
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,280
or maybe a demo version of the game ready.

411
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:47,040
but it can be quite effective at getting your game out there,

412
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,383
which is similar to conventions, which currently there aren't

413
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:53,686
any conventions going on, but conventions are similar.

414
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:57,410
But actually, you can't actually show as many people

415
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,912
your game at a convention, because just

416
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:01,774
the physical space and the number of people

417
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,676
who show up at a convention.

418
00:26:04,136 --> 00:26:06,459
But you can use it to connect with media,

419
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,900
maybe build up your mailing list.

420
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,082
do some in-person user testing, but conventions are just a lot of work and a lot of money.

421
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:19,023
So on the grand scheme of things, we're saying this is not quite as important as some of the

422
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:25,204
other essentials we cited. So now Dana is going to help us figure out how to choose

423
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:29,525
the different strategies for your particular game. Just some tips here.

424
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:35,549
Now we've gone through a ton of possibilities that you can do and probably overwhelmed you

425
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,837
with all of the options, but this is called personalized marketing. So

426
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,262
how do you choose what actually makes sense for your game?

427
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,004
So the best case scenario is to use multiple tactics

428
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:50,845
and strategies.

429
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:54,849
So to mix and match some of the essential items

430
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:58,533
and also some of the nice to have items.

431
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:01,576
But it doesn't mean that you have to do everything.

432
00:27:02,216 --> 00:27:08,282
It's better to do some things really well than to try and do all of the things and kind

433
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,163
of like half-assed do them.

434
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:16,089
So we're going to talk through some potential ways that you can figure out what makes sense

435
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:16,429
for you.

436
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:19,512
So first, here's one way to break it down.

437
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,714
So look at the following factors for you.

438
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:23,956
So resources.

439
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:29,060
What does your team realistically have time and money to do well?

440
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:35,014
skills. What do you guys have the ability to do well in-house and what does your team lack the

441
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:40,203
ability to do that you might need to outsource and do you have the budget for that? And also,

442
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,148
where do you think you could get the most impact for the least effort?

443
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,750
because that is great.

444
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,271
And then your community.

445
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:49,733
So what tends to resonate with your community

446
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:50,994
if you already have one?

447
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:54,316
I think it's also really important to think through,

448
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:57,118
like, you know, maybe your studio has a community

449
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,919
already built in from other games that you have,

450
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,461
or maybe you're starting from ground zero,

451
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:03,842
and that makes a difference too.

452
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,644
The great thing about social media though,

453
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:08,065
is that you can get analytics,

454
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:11,848
which will help you figure out what works well

455
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:13,269
and what tends to resonate.

456
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,892
Maybe your community responds really well

457
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:18,694
to animated GIFs or something like that.

458
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:20,815
And so you know that you should be making more of those.

459
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:23,277
And then again, going back to the goals

460
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,338
that we talked about earlier.

461
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,420
So some of your personalized goals here.

462
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,742
So things like, are you trying to get a publisher

463
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:32,265
or get featured by a store page or build that community?

464
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:33,766
Because all of those change.

465
00:28:35,218 --> 00:28:40,742
types of strategies and tactics that make sense for your day. So here's

466
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:46,305
another way to potentially break it down. So you can look at, like just list out

467
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:51,749
all of the different tactics that we talked through and then rank them. So we

468
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:56,111
have them ranked by the impact, so what do you expect the impact of doing the

469
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,954
thing to be, and also how doable is it for you.

470
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:07,484
So, you know, for example, we've got discord here, which probably relatively low impact.

471
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:13,085
If you've got a community manager or something, it might be more doable or less doable,

472
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:14,906
but it requires a lot of upkeep.

473
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:20,127
And you can do that for every single thing, add up all the totals, and then kind of see,

474
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:23,108
like, what has the highest score.

475
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:29,229
And that's like a very non-scientific but potential way to figure out what would work for you.

476
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:46,545
Another way to do it is to look at upkeep. So we've gone through all the previous slides and given everything an upkeep rating. So we've divided all of the things that we talked through, or at least most of the things that we've talked through into upkeep.

477
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:51,176
categories, meaning that they require the amount of work

478
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:53,017
that they require on an ongoing basis.

479
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:56,199
So looking at these, you might want

480
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:59,161
to choose more things from the low to medium category

481
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,323
and maybe one thing from the high category,

482
00:30:01,983 --> 00:30:04,105
and only choose something from the highest category

483
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,407
if you guys have the resources to do it,

484
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,108
like we talked about earlier.

485
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,730
Because you don't want to end up getting stuck.

486
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:17,462
worry only because that will feel very overwhelming.

487
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,312
So another way to potentially do this.

488
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:30,705
We've divided all of the tactics into four various categories of like marketing goals,

489
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:36,570
we'll say. So one being discoverability, one being make your game look cool, another being talk to

490
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,735
people about your game, and build community. So we've taken all of that and thrown them into

491
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:44,818
which category we think that they best fit into.

492
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:59,025
And so, like, if you're struggling with what to do, one thing you could do is just pick one or two from each category, and then at least you know that you've got your bases covered, at least somewhat.

493
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:04,096
So it's also important to note that on the last slide,

494
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:07,938
we categorized everything into just one bucket.

495
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,580
But a lot of things overlap or accomplish multiple goals.

496
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,002
And so this is a list of the tactics,

497
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:20,244
but also you can look at like how many

498
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:22,905
of the different goals those tactics help you accomplish.

499
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:25,766
So you can see something like messaging reaches

500
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:28,828
across all four, something like,

501
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:33,085
you know, Facebook might only do one or two.

502
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:37,969
And so looking at how many different touch points you're

503
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,712
getting there could be another way to decide what makes sense

504
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:41,293
for your game.

505
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,137
Now, Derek is going to kind of wrap up and summarize what we've

506
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:46,618
talked about.

507
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,098
All right, so to sum things up a little bit,

508
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,143
first, remove the word should from your marketing vocabulary.

509
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,786
I know we threw some shoulds in this talk here,

510
00:31:56,866 --> 00:32:00,911
but really, before you just follow up

511
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,174
on hearing someone say you should do something,

512
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:05,877
think about like, okay, how will that work for your game?

513
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:08,318
what is the intention behind that thing?

514
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:11,198
Try not to think, OK, someone else did that,

515
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,279
so I should do that.

516
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,759
Just stop yourself there when you have that sort of thought.

517
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,140
Think about, OK, why?

518
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,200
And will that help your game in particular?

519
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,761
And then you'll hopefully be more successful.

520
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:24,642
And then as we were saying, start with just one thing

521
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:26,103
and branch out when you're able.

522
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:27,703
This especially goes for

523
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:34,681
like social media platforms, like if you decide you want to do YouTube or Twitch or TikTok,

524
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:40,704
start with just one thing and try to get good at that and find success there. Because if you try

525
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:44,687
three things, especially if they're very labor intensive, then it doesn't get as much attention

526
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,689
and you probably will not have as much success. And then if you're finding that it's working,

527
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:54,172
then at that point, it might be good to start adding on different social media accounts or

528
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:57,795
something like that. So then that you can potentially get that audience.

529
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,232
And then also just experiment and pivot as much as you can,

530
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:04,633
because I mean, failure during the process

531
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:07,095
is much better than failing at launch.

532
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,076
And a good thing about being indie especially

533
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:13,438
is that if you do some sort of marketing thing

534
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,439
and it doesn't really land, it's okay.

535
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,381
You can just delete it and then try something new.

536
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:22,043
Or if you find out you did something that got a success

537
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,004
and you didn't expect it,

538
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:25,425
then you could just pursue that angle.

539
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:33,499
And also remember some games do better on different platforms and you might not know what platform is best for your game when you start out.

540
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,164
So experiment and pivot.

541
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:38,938
And then also while you're doing this,

542
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:41,260
just think about like what would give your audience joy?

543
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,561
Because especially with games,

544
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:43,921
they take a long time to come out.

545
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,403
So you really need to give people a reason

546
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,184
to follow you on these different places.

547
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:51,927
And one way to think about how you can entertain them

548
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,168
in the meantime is to think about,

549
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,229
okay, what would this audience enjoy?

550
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:57,631
Either because they like a similar genre

551
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,552
or there's certain part of my arts

552
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:00,733
or some other part of your game

553
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:01,914
that they would enjoy seeing.

554
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:07,936
So think about that and try to learn from your audience based off of what gets success or what

555
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:13,877
they're just saying to you and try to make it fun before the game even comes out. And again,

556
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:18,478
you're not trying to trick people into buying your game. You're trying to inform people,

557
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:23,860
help them make a decision, show how you're unique and also find the audience that will

558
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,101
resonate most with your game. And being transparent is really a good...

559
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:33,831
way of doing this, people respect transparency. And you know, they don't

560
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,433
feel good when they then they get something that it wasn't what they

561
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:41,457
expected. So just be transparent, be honest, and help people figure out what

562
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:44,560
your game is. And also, if you help them figure out that their game that your

563
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,923
game isn't for them, that's still fine, because there's no such thing as one

564
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:51,566
game that works for every single person. And you just need to find the right

565
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,407
people who will enjoy your game.

566
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,861
And this is all again, to personalize the marketing,

567
00:34:57,341 --> 00:35:00,041
you know, show who you are and what your game is

568
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:00,962
through your marketing.

569
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:03,862
Don't copy other people because even if the game's similar

570
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:05,363
to yours, it's still not your game.

571
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:07,503
You know, make it personal.

572
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:09,403
Don't make it stale and corporate.

573
00:35:09,463 --> 00:35:12,424
Just try to find the voice of your game and its marketing.

574
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:15,124
And thank you for listening.
