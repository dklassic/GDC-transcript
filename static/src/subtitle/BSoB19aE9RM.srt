1
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:18,991
All right, so Bill and I are both engaged in a fairly large project to try to develop new approaches for reusable, sort of a cross scenario and a cross character social behavior.

2
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:22,495
So the first thing is, what do we mean by social behavior?

3
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,658
And what we mean by social behavior...

4
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:28,180
is the kind of behavior that we found in Facade,

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,002
where the characters are engaged in activity

6
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:35,064
which is primarily about modifying

7
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:38,466
the social state. They're not

8
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,528
necessarily worrying about, you know, in this case,

9
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:45,070
weapon combos or combat behavior or navigation.

10
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:50,637
but really about doing things that express rich social state change.

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:54,201
Like, you know, I don't like you, but I'm hiding I don't like you,

12
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:56,643
and I'm trying to ally with this person over here.

13
00:00:56,964 --> 00:01:03,391
This is the kind of behavior that we really want to make radically reusable across characters.

14
00:01:04,473 --> 00:01:08,097
So the vision we have is reusable social behavior.

15
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,920
Reusable means it's applicable to multiple characters

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,923
in multiple game worlds, that it's easily

17
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:16,766
overwritable for custom content.

18
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:19,629
So the idea would be that you've got a big library

19
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:20,470
of social behaviors.

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,792
You can sort of drop them quickly on characters

21
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,114
and sort of get to this 80% point.

22
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,956
in say a particular social situation you're creating

23
00:01:29,197 --> 00:01:32,718
and in that 20 percent there's a nice kind of layered system

24
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,499
for going in and doing overrides and inserts.

25
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:39,860
It should be highly mixable. Combinatorial behavior blends

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,961
and behavior contracting where one behavior kind of

27
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:43,762
will

28
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:47,123
tell another behavior to do something for it in its service,

29
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:50,646
but somewhat generative to avoid combinatorial authoring.

30
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:52,247
If we have combinatorial blends, but you

31
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:55,328
have to author how everything combines with everything,

32
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:57,950
well, then you're just back to this giant authoring problem.

33
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,491
We want it to be real time, where behaviors play out

34
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,112
continuously and are continuously

35
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,373
reactive to player input.

36
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:04,834
And we want it to be symmetric.

37
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:10,876
that every role in a particular social behavior can be performed by an NPC or a player,

38
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,277
that they can all perform and respond to the same actions.

39
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:18,719
So if we score a facade in this case, well, real-time it was doing okay.

40
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,700
There's continuous performance and it's fairly interruptible.

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,982
You know, there's never really, you know, kind of in-engine cutscene-like activity

42
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,643
where they're sort of blabbing on for a long time or performing some action

43
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,824
and you can't interrupt them.

44
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:36,446
pretty continuously interruptible and they're performing all the time. They never just stop and

45
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:42,370
go into, you know, kind of a Perlin noise loop to establish their liveness while they wait for the

46
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,813
next thing. They're moderately mixable. So, for example, you know, the characters can make drinks

47
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:53,015
while arguing about any topic. There's an eight ball gag that can sort of mix in anywhere on top

48
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:57,658
of things. There's a lot of complicated staging that's going on that can mix in on top of any

49
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:58,378
argument behavior.

50
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,462
So, fair amount of mixing. I'd like them to be even more mixable.

51
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,704
Complete fail on reusable and symmetric.

52
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:08,289
The majority of the behaviors are very specific to Trip and Grace in this scenario.

53
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,313
So even if you wanted to make another story about Trip and Grace,

54
00:03:12,553 --> 00:03:14,796
there would be a bunch more behavior authoring you'd have to do.

55
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:18,758
And if you were trying to make a sort of AI-based interactive

56
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,279
story about completely different characters,

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,921
well, you're going to have to almost start from scratch.

58
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:27,403
So not reusable and not symmetric.

59
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,884
Trip and Grace can do a lot of things with each other,

60
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,766
like be snarky and understand they're being snarky

61
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,427
and respond to the snark that the player can't do.

62
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:38,989
The player can't sort of say something in a snarky way

63
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,530
and know that they'll get the snark.

64
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:47,872
And there's a lot of cases like that where the characters are engaging in sort of richer social interaction with each other

65
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:54,499
than the player can with them. So in Prom Week, which we talked about a couple of years ago here,

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,305
our goal was to say, well, can we push reusability at the dialogue level?

67
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:08,332
We wanted to have a larger cast of characters where we could generally write social exchanges between characters

68
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:14,898
and have those social exchanges automatically re-target onto specific characters in specific social contexts.

69
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,924
So social behaviors in prom week were more reusable.

70
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:25,386
We could dynamically retarget dialogue within a scenario,

71
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,188
but had very little physical behavior.

72
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,570
Effectively, kind of dialogue exchanges were sort of

73
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,972
illustrated by tagged animations that went with them.

74
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,615
So I guess you could call that sort of physical behavior

75
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:36,896
reuse, but it's sort of like, you know,

76
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,337
zero with order physical behavior.

77
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,721
It doesn't provide overrides and inserts for cross-scenario authoring,

78
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:48,026
but was definitely far more reusable than Fassad's social behavior.

79
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,647
And it was symmetric.

80
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,830
Anything the characters could do, the player can do.

81
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,152
In this case, since it's sort of a god-like game,

82
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,575
the player is sort of, in a sense, determining

83
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:01,398
which of the affordances characters are computed they want to do next, they take.

84
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,662
But you could imagine versions of using the underlying social engine

85
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:10,025
where the players have a menu of exactly the same kind of affordances that the characters have.

86
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:14,049
This is very much the approach also that Richard Evans took with Praxis,

87
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:20,174
the engine behind Versu, was this kind of symmetry at this kind of discrete choice point level.

88
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:24,137
But, like in Versu, we achieve that by simplifying affordances.

89
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:28,601
The affordances are discrete choices that can sort of be computed and put into a menu.

90
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,643
It's not real time at all.

91
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:35,348
strict turn-based interaction, not interruptible during a social exchange,

92
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,591
and it's not mixable. There's only one social exchange occurring at a time.

93
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:41,434
So the current project we're engaged in is to try to say,

94
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,216
hey, can we get the best of both worlds here?

95
00:05:43,296 --> 00:05:47,300
Can we get the reuse and symmetry of Prom Week

96
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,823
and the real-timeness and mixability of Facade

97
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:52,086
in sort of one architecture and approach?

98
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:58,128
We're doing this in the context of a DARPA-funded project in nonspecific cultural training.

99
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:05,711
And what this nonspecific means is what happens if you as the player are sort of dumped into situations

100
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:11,293
where you don't speak the language, you don't understand the sort of cultural values and cultural norms,

101
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:17,015
something's kind of escalating, and what do you do to try to de-escalate the situation

102
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:21,397
to quickly suss out what's going on and keep it from turning into something horrible?

103
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:24,019
That's what's meant by non-specific cultural training.

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,021
This is happening in the context of a sort of whole body interaction system.

105
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:35,144
So if I just sort of play a snippet of this, here's one of our scenarios called the lost

106
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:40,807
interpreter where the player has lost their interpreter and is trying to interact with

107
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:44,729
people who doesn't share a language with other than a few words.

108
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,731
and just trying to find out,

109
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:49,533
hey, have you seen my interpreter from this photo?

110
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:51,894
And so, you know, there's a lot of, you know,

111
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,916
real-time gesture recognition going on,

112
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,757
sort of pose and stance recognition,

113
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,858
facial expression recognition, and so on.

114
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,379
And so those are the signals

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,201
that are kind of coming into the AI,

116
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,242
as opposed to, say, you know,

117
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,003
the text that was being used in facade,

118
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,304
you know, text and mouse movement

119
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:07,505
and clicking that was in facade.

120
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:09,346
So this gives some sense of

121
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:12,028
what the whole body interaction looks like.

122
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:19,878
So you can imagine the full architecture for this is pretty complicated in that there's

123
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,941
sort of a lot of machine learning based gesture stuff we're doing.

124
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:28,283
There's the sort of social pragmatics piece that has to kind of turn that, take that and

125
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,025
turn it into kind of higher level social moves that have occurred.

126
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:35,494
There's a drama manager that's trying to sort of manage

127
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:39,756
for pedagogy and kind of dynamically update the simulator

128
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:41,817
to kind of make specific pedagogical points.

129
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,778
And then within the social simulator itself

130
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:46,179
is this new NPC architecture and approach

131
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,179
that we've been building.

132
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,700
For the purposes of this talk,

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,982
we're focusing specifically on the kind of social behavior

134
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:54,923
NPC system within the social simulator

135
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,124
and not the rest of the architecture.

136
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:59,266
And this is being done by, you know,

137
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,026
a fairly large distributed team.

138
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:03,768
split across four organizations.

139
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:07,631
And the UC Santa Cruz team along with BBN

140
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,973
are responsible specifically for the autonomous characters.

141
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:14,856
So what lessons are we borrowing from Prom Week?

142
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:16,077
What are we bringing from Prom Week?

143
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:18,954
that we're then going to adapt and enlarge on.

144
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:22,254
The first is the idea of declarative modeling for the characters.

145
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:27,676
You know, we do a lot of declarative modeling for other aspects of NPC interaction, right?

146
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:31,637
I mean, we keep track of positions, we keep track of like how much ammo, you know,

147
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:37,339
there's a lot of sort of declarative state about the state of the world that we do, you know,

148
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:41,500
say put on a blackboard for our characters to respond to.

149
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,481
But we don't do it so much for social interaction.

150
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,281
And Fassad did.

151
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:49,425
So a lot of the character state between characters,

152
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:52,588
between Trip and Grace, was implicit in the behaviors.

153
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:57,873
It wasn't explicitly being modeled as values that are being changed by moves the AI is making.

154
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,396
This was one of the first things that PromWeek did, is to say,

155
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:02,837
hey, let's make all of that explicit.

156
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:08,061
traits, social statuses, the current social state existing

157
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:10,483
between all pairwise combinations of characters,

158
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,665
make that declarative and explicit.

159
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,007
And now the system can start reasoning about it

160
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:17,269
and explicitly taking social action to change it.

161
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,952
The other big thing we did there in prom week

162
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:23,174
that we're adapting is this kind of utilities

163
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,055
meet symbolic reasoning, this kind

164
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:27,557
of soft rule-based reasoning approach.

165
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:32,563
So we all know from hearing talks from, say, Dave and Kevin over the years,

166
00:09:33,143 --> 00:09:36,447
the benefits of, and we may recognize this diagram,

167
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:39,310
the benefits of utility-based methods.

168
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,053
That they keep you out of corners in the state space,

169
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,996
you're constantly able to compute a value.

170
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:50,759
that the brittleness, basically, that symbolic techniques tend to have, go away.

171
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,641
But symbolic techniques are able to express much more complicated situations,

172
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:03,324
like if X feels high romance towards Y, and Z does something mean to X,

173
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:08,186
and then Y does something mean to Z,

174
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:13,148
then there's going to be this tendency for X to want to date Y.

175
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,491
because Y basically came in as a knight in shining armor

176
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:21,733
and saved X from being picked on by Z.

177
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:26,396
This kind of temporal, rule-based reasoning is really hard to capture

178
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:30,358
as sort of algebraic combinations of sigmoids and exponentials and so on

179
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,960
is very easy to capture in a symbolic system.

180
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,842
But then we lose, then we're in brittle land, right?

181
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:40,825
And we lose this kind of common currency and no edges,

182
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:44,167
no brittle corners property that utilities have.

183
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,748
So what we do is on the right hand side of rules,

184
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:49,550
instead of sort of computing like do this action,

185
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,151
for example, if something's true,

186
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,994
we just say add three to your tendency to want to date.

187
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:58,096
Add two to your tendency to do something mean and so forth.

188
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,418
So implicitly, you're actually computing multiple,

189
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:03,519
really complicated utility surfaces.

190
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,261
that are implicitly being computed by a bunch of rule-based reasoning.

191
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:14,025
And so we're trying to get sort of the common currency and no corners aspect of utilities

192
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,466
with the rich expressiveness of symbols.

193
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:21,068
So those are the sort of two big lessons from PromWeek that we're then saying,

194
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,389
well, how do we do this with real-time reactive...

195
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,035
3D characters. So the first thing we need to do is take the notion of dialogue exchange and generalize it.

196
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:34,158
So in Prom Week, you can imagine that you have templated dialogue exchanges like this, and I

197
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:39,082
won't go into this sort of natural language system, but you can imagine that you wrote maybe a thousand

198
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:43,466
of these, and they're not specific to any character. They're just floating in space, right? And you can

199
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:48,230
imagine that all the AI of Prom Week is basically just trying to say, in this specific situation in

200
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,630
the game,

201
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:53,314
which of these many dialogue exchanges that are sort of just floating in space

202
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:57,838
do I want to zoom, zap, zap down onto these particular characters

203
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:01,882
at this specific time so that it's social state and personality appropriate.

204
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,885
Like that's the, that's the sort of re-targeting that's going on.

205
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:07,807
Well, we need to turn this now into behaviors, right?

206
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:12,291
That what was before kind of a NLG-based template

207
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:15,875
now becomes a fairly complex behavior tree

208
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:19,359
that's controlling sort of what initiators, responders,

209
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:22,682
and onlookers are kind of all doing reactively

210
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,944
and in real time during the carrying out

211
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:28,848
of that social exchange.

212
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:34,806
So the specific idiom we've developed to capture this is this notion of social games,

213
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:37,167
which we talked about social games and facade,

214
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:40,728
but in facade they were sort of like a design idea,

215
00:12:41,048 --> 00:12:42,889
but weren't reified in the architecture.

216
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,989
Now we're reifying them in the architecture.

217
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:48,830
So two examples of social games that we've implemented are alliance and authority.

218
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:53,637
Alliance is the general idea of NPCs and the player,

219
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:55,699
and sort of any number of them, having

220
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:58,824
kind of a bidirectional alliance values between them,

221
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,407
how much I feel like you're currently

222
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,770
could be one of my allies.

223
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:08,753
And then this binary allies thing, which can be accomplished through social exchange.

224
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:12,115
If I feel high alliance towards you and you feel high alliance towards me,

225
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:18,159
we're going to have a tendency to want to take social action that actually establishes the binary or Boolean social fact

226
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,221
of currently being allies, and then allies may break up and so forth.

227
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,762
So all of that states modeled.

228
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:31,927
The authority game is really about authority that NPCs and characters generally, players and NPCs,

229
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:37,889
have over each other and also authority over objects, who owns objects, who can do what with what objects.

230
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:49,333
So a social game sort of like bottles up the social state associated with a particular general domain of social interaction.

231
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:58,696
Then also associated with social games are these kind of utility-based volition rules that we talked about with prom weeks.

232
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:04,428
but then use that state plus sort of inferred intermediate state

233
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:07,689
to assign utilities to performing particular actions.

234
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:13,751
So here, the bottom rule in alliance

235
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,332
says that if you have a certain volition

236
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:19,093
to do an allies make move between x and y,

237
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,334
and gifting is appropriate between x and y,

238
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:23,135
and that would be computed by some other rules,

239
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,656
and there's an object in the world that's tagged as a gift,

240
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:38,756
then you have a certain utility that you're going to sort of transitively move over from your volition to allies make to object transfer to perform the specific move object transfer.

241
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:42,518
And object transfer is now going to be sort of one of these.

242
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:45,836
behavior tree things that handles all of this sort of

243
00:14:45,936 --> 00:14:48,858
detailed moment to moment interruptible activity around

244
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,521
transferring objects. Similarly in the authority game,

245
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:55,284
manipulate object is something that's computed at the bottom

246
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:57,806
rule and you can see sort of intermediate rules that compute

247
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:01,689
utilities on doing what we call authority up moves. Okay, so

248
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,452
once you've sort of snapped one of these social games into your

249
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:08,975
scenario, you now have a bunch of utilities being computed for

250
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:09,776
performing actions.

251
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:13,071
You have the social state necessary to reason over those,

252
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:16,655
and you get a bunch of social interaction units that come in,

253
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,477
which are like the atomic actions now.

254
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,039
So here's the social interaction unit for object transfer,

255
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,303
which is actually a sequential one, sequential and hierarchical.

256
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:29,348
It says, perform these three lower-level social interactions in sequence.

257
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,270
An optional request of object.

258
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,292
an offer object, and an accept object.

259
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,874
Within each of those, you have parallel behaviors

260
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,895
for the initiator, for the responder, and the audience.

261
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:40,057
You have to have accept and reject behaviors,

262
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,998
because just because someone decides

263
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:43,599
they want to initiate a social interaction

264
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,061
doesn't mean that the responder wants to do it.

265
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:47,702
So that's computed by volition rules.

266
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:50,264
But then how do you actually perform accept and reject?

267
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,967
You have to have the ability for the player to perform any role

268
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,508
and the NPC to perform any role.

269
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:58,010
And so that means that you have a lot of behaviors that

270
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,672
are also kind of listening in a context-specific way

271
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:04,093
to these signals coming from the whole body interface

272
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:08,075
and interpreting them according to the context.

273
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:11,237
You have to have appropriate monitoring behaviors for player

274
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,598
action, reactive staging behaviors, emotion side

275
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:13,998
effects.

276
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,540
And recursively, an SIU may make sub-decisions

277
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,182
about performance using behavior scope depletion rules.

278
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:24,123
And this is one of the key kind of architectural modifications

279
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,844
we've made is to take this volition approach, which

280
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:29,345
was in prom week only used at the top level

281
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:31,846
to make a high level decision about what

282
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:33,567
social action to do next.

283
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,167
And we want to say, hey, that would be really cool

284
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:39,689
and powerful to have that kind of decision making capability

285
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:40,889
all the way down.

286
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:45,695
right, all the way down to like low-level animation control performance behaviors

287
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:49,699
if needed. So to describe a teeny bit about what we're doing

288
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,663
there, I won't belabor the ABLE language.

289
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,365
There was a talk at GDC 2004 about it.

290
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:01,689
It is a reactive planner that has a library of behaviors, a working memory that's like

291
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,771
a blackboard system, a sort of sensor and action abstraction for interacting with the

292
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:09,974
world, and then this active behavior tree that the main thing that's different between

293
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:13,616
this and many behavior tree architectures is it's not a static behavior tree.

294
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:17,518
You don't sort of author a behavior tree, you just author bags of behaviors.

295
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:23,161
And the behavior tree is dynamically computed as the character's executing and is changing

296
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:23,842
moment to moment.

297
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:27,378
And this was a class of architectures

298
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:30,478
that sort of came from the late 80s called reactive planners.

299
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:33,139
And in fact, Damian was working with Bruce Blumberg

300
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,219
at the Media Lab in a similar kind of architecture, which

301
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:38,880
is where he got the idea for the kind of behavior tree

302
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,760
implementation he did in Halo.

303
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,401
And so there is a historical connection

304
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,581
between reactive planners and behavior trees.

305
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,282
But the big difference is there is no static behavior tree.

306
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:52,763
It's a dynamically computed data structure, basically,

307
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:53,883
that changes moment to moment.

308
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:57,128
All right, so in the ABLE execution,

309
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,969
there are sort of three places where

310
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,530
ABLE has choices it has to make.

311
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,551
The conflict set, which is the leaves of the tree.

312
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,052
These are all the things I could do next.

313
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,493
And this is where you get parallel intermixing going on.

314
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,056
And ABLE comes with its own sort of default algorithm

315
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:12,377
that's based on priorities and anti-thrashing heuristic

316
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:16,780
and the notion of step conflicts to resolve that.

317
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:22,365
There's behavior choice for a particular sub-goal, preconditioned behavior specificity, and there's conditional steps.

318
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,969
The new version of ABLE uses rule-based utilities at any of these choice points.

319
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,052
So the idea is that this whole sort of, you know,

320
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:35,216
SIF, social simulation engine-like reasoning, can now be recursively inserted.

321
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:39,058
anywhere in ABLE that it would make one of these other choices.

322
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:44,381
So you've got the default way you would do it, and then you can write rules and do this sort of rule-based utility way.

323
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:47,743
And so that's how we're getting this kind of recursive decision-making all the way down.

324
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:54,026
Working with Michael has been a privilege and a trip.

325
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:57,628
He gets to pretend he has money and I get to pretend I'm interesting.

326
00:18:58,034 --> 00:19:01,017
And I also have to talk very quickly here to keep us on any kind of schedule.

327
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:09,924
So this slide is just summarizing how we deal with the question of character individuation in this kind of framework.

328
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:15,149
Characters are differentiated from each other by the list of things on the left.

329
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:21,117
This is old hat and apple pie those things man those differences manifest in the way

330
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:27,446
They do things how they perform what they look like how they move their pacing and and at a higher level by the choices

331
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,788
They make about what they will do

332
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:35,796
We produce those differences then with the declarative representation of the character that we've been talking about so far,

333
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:41,279
and rule sets that map those differences in representation into different behavior choices.

334
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:45,140
And then we have the ability to override things specifically so that if somebody,

335
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,482
instead of getting louder and faster when they get angry, gets slower and more threatening,

336
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:52,844
we can mix that in if that's the right thing for a particular character.

337
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:55,825
Finally, we can put in custom behaviors.

338
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,786
We can do it the old-fashioned way if that's what's necessary to make things go.

339
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:06,772
And the big question is, how do we manage all this combined content without having to deal with the N-squared authoring combination that's going on?

340
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:15,519
Well, we do a performance management, which I'll describe in a minute, to sequence the low-level behaviors.

341
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,024
We interpret physical behavior on the character's part, and this is to get that symmetry that Michael was talking about,

342
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:26,648
so that it gets translated into the same social signals that the NPCs are passing amongst each other.

343
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:35,157
We use something called wrap-ons, which are ways to wrap attitude into a behavior or cross-cutting behaviors into another behavior that's goal-directed.

344
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:40,562
And finally, then, we do support author-defined overrides to deal with particular problems when they come up.

345
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:44,175
Performance management is a simple process.

346
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:47,016
Well, it's a rather straightforward process

347
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:50,358
of prioritizing different activities amongst the many

348
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,339
competing things that an NPC might do,

349
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:55,660
and even that the various body parts of an NPC

350
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,761
might do at any particular time, and then

351
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,603
going with the highest priority for a particular set of body

352
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:03,084
parts so that you can talk while you're eating

353
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,205
and your hands can remain eating because they're not

354
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,906
going to do the gesticulating that they do ordinarily

355
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,726
while you are talking.

356
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:13,328
So that takes care of a lot of interaction at a low level.

357
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:17,349
When we're dealing with this problem of symmetry with the player,

358
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,530
because remember the player is standing in front of all these sensors actually doing things,

359
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,971
we get a signal from the sensing system that's a physical behavior,

360
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:26,411
like the player extended their arm or they shouted.

361
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:32,896
We interpret that with a set of rules that are seeded by expectations from the social simulator.

362
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:35,858
So if an NPC has just offered something to the player,

363
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,760
the expectation that the player will either accept it or decline it

364
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:40,882
will get passed over to the interpretation rule.

365
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:43,704
So if the player extends their hand in that situation,

366
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,746
they must be trying to accept the object.

367
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,965
If they shouted instead, that wouldn't

368
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,447
be interpretable in the context.

369
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,629
It would fall into a set of initiation rules

370
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:54,331
that would try to say, well, maybe the player's

371
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:56,433
trying to do something new that's not going on right now,

372
00:21:56,473 --> 00:21:58,775
and we need to start a new activity to accommodate

373
00:21:58,795 --> 00:21:59,716
what the player's doing.

374
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:02,238
Finally, we're doing these things called wrap-ons,

375
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,321
which are simply cross-cutting behaviors that

376
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:07,564
express attitudes of what's going on, or which, yeah,

377
00:22:07,604 --> 00:22:07,724
right.

378
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:16,030
or which deal with common behaviors like thanking people or dealing with confusion.

379
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:21,516
This is to achieve this dream of a substrate of real social interaction that's going on.

380
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:25,962
And basically what are we trying to do with all this stuff?

381
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:27,785
Well, we would like to create a social engine.

382
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,093
We saw an example of one of those things in Reza's talk yesterday morning about Sims Medieval

383
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:38,101
so that all the characters have this kind of baseline repertoire of social behaviors that they can draw on.

384
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:40,763
This enables new games with a purpose, potentially,

385
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,744
like we're using it to train social skills

386
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,446
or to accomplish the social process of teaching.

387
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:47,367
Finally, if the player is socially

388
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,569
engaged with the game, they'll become socially uncomfortable,

389
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,089
socially rewarded by smiles.

390
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,011
And all of these things can be used

391
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:55,052
to enrich the kind of behavior that they've been having.

392
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,073
Where we're going next, we've got

393
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,555
all these games that have separate representations

394
00:22:59,595 --> 00:22:59,975
of state.

395
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,516
We have to figure out how to share across them.

396
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,697
We're dealing with blending animations

397
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:05,338
to go with our blended behavior and hitting

398
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:06,799
a bunch of problems that you guys are probably

399
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,440
familiar with.

400
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,542
We'd like to go farther with these cross-cutting behaviors,

401
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:13,824
and we would like to apply more of the social state information

402
00:23:13,844 --> 00:23:15,585
to the interpretation of the user's behavior

403
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,107
to deal with highly ambiguous or complex situations.

404
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:18,827
And thank you very much.
