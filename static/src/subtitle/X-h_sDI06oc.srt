1
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:08,556
You are here for a panel called,

2
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:11,458
How Do You Make VR for Everyone?

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,300
I hope that's why you're here.

4
00:00:14,921 --> 00:00:15,902
I'm Doug Northcook.

5
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:19,084
I'm a professor of immersive media

6
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:20,885
at Chatham University in Pittsburgh,

7
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:24,408
where we are starting a four-year undergraduate program

8
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:26,649
specifically focused on immersive technology.

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,253
And I also do various other things.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,412
And with me today are the best people that I know.

11
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:38,713
I'll let them introduce themselves.

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,274
My name is Robin Hunnecke.

13
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,715
I'm on the advisory board for VRDC.

14
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,896
Please fill out your forms after you see the session.

15
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:48,277
It's a great way to get feedback.

16
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:49,657
And please silence your cell phone.

17
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:51,278
And if you're going to ask questions,

18
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:53,179
use the mic so that we get it on the record.

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,440
I have to say those things because that's for GEC.

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,941
I'm a professor and also CEO and game designer.

21
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:05,503
I run a program at UC Santa Cruz, which is an undergraduate Bachelor of the Arts in Games

22
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:09,904
and Playable Media, and also a master's program there, which is in digital arts and new media,

23
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:15,446
both of which help lots of people from all walks of life get access to emerging technologies

24
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:16,246
and make games for them.

25
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:19,107
And then I also am the CEO of Phenomena,

26
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,789
which is local here in San Francisco.

27
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:24,730
We're 30 people and we make weird games like Wattam,

28
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,432
which is coming out on the PlayStation this summer.

29
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:30,894
And Luna, which is also coming out on the PlayStation

30
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:33,295
in PSVR and will be at PAX.

31
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:35,056
So that's what I've been doing lately.

32
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:37,217
I'm really glad to see all of you here.

33
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:37,837
Thanks for coming.

34
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,659
Hi new friends.

35
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:49,620
I'm Sai. I'm previously the studio director of Alchemy Labs. We did Job Simulator and

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,045
Rick and Morty and I have left to start a super secret stealth new project and that's

37
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,206
basically where I'm at right now.

38
00:01:58,895 --> 00:01:59,675
Hi, everybody.

39
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,257
I'm Kat Harris.

40
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:05,120
I previously, where Kat Harris was, at Microsoft,

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,843
doing awesome R&D design development for now,

42
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:12,405
I can say like, ooh, HoloLens 2 is out, yay!

43
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:14,707
And cool, like, Azure Spatial Anchors,

44
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:15,328
you should check it out,

45
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,149
because they're freaking awesome.

46
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,613
But now, currently, I am a designer and prototyper

47
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:23,874
at a company called Magnopus,

48
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:26,877
who did Cocoa VR and

49
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:31,540
Blade Runner VR game and also does cool VR production stuff.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,221
So that is where I am currently at.

51
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:35,102
Yay.

52
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,463
Okay, great.

53
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:43,267
So today's panel comes out of a very special event

54
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:46,409
that I was honored to host back in the fall,

55
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,610
which is called The Convening,

56
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,372
which is an event that...

57
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,793
at Fallingwater, which is pictured here,

58
00:02:53,893 --> 00:02:56,235
which is an iconic Frank Lloyd Wright designed house

59
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:57,976
outside of Pittsburgh where I live.

60
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:02,018
And the curators at Fallingwater and their directors

61
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:05,660
were gracious enough to offer me the convening for 2018,

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,802
which is a funded event to work

63
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:12,443
on a difficult design problem.

64
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,784
And I was like, I've got a lot of those.

65
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:20,479
So I invited a group of designers, developers, people working in VR,

66
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,203
specifically to ask the question that is this panel, which is,

67
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:27,387
how do we make VR something that is for everybody?

68
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,299
And that weekend was really great.

69
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,180
It was really productive.

70
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,803
And we've seen a lot of really interesting movement

71
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:36,706
come out of those conversations

72
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,370
and go back into the companies that were a part of that.

73
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,532
And so we wanted to come and share

74
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,375
some of those conversations.

75
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,598
And for us, this is also a chance to continue

76
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,501
some of those conversations with each other.

77
00:03:48,882 --> 00:03:53,204
And the thing that I'm maybe the most excited about is that right after that,

78
00:03:53,425 --> 00:04:00,029
Robin came back out to Fallingwater and we worked with an amazing zine artist in Chicago named Gage Linston.

79
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:09,815
And Fallingwater funded the creation of a zine that we actually have the first print run here today for all of you to take home with you.

80
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:15,099
Hopefully we have enough. If we run out, just follow me on Twitter and I'll make sure that...

81
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,661
a copy gets to you digitally or otherwise.

82
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,343
And the zine is an imagining of the future

83
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:25,626
in the year 2050, where students from all over the world

84
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,547
go to high school together in VR.

85
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,510
And it is an attempt to imagine a bright future

86
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,992
where we are more global and more connected and more fun

87
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:36,313
and it's really weird.

88
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:40,076
And it will be in the museum store at Fallingwater,

89
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:42,297
which is a laugh for me.

90
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:42,418
So.

91
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,945
So when we got up to the convening, where there's no internet and no cell phone service,

92
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:57,591
we spent part of our initial time going up to the studio space that's there, taking a

93
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:03,256
piece of butcher paper, wrapping the entire studio in it, and listing all of our problems.

94
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:04,518
And I'll tell you...

95
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,979
There were many.

96
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,861
This is one section of one part of one wall with a list of problems,

97
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,422
ranging from problems with content,

98
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:18,323
problem with the ability of creators to share meaningful work,

99
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:22,965
the inability of creators to work on broader use cases,

100
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,125
social problems, ethical problems,

101
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,167
people getting sick the first time they try VR and then never doing it again.

102
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:33,228
I mean, this was hours and hours of just listing problems.

103
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:35,829
But it felt so good.

104
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:36,750
It felt so good.

105
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,572
It was a really great moment of catharsis.

106
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:39,493
We needed to purge.

107
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,196
We needed to purge and just put that out there so we could like touch it.

108
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,537
Like, oh, these are the problems.

109
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:47,601
It was also great to just see them because then you're like, oh, now we can like tackle

110
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:49,983
them now that they're all out there.

111
00:05:50,403 --> 00:05:52,325
Or just drink.

112
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:55,708
Yeah.

113
00:05:55,728 --> 00:05:59,851
And so after just vomiting all of these problems

114
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:04,075
onto the wall, we spent part of the next day

115
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,777
kind of sifting through those problems and identifying for us

116
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:09,960
what were the themes that we were seeing

117
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,221
and what were the things that all

118
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,903
of our companies and institutions

119
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:14,184
have identified as.

120
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:18,965
the most meaningful areas to move this forward,

121
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:22,566
which is not just how do we get more users into VR,

122
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:26,267
but how do we get more kinds of users into VR.

123
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,868
And so we're gonna talk through a few of those pieces today

124
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,808
and talk through some of the things that we're working on

125
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:35,708
and some of the things that we're seeing

126
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,889
and also some of the things that we are hoping

127
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,369
that you all will work on,

128
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:41,730
because there's only four of us and there's a lot of you.

129
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,213
And so the first thing that we worked on up there

130
00:06:46,394 --> 00:06:49,434
was talking about accessibility for users.

131
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:52,095
And that was a really broad-reaching conversation,

132
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:56,537
going from access for people with a wider range of abilities,

133
00:06:56,797 --> 00:07:00,278
access related to economics, and finance.

134
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:04,759
And so we're going to kind of start there and give each of us

135
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,020
an opportunity to kind of talk about.

136
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,381
what we took away from that part of the conversation and ask each other some questions.

137
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:15,203
Yeah, and I was gonna say that I think that one of the best things about the convening was that it was people from all

138
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:17,424
walks of the creative and

139
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:23,007
sort of implementation pipeline of VR and AR and mixed reality. So we had people there that work on tools,

140
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:24,807
we have people there that work on software,

141
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:29,930
we have people that were working on the hardware and then demo content for this new stuff that's coming out.

142
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,731
But also people who are thinking more and more about the

143
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:37,492
the harder, longer-term problems of living in a society where this is a reality.

144
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:41,374
Where it's not like, what if there's a market or what if there's an option,

145
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,115
but just like five years from now or ten years from now, when it's a reality,

146
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:46,555
what is our experience going to be?

147
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:50,096
And I think that Kat was really good at talking about accessibility issues

148
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:55,058
from the perspective of trying to build like a second-gen headset, you know?

149
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:57,479
And so I was just curious to hear some of your thoughts about that stuff.

150
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:09,931
Yeah, so again, I came from the Microsoft side, so tools from hardware from trying, especially nowadays, Microsoft is very open source and trying to create this.

151
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:18,066
open foundation for a lot of different types of realities to be developed for.

152
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:24,489
And so a lot of the accessibility is, okay, everyone, especially with new facial tracking

153
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,171
and new sensors, we're all trying to rebuild our own systems from the ground up, and there

154
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:35,093
isn't a lot of sharing, which is the exact opposite of accessibility and being able to

155
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,694
get new people into the space.

156
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:50,559
And so a lot of what I have seen in the past and what a lot of developers now are learning is that if we do have these walled gardens, all of a sudden we have fragmentation everywhere.

157
00:08:51,199 --> 00:09:00,203
And the whole point of open source is to, okay, we have these protocols now or we have a design foundation where

158
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:10,122
Okay, if I'm holding an object in VR, now if Sai wants to grab that object from me,

159
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:15,727
and she has a different headset or a different set of controllers, what does that look like? How do we

160
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:21,392
have that foundation of at least ideas of how that will work? And for our phones,

161
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,615
we all know that pinching means zoom.

162
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,722
like that is in any phone and any sort of tablet,

163
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,564
we know that that's the functionality that is expected.

164
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,566
But we don't have any of that for VR,

165
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:33,947
because no one's talking about it.

166
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,648
Or some people are talking about it,

167
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:37,750
but we still haven't explored enough.

168
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,730
And it's still so new.

169
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:44,114
And we can't have these divides in our foundation

170
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:49,378
for different hardwares if we expect that whole, like,

171
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,979
generation of adoption to be like, hey, everyone is using this now,

172
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,322
how do we get to that next step?

173
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:59,727
I think also just in terms of working together as a group, you know, one of the

174
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,610
things that has come up in a lot of these conversations is the fact that

175
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,654
while there are these little pockets of funding and there are little ways in

176
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,756
which you can engage with a particular hardware

177
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,959
and that creator's group inside that hardware

178
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:13,662
and stuff like that, we're a really small community.

179
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:16,306
Like you could probably reach out

180
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:18,288
and poke someone in the audience

181
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:19,770
who's either working on something

182
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,212
that's similar to what you're doing

183
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:22,854
or is interested in a problem that you have.

184
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,917
our ability to spend the weekend together talking about these problems,

185
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:29,478
it made it very clear to us that accessibility is a lot about

186
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:33,059
how much we share in terms of our design language and our problems.

187
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,600
And that idea of just putting the problems out there,

188
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,902
like this is not the first time people have made VR, you know?

189
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:40,222
Yeah.

190
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,523
I see you, Brenda.

191
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,688
Like, you know, I mean, these are not new questions.

192
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:48,692
But it's significant that at every turn,

193
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,754
the way that the system is designed

194
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:54,779
to have us make innovative, capitalistic decisions that,

195
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,000
like, make someone rich.

196
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,781
means that the actual research part of it is, it's not as open.

197
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:04,183
And so I think one of the things that we talked about a lot of this beginning of the

198
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:08,324
convening was just like, let's talk to each other more and like let's be honest when

199
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:08,704
we're not

200
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:12,725
really solving the problem. Like pretending that you're solving the problem is kind of

201
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,626
shitty for everyone.

202
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:18,687
And it also, just remind me, it also reminded all of us that like

203
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:21,788
which problems are actually problems

204
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,049
and which ones that we think are problems but aren't actually like

205
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:29,984
important to solve yet and just laying it all out and talking to all the different people it was like,

206
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:33,005
oh, I'm working on this and it's like, oh, why are you working on that?

207
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:38,526
Like why do you think this is a problem? And why should we tackle that one first? Because

208
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:45,068
like you saw that butcher paper again, it went all the way around the room. Some problems are very much dependent on other problems.

209
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:49,349
So it's like you have to figure out which ones we wanted to tackle first. Yeah, and in which order. Yeah.

210
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:56,056
Well, a big part of the conversation about accessibility went not just to making content

211
00:11:56,096 --> 00:12:01,240
and making tools more accessible to developers, but also making content more accessible to

212
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,104
a wider range of users, which I know is something, Sai, that you've done many talks on.

213
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:06,764
A lot.

214
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:08,485
That's kind of my jam.

215
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,467
So I'm wondering if you can just speak to that part of the conversation.

216
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:11,848
Yeah.

217
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:14,129
You know, I think about that a lot in terms of like, what's the widest?

218
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,374
The VR is for everyone, that is a deeply feeling thing in me.

219
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:23,138
I deeply believe that VR is the most human technology we have, period.

220
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:27,602
So you have to make it for as many humans as possible and really expand that definition

221
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,463
of what human is, which is.

222
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:33,105
you know, not just me and what I would like to see and what I want to make.

223
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:36,446
So like a lot of what we did, like especially with Alchemy Labs content, is

224
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:39,708
again, try and make it for a wide range of human beings. And this was

225
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,689
both in terms of interest, age,

226
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,871
and also like ability level. So like, so for example,

227
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,932
a lot of the things that we did is we thought about like in

228
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,854
Rick and Morty, we thought a lot about making

229
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:58,198
everything one-handed interactions because we had failed with that with one… there

230
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:01,760
was one interaction in Job Simulator that required two hands.

231
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,461
It was just one.

232
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:03,662
It was just one.

233
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,444
And if we… no, that's not… that's bad.

234
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:10,747
I mean, but like the fact that you knew that it was just one and that like, oh, we fixed

235
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:11,208
it next time.

236
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:14,271
Yeah, and we worked on that. And that was another thing, like, you know,

237
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,876
a lot of the games I like to make are the games that, like, you know, are very, I like

238
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:21,619
to move around a lot, right? Like, I like to bend down and pick out and navigate with

239
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,084
a space and walk around a space. But we also had to make it, you know, a smaller space

240
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:29,168
so you could have standing room only or sitting room only. We put in

241
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:32,790
In Rick and Morty, which is we took a lot of lessons

242
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,230
from Jobs later and then went to Rick and Morty,

243
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,590
we did something where if something was on the ground,

244
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,991
we actually had it hover a little bit

245
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,851
so you didn't have to bend over to pick it up as much.

246
00:13:41,391 --> 00:13:44,112
Because we found some users who had some mobility issues,

247
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,032
like back issues, whatever, it just sort of helped them.

248
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,913
And so that was something that was really important

249
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,013
for us to do in terms of our game content.

250
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:53,974
In addition to that, the actual game itself

251
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,394
was made for as many humans and beings as possible.

252
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,655
We didn't want you to have to be, say, a gamer.

253
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:02,960
to come in and play this. Like VR is for everyone. I want to be able to give it to

254
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,868
a tiny child. Although I would never do that because VR is for people who are over the age of 13 only.

255
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,055
But were a child to play it.

256
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,136
We're a five year old to grab the headset.

257
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,617
This comes up all the time, right?

258
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,599
Like if you, you know, VR is an experiential sale, right?

259
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,941
You don't get into VR because you thought it would be cool and then you're gonna dump

260
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,742
a bunch of money on a VR headset and a computer to run it or whatever.

261
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,723
It's the thing that you go and you try it and you experience it.

262
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:32,784
And we all know this.

263
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:34,365
It's something that we don't talk about a lot in the community.

264
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:35,905
And kids just get it.

265
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:36,465
They just get it.

266
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:39,907
Like, you put the headset on the kid, they're immediately there.

267
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,628
They're doing what… they don't care about looking stupid.

268
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,909
And it's the same as with the Wii, you know?

269
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,450
Like, you would give the Wii controller to someone and tell them to throw a ball in the

270
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,331
blue box and they would just go…

271
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,289
I do think that.

272
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:52,069
Like, embarrassing.

273
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,530
But like, our best audience is coming up now, right?

274
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,051
They're technically not supposed to be in the headset because, I don't know, eyes grow

275
00:14:59,091 --> 00:14:59,411
or something.

276
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,011
Or something, yeah.

277
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,911
They budge.

278
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:01,251
Whatever.

279
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:07,052
I just published this article with the Oculus developer blog about universal design, which

280
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:11,753
is an architectural principle that basically says that if you design something for everyone,

281
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:16,674
you're designing something for yourself because at some point, you will be someone else.

282
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:26,240
Yeah, I think that's something that a lot of developers and designers really miss is that they design for themselves in a specific moment.

283
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:38,749
This is a temporary situation. Like many things are going to change over the years. I get very rowdy. I hurt myself. You know, my abilities change rapidly. And then there's the long term.

284
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,271
Yeah, I can guarantee at some point I will be.

285
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:48,564
My vision will change, my hearing will change, and my ability to play super hot and bend

286
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:53,006
like all the way backwards into like balancing half moon will change.

287
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:54,187
I hope not.

288
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,867
I believe in you.

289
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,649
Yeah, but I think, you know, it's a really easy thing to miss.

290
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,111
And I think a lot of people think about designing for other, they're like, oh, well, I don't,

291
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:05,532
that's not my user.

292
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,232
And it's like, well.

293
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,293
It will be at some point.

294
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:09,935
At some point, your users will change.

295
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:10,935
Your users will age.

296
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:13,337
And we're trying to think about developing

297
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:15,859
a platform and experiences that have longevity

298
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,320
and that are adaptable.

299
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,142
And a perfect example, one of my colleagues

300
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:21,003
came to my office last week.

301
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:23,445
And he is in his late 50s.

302
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:24,886
And he loves VR.

303
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,488
He has a Rift at his house.

304
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,429
His kids think he's a weirdo.

305
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:30,270
And he…

306
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,091
I was like, well, have you tried Beat Saber?

307
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,151
And he was like, no.

308
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:37,754
He's like, I had shoulder surgery last year so I can't raise my left arm above here

309
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:38,314
so I didn't get it.

310
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:42,777
And I was like, well, there's actually one-handed modes that you can totally play.

311
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,859
And he went and got it and then he played it and he was like, oh my gosh, I had no idea.

312
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:47,780
Thank you so much.

313
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,862
And I was like, don't thank me, thank Yaroslav and Jan.

314
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:58,126
But I think Beat Saber specifically is a great example of any, you can play one-handed,

315
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:01,868
they actually are, they just released a video where they're working with Subpac

316
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:08,172
to make a deaf mode for Beat Saber where you play with a haptic vest.

317
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:13,415
And that kind of thinking where that's not just a really great experience for the deaf community

318
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:16,377
and for deaf gamers, but that's also a really great experience for...

319
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:22,201
people who have full range of hearing to be able to have haptic feedback when they're

320
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:26,785
playing. So it's about, you know, creating the broadest range of experiences and adaptability.

321
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:32,409
And when we started making newer technologies that are now no longer considered new, like your

322
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:36,832
phone or even the game console or the internet, you know, even television,

323
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:43,455
When we made these media a while back, we were not that aware of the implicit bias in

324
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:48,757
our design patterns and in the ways that we think about people as a community of developers

325
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:49,877
and designers back then.

326
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:55,479
And this is the first time that we as a community have an opportunity to design for everybody

327
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:59,721
in a way that really is awake and really is aware of the fact that...

328
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:05,911
as it becomes more accessible to use a device to see the world differently, whether you're

329
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:12,020
holding it or wearing it, and that the cost of goods goes down, the explosion in use cases

330
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:14,745
and like what someone's environment is.

331
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:18,987
is huge, right? And it's really important to think about it now

332
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:22,388
and to sort of to think about the bias that you have

333
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:25,629
just even like it will be a living room with a couch

334
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,291
in it is a bias, right? Like some people don't sit on couches.

335
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:32,812
You know, some people don't have that kind of furniture in their living space.

336
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:36,173
Some people have sleeping mats that they roll up and then they sit on floors on

337
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:36,453
the chair.

338
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:40,035
are chairs on the floor that are actually more like a mat. You know, like there's

339
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,495
very different ways of living

340
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,956
that, you know, if you consider these things ahead of time

341
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:47,897
and you get at your unconscious bias now before the explosion of

342
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:51,278
adoption actually happens, you're in a much better place

343
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,579
to build stuff that's human. And this goes into making content too. Not everyone

344
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:56,620
interacts with the world

345
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,301
in the exact same way. People have different expectations of how the world should work.

346
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:03,424
I use an example a lot about making tea.

347
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,688
I make tea the correct way, which is I heat up water.

348
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:12,412
No! That is literally, you're a monster!

349
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:17,437
How could you? But like, no, but this is the thing, right? There are so many ways to make tea.

350
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:21,321
I put my, like a civilized human, I put my tea bag in a cup

351
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:24,163
and then make my water in a kettle.

352
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,911
And then I pour the water over the tea, and then I put the milk in afterward, after it

353
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:30,431
steeps for four and a half minutes.

354
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:35,693
But the thing is that there are other people who put their teabag in the kettle when they're

355
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:36,993
on the stove.

356
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:37,773
Yeah, I know, monstrous.

357
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:43,535
Some people put their milk in first and put the teabag in the milk, turning it into some

358
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,436
trash fluid, and then pour the hot water over it.

359
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:50,477
But the thing is that these are the expectations people have.

360
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,678
They have expectations with their world.

361
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,142
And when you're making content you have to understand the myriad of human beings

362
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,022
are going to interact with it

363
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:01,465
because then it stops being a world and it starts becoming kind of like a

364
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:04,848
tech or a game, right? Like it's not, you lose that magic.

365
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:08,592
So I'm an aggressive demoer. Like I do demos

366
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:12,355
at every conference and not just gaming conferences. I actually go to like

367
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:13,636
museums like I did...

368
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:15,538
Try Becca once.

369
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:17,999
Like, you know, I try and go places

370
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,599
where not necessarily all gamers,

371
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,161
because I want the people who don't have a ready

372
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:25,822
understanding of, like, controllers, for example.

373
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,243
And I watch them very, very closely.

374
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,444
I'm the one that people, when I talk about how I test

375
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:31,984
and how I...

376
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,345
get feedback, people are like, oh well that's just completely infeasible and I'm like, yes,

377
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:40,287
that's what I want. I want to hear people's tiny sighs of disappointment. They won't remember it

378
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,348
afterward when you ask them about it, right? When you ask them like, oh, do you remember when you

379
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,209
sighed in disappointment? They're like, no, I can't remember that one, that one thing, because

380
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:49,790
then they got distracted by something else and was throwing something and put their face in a

381
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,050
wall or whatever it was they were doing.

382
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,693
But I have to look for that and I have to... because that's where the world breaks, right?

383
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:59,915
And that's where I haven't thought about everything that every human might possibly do.

384
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:05,078
We have a unique skill set to design the next way that people see reality where we can decide what

385
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:11,362
physics is like and what time is like and what presence means. And that's a huge amount of power.

386
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:15,164
Like you just have a lot more power in that situation than you realize.

387
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:17,506
And it doesn't sound like genius,

388
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:18,386
the stuff we're talking about,

389
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,208
but it was really, really good to sit down

390
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,489
and just to really hammer on like,

391
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:24,811
what does it really mean to build accessible content?

392
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:26,593
What does it really mean to think about,

393
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:28,494
you know, this becoming the way people live?

394
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:31,979
And I think that's a great segue into our next section,

395
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,002
which is a big part of the problem sets

396
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:40,465
that we identified is both the lack of more diverse creators

397
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,507
and also more diverse content,

398
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,168
which gets back to this issue

399
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,830
of there's so many ways to make tea,

400
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,912
which is that if you're making an experience

401
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:50,013
that is about making tea

402
00:21:50,113 --> 00:21:52,315
and everyone on your team makes tea the same way,

403
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:54,777
your experience is broken.

404
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:01,761
And I think that was a big point of the discussion for us,

405
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:05,083
was really talking about the value of diverse teams

406
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,546
because of this need for a variety of perspectives.

407
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:12,508
And that conversation went a lot of different ways.

408
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:13,708
So we can kind of jump in.

409
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,030
Yeah, I was gonna say that I think that this community,

410
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,791
I've been making games for 20 plus years,

411
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:20,312
and I've seen this community, in particular GDC,

412
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:22,273
like I first came to GDC in 1999.

413
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:25,215
So I've seen this community completely transform.

414
00:22:25,696 --> 00:22:27,318
in the last 10 years, you know?

415
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,942
But I mean, it's just been, it's an asymptotic curve, right?

416
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:32,064
Like the more difference you get,

417
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:33,105
the more difference you support,

418
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,046
the more difference you see,

419
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,349
the more it becomes comfortable and pretty soon.

420
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,171
Like this room is incredibly diverse

421
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,975
compared to what like an experimental gameplay workshop

422
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:42,476
room would look like in 1990, you know, or 2001.

423
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:50,681
So, like, there is already, we have a leg up in this case, that we already have more

424
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:53,903
female creators, we have more creators of color, we have more international creators

425
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:58,925
in this community than any other community that has made games before and has made interactive

426
00:22:58,965 --> 00:22:59,645
content before.

427
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,646
Like, now it's better than it ever has been.

428
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,126
And that is a huge...

429
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,607
That's a huge benefit.

430
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:07,508
And because I think we're used to not necessarily

431
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:10,169
being represented, we're much more open and sharing.

432
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,329
So I think this community already

433
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:12,609
has a leg up in that space.

434
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,711
But this idea that content can be made by anyone

435
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,231
is also possible now.

436
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,892
The ecosystem has changed so dramatically for tools and.

437
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,136
sort of pipelines that

438
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,241
it's just it's a completely different realm.

439
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,686
If you looked at the International Women's Day page

440
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:36,532
you know Oculus had five games by female CEOs and five games by female leads

441
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:37,013
that's 10 games.

442
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:41,835
showcased on International Women's Day. That wasn't an accident, that happened

443
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,235
because Facebook, Oculus has

444
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:46,736
consistently worked to promote

445
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:50,697
and support and pay for the work of women in VR.

446
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:55,158
And that storefront is a testament to the fact that they made that a

447
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:56,778
priority in their funding structures.

448
00:23:57,098 --> 00:24:00,939
And that's the kind of stuff that I think we started talking about. It's like, okay,

449
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:01,599
how are we...

450
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,300
You know, we're all kind of at the cusp of being, you know, connected and we're relatively

451
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,341
around the same age, but there's an entire group of people coming up behind us.

452
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:13,682
How do we make sure that they get connected and get access?

453
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:19,943
And just coming from the opposite side of things, in like the enterprise world, they

454
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:21,263
are not gamers.

455
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:24,864
So they all look exactly the same.

456
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:28,145
They're all back-end developers, some are front-end developers.

457
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:32,033
Even at Microsoft, it was funny to see like,

458
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:35,895
oh, there's so many more people with tattoos

459
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:38,196
and colored hair everywhere and piercings everywhere.

460
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:40,237
When I first started as an evangelist,

461
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:42,177
it was funny because we were all like,

462
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:44,038
okay, no, can't dye our hair.

463
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,079
And then Satya got hired and we were like,

464
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,040
cool, we're all dying our hair purple

465
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,621
and we went to a hackathon and the students came up

466
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:52,322
and they were like, oh, can you tell us

467
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:53,342
who the Microsoft people are?

468
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:54,302
And the person was like,

469
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:56,703
oh, anyone with purple hair and piercings.

470
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,185
go find them. They know all about Azure cloud development and gaming as well.

471
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:05,186
And it was just like, what?

472
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:09,188
And it's very interesting because now you see all these enterprise

473
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:12,929
companies having to have to change because

474
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:17,551
this is not their world and it is very difficult for very

475
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,851
old systems to incorporate

476
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:26,519
new cultures, new ideas of, oh, you need a game designer.

477
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,180
Like, you have to have someone who can actually.

478
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:33,050
figure out the problems of interaction and

479
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,233
figure out how this enterprise application is going to

480
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,235
be interesting and fun and useful

481
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:45,057
for people. And so, again,

482
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:49,280
the problem is, well then, these enterprise people don't know who to hire

483
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,642
because they're like, I don't know who is a game... Exactly, and so then they start

484
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:56,184
coming to GDC and interacting and it starts to

485
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:58,325
evolve and change, but it's...

486
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:00,687
slow and hard.

487
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:06,374
And so it's like very encouraging when you see all these big companies like, oh, okay,

488
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:08,057
I have to hire like a game studio.

489
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:13,945
That makes sense to make my corporate internal training application because now it is.

490
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:19,068
a game, like now it is a game, it can have a 2D component, it can have a virtual

491
00:26:19,108 --> 00:26:19,608
component,

492
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:23,713
AR component, and it's like, cool, we're gonna start doing this now.

493
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:27,177
It's an actual hire, it's not diversity salad. Like I've said this before

494
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:31,401
publicly and I'll say it again, like I've eaten a whole fuckload of diversity salad.

495
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:35,085
Let's get together and have a salad and talk about women in gaming.

496
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:35,926
Like, let's not.

497
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:36,907
Yep.

498
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:38,109
Like, schmoney.

499
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,111
You know what I mean?

500
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:45,317
I don't really need any more salad, but my studio needs to be funded and people that

501
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:46,678
work for me need jobs.

502
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,444
And if you're in the position to fund in VR, fund diverse people.

503
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:52,785
Just do it, right?

504
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:57,770
and fund content that isn't all the same stuff

505
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,693
that people think will work that kind of doesn't scale

506
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:02,594
and doesn't engage a broad, I mean like,

507
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,477
how many people were just like, whoa, Tilt Brush,

508
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:11,203
what an idea, being creative in a virtual space

509
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,405
with glowy stuff, who knew?

510
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,429
You know what I mean? It's like...

511
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,236
Tilt Brush is the best though.

512
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:19,439
This is what I'm saying.

513
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,865
A lot of people were like, wow, I had no idea that

514
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:23,349
virtual painting would be a thing.

515
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:27,646
That's amazing to me, like how could you possibly not?

516
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:31,870
Right? But this is the thing, if you're in the space and you're doing this

517
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,450
stuff, like

518
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:36,414
you make a concrete difference by being available to design, but you also make a

519
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:39,296
difference by being the one that puts the money on the table for that diverse

520
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:39,717
creator.

521
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:43,260
Yeah, and that was a big part of our conversation and a takeaway for a lot of

522
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,803
us was a commitment from everyone in our group to

523
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:52,398
help move that bar as far as we're able to within our own companies and institutions

524
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:59,865
and taking the responsibility of being advocates for just better content made by more different

525
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:00,605
kinds of people.

526
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:05,570
Yeah, we all sort of said could we each like this year could we each try to focus on at

527
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,152
least one person who's coming up in the industry.

528
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:12,314
that needs a mentor, that we can connect either with funding

529
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:15,895
or some kind of a partnership that we think could do good work in this space.

530
00:28:16,115 --> 00:28:18,957
Right? And if we all just committed to just helping one person

531
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:22,298
and then that person as a result was successful and then they could commit to

532
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,078
helping one person

533
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:26,640
that would grow, you know, it's basically the rising tide that floats all boats.

534
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,060
And we think about this sort of stuff a lot.

535
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,881
The VR community, especially like in the very early days,

536
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:35,522
was very, very communicative and very supportive of each other.

537
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:36,542
We all talked to each other.

538
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:39,702
We're all on the same Slack channels and Skype channels

539
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:41,943
and talking constantly and sharing information

540
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:43,423
and constantly talking.

541
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:44,763
But it is that sort of thing where

542
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:46,624
we're trying to sort of reproduce that culture.

543
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,524
And you have to think about the culture we're reproducing.

544
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:50,125
I am planting a flag here.

545
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:53,847
for like weird, interesting, awesome content that is not content that I would make

546
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:58,189
and not content that I would see. And I'm like highly, highly committed to that. And the way we do that is sort of

547
00:28:58,229 --> 00:28:59,270
building this community of

548
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,231
VR developers and say, well this is what we're going to do

549
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:05,873
and we're going to support each other and we're going to lift each other up. And you do that by

550
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:06,354
acting

551
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:09,955
out yourself, right? The change you want to see in the world,

552
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:13,397
being aware of the culture you want to reproduce and like putting that out.

553
00:29:14,098 --> 00:29:16,639
And if you don't know how to do that, if you are like,

554
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:19,681
I would like to help do that, I would like to mentor some or fund

555
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:23,122
someone, if you're like, I don't know how to get started,

556
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:25,063
you just ask us and we will tell you.

557
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,643
There are microphones.

558
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,304
This is an invitation, I think, to the whole community

559
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:34,325
to really think about building the future of what

560
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:37,285
it means to be a person and exist in digital space

561
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,246
and physical space.

562
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:41,927
And that is an incredible responsibility.

563
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,007
And if you don't feel a little bit of that,

564
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,588
you've got to open your eyes a little wider

565
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:49,108
because it's happening.

566
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:49,788
And we're building.

567
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:53,290
We're building something really insane right now.

568
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:58,753
People will look back and remember this time, and some of the paradigms like the pinch are

569
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:00,414
going to be invented in the next few years.

570
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,255
You could be the person that invents that.

571
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:09,619
You could literally save the wrist muscles and hand trauma of thousands of people an

572
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,040
hour, right?

573
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,144
By inventing stuff that's more actually physically feasible for everyone, you could actually

574
00:30:17,164 --> 00:30:18,785
be making a huge impact.

575
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:22,711
When I first started working in games, I left a PhD to work on The Sims.

576
00:30:23,191 --> 00:30:28,540
So I got recruited out of grad school because I didn't want to make drones and I wanted to work on games instead.

577
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,488
So I was working on The Sims and there was an editor for The Sims called Edith and we called it The Crippler.

578
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,914
because it was like it had a bunch of clicky interface stuff in it and like little sliders and

579
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:43,860
I developed severe carpal tunnel within six months of working on it and had to get like

580
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,767
the ergo lady to come to my desk. I mean it was like a physically painful thing to use this editor

581
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:53,451
and it was just because some people just designed it thinking like you just need some

582
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:55,553
some sliders and some check boxes right like.

583
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:59,075
We're way beyond that now, but what you're talking about now is programming the whole

584
00:30:59,136 --> 00:30:59,876
body, right?

585
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:04,899
And so when you have a body that's different or you sit differently in your living room,

586
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:08,541
you're bringing that aspect into this design conversation.

587
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:11,663
That is diversity in action, and it's really important.

588
00:31:12,184 --> 00:31:15,786
And I think about this a lot because, and I hope this isn't an unpopular opinion at

589
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:20,209
Game Developers Conference, but when we bring these concepts from games into VR.

590
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:24,932
Like, we have these paradigms that we sort of have expectations for and we bring them

591
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:25,532
from games.

592
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:30,755
You know, a lot of the clicking, you know, a lot of the button mashing and the abstractions

593
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:34,078
between yourself and how to interact with this virtual world.

594
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:36,819
It's kind of doing a bit of a disservice to VR.

595
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,701
It is a beautiful, wonderful technology of its own.

596
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:44,444
And so what we need right now is so much experimentation and then so much sharing.

597
00:31:44,824 --> 00:31:49,547
So, like, things like this are so important, especially for VR, just in terms of trying

598
00:31:49,587 --> 00:31:50,768
new things and then talking about it.

599
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:51,848
Or yelling on Twitter.

600
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:57,212
I mean, Twitter's another amazing forum for screaming about the things that you experiment.

601
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:58,052
But it is this.

602
00:31:58,092 --> 00:32:02,775
Like, we won't find any of these new… what's the new pinch in VR, for example?

603
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:07,778
I'm still up with the edible menu system, by the way, like picking up menu items and

604
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:08,178
eating them.

605
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:09,079
Quit the game with the burrito.

606
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,440
I think that's going somewhere.

607
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,400
I feel deeply about it.

608
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,481
Well, what I love about…

609
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:17,066
you specifically, I just fangirl over Cy all the time, is that you talk about all the random

610
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,788
shit you try and that failed and why.

611
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:19,669
But with love.

612
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:20,030
But with love.

613
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,511
Yeah, but with love.

614
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:26,437
Because it's interesting because, again, you were saying literally outside, like, what

615
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:26,737
is love?

616
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:27,158
What is love?

617
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:27,498
What is love?

618
00:32:27,518 --> 00:32:27,919
What is love?

619
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:28,359
What is love?

620
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:28,760
What is love?

621
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,120
What is love?

622
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:29,821
What is love?

623
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:30,101
What is love?

624
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:30,502
What is love?

625
00:32:30,522 --> 00:32:31,123
What is love?

626
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:38,290
we're all smart and we might actually be doing the exact same problem, like running into the exact same design issues

627
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:44,097
that someone else already ran into and already proved out and spent hours and time and money and resources

628
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:49,983
that we, like, they already knew, they just didn't share their failures, they shared what they did right.

629
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:52,746
And so you have all these people redoing experiments.

630
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:57,149
that it's like, no, we already did those experiments.

631
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,591
Try it with a different graphics card.

632
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,872
Try it with a different headset.

633
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,874
Like change it slightly, but because we aren't talking,

634
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:06,677
it gets rehashed and rehashed and rehashed.

635
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:09,118
And it's like, okay, we've solidified this, it's good.

636
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:12,501
Let's maybe try something new or change the experiment.

637
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:16,229
We're all very smart.

638
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:18,711
I will make the exact same mistake that you made.

639
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,972
Like, it's not like, oh, no, I was dumb.

640
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:21,812
I made this dumb mistake.

641
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:22,213
No, no, no.

642
00:33:22,313 --> 00:33:23,393
I will make the exact same mistake.

643
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:27,516
So I love things like failure workshops or talking about like, here is a garbage thing

644
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:31,058
that I made and like putting it out and talking about it and why it failed and why it didn't

645
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:31,218
feel...

646
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:32,398
Oh, my God, if you could actually...

647
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:37,401
I've thought about like compiling like experiments of like just things that feel terrible but

648
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:38,162
like everyone...

649
00:33:38,522 --> 00:33:39,463
But everyone else would do it.

650
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:41,466
Like, you know, content warning, bad.

651
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:41,986
Right?

652
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:45,350
But like, and then putting that out and like, here, let's experience these bad things and

653
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,912
we can talk about why it doesn't work.

654
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:47,713
And that's okay.

655
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:48,454
It's okay.

656
00:33:48,714 --> 00:33:49,195
We've learned.

657
00:33:49,355 --> 00:33:49,615
Yeah.

658
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:53,560
So what I, what was interesting is I also went to, I forget, this was probably like

659
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,161
a year ago.

660
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:55,383
And for...

661
00:33:57,066 --> 00:34:00,567
this developer created locomotion and they were experimenting.

662
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,508
And they were like, oh yeah, if you move your arms,

663
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:04,749
you're just going to like parallax slide everywhere.

664
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:08,090
And it's because all of the games that they had played

665
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,151
used really good teleportation and really good locomotion

666
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,372
that they were like, oh, well,

667
00:34:13,612 --> 00:34:14,832
we want to try something different.

668
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,333
And it's like,

669
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:17,594
Oh, honey, that has been tried.

670
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:21,956
It's just the games that you have played that are popular don't use it.

671
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:22,496
Exactly.

672
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:28,259
And it's like, again, we need to have more of that celebrating like,

673
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,761
hey, remember when we all used to puke because of this thing?

674
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:35,443
Because new people that are coming into this

675
00:34:35,623 --> 00:34:38,805
this new industry don't have that background yet.

676
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,226
Oh, my gosh. Speaking of.

677
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,626
What a great segue.

678
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,907
The next generation.

679
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,788
It's like we talked about this before.

680
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:51,099
I think what you're bringing up is really important and you know what

681
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,143
what Robin and I both do at the university level is trying to think

682
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:59,448
think through a lot of these things and think through how can you solidify

683
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,791
things that aren't solidified and how can you teach students how to do things

684
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:04,253
in a way that's meaningful and applicable.

685
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:05,434
Yeah.

686
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:09,600
teach them how to take risks. I mean I think one of the things that's great

687
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,382
terrible about being like a VR developer or an AR developer or a mixed reality

688
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,523
developer right now is that there's not a lot of money to be made.

689
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:19,884
Like it's not a huge industry right now. You're not like

690
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:24,766
the number of sort of huge hits like Grand Theft Auto style

691
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:28,248
installs you know that you're gonna get like it's virtually zero.

692
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:33,353
Like, you don't have to be in this industry pretending that you're the one that's going

693
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:36,436
to make all the money because suddenly you're going to discover something that blows it

694
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:36,976
out of the water.

695
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:39,079
You know, the install bases are what they are, right?

696
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:44,344
So that takes one of the layers of like faking it till you make it out and then you can just

697
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:46,647
really be faking it and be like, well, uh.

698
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,409
Maybe it'd be cool to, like, slice through music.

699
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,070
I don't know.

700
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,771
Give it a shot.

701
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:52,211
Let's do that.

702
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:56,014
And I tell this to my students all the time, like, you're definitely not going to make

703
00:35:56,054 --> 00:36:00,838
any money with what you make unless it's a, you know, it'll be a black swan as they say

704
00:36:00,938 --> 00:36:01,298
if you do.

705
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:02,199
So, hey.

706
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,921
Do the thing that feels exceptionally interesting

707
00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:09,944
and strange to work on that you wouldn't ever be able to do if you worked

708
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:14,447
at a company and had to pay people.

709
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:18,150
And now's the time. Just do it. You've got three, four years where you could do

710
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,091
anything you want.

711
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:22,353
You could smoke a lot of weed and watch Game of Thrones or you could make

712
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:22,893
Beat Saber.

713
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:26,576
You know? You choose. You know? Maybe you could do both.

714
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:28,357
Yeah. I was like, 4K Nostos.

715
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:34,221
Yeah, I remember being at a fireside chat that you did at oculus connect this year

716
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:38,584
And I remember a student came up and asked like this exact question. They were like I'm working on this game

717
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:43,046
How do I make money and you were just like you don't don't try to make money

718
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:49,090
you're a student do something that you're really passionate about and if if you're really passionate about it that will

719
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:54,188
something cool might come out of it. Well, and if you have the privilege to be a student in one of these programs,

720
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:56,650
which is like, it's a huge amount of privilege, like

721
00:36:57,671 --> 00:37:01,013
you're already in a situation where you're developing skills,

722
00:37:01,154 --> 00:37:04,556
you're creating relationships, you're experimenting, you're learning your own

723
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:05,297
throughput, like

724
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:09,020
that in and of itself is such a privilege, right? Like I am...

725
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:16,044
I listened to a recently, On Being, which is one of my favorite podcasts,

726
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:21,668
listened to the interview with Teju Cole, who's like a fantastic photographer and poet.

727
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:24,630
And he said something really interesting to me, which I think is relevant.

728
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,292
He said that if you're a person living today and you're like awake, you know.

729
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,592
You're experiencing kind of a level of constant rage,

730
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:34,454
just by how shitty everything is.

731
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:39,779
And the reason that Teju does the work that he does

732
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,461
is because he can.

733
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:45,223
It's because he has the privilege to have hope,

734
00:37:45,503 --> 00:37:46,264
was the way that he put it.

735
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,265
And I thought that was amazing.

736
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:49,947
The privilege to have hope.

737
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,509
This room is filled with people with the privilege

738
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:54,891
to imagine a hopeful future for VR,

739
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:56,892
to imagine an accessible future.

740
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,317
and to educate the next generation with that capability,

741
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:03,459
which is like, that's pretty awesome.

742
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,179
So it's not like you're just saying,

743
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,141
here's the VR, learn how to do it.

744
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:10,342
I think what our programs try to do is,

745
00:38:10,842 --> 00:38:13,763
hey, wouldn't it be cool if you were an ethical,

746
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:16,605
integrated, intersectional creator

747
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,426
who was thinking about this as a human problem, right?

748
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:22,207
Which is, I guess it's a little woo, but whatever.

749
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:26,208
I do sort of the similar thing but with jokes and shitposting.

750
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:30,030
So I do, it's true, I do a panel at PAX,

751
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,111
which is sort of like the different, another way of doing it. It's called you VR or VRnt,

752
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:38,132
which is a, it's a

753
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:41,933
thing that Andy Moore was caught saying in a roundtable interview for

754
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:46,055
Steam. So, but anyway, so I took that. And basically the whole idea is like pitch

755
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,495
the worst VR ideas to each other.

756
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,431
And it sounds really shitposty and awful, but it's actually supposedly...

757
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:52,191
It's good.

758
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:55,813
It's basically we all pitch our worst ideas to each other and then we riff on it until

759
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,993
they're truly garbage.

760
00:38:57,773 --> 00:39:01,134
And then what we start doing is we invite the audience, and I always do these at consumer

761
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:05,275
shows, it's usually PAX, and they come up and they give us their terrible VR ideas and

762
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:06,676
then we riff on it with them.

763
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:10,557
What this does is kind of in this weird sort of subversive way, it's like trying to onboard

764
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:15,538
people into like VR ideas and welcoming them into the joke and welcoming them into...

765
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:19,062
have this conversation with us about like what works and what doesn't.

766
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:22,786
Early VR, I'm sure we all heard this, what I really want

767
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,251
oh, what's the, can I use a different one? No I can't. What I really want is Skyrim in VR.

768
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:30,934
And I tried to tell them I don't think

769
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:32,236
you want

770
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,400
that, I think you want something and I know you're looking for like

771
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:41,143
a larger more immersive world but what you're looking for is not necessarily

772
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:41,323
this

773
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:44,765
Skyrim is very empty, it's made for games right? It's made for games, it's long

774
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,906
walking distance like there's a lot of stuff to change here

775
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:50,607
and then you get into the like you don't know what I want, you can't tell me what

776
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:50,988
I want

777
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:55,632
You know, and then it's like, because that's you talking down to people in some ways, but

778
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:59,555
like trying to bring them in and educating them and bringing people into this thought

779
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,377
process about VR and then they can riff on it.

780
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:03,038
And it's always a ton of fun.

781
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:08,643
And by the end they have sort of a greater understanding about VR and what works in this.

782
00:40:09,384 --> 00:40:11,284
But it's not just, it's not cheap to get started.

783
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,464
You can just get some assets and put them in a room

784
00:40:13,504 --> 00:40:15,305
and then put the headset on and walk around in it

785
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:16,565
and like, then you're in VR.

786
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,786
Like, Everybody's Sad is a game that came out of my program.

787
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:22,507
And it's a game where you walk around a room

788
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:23,967
and all the objects in it are sad.

789
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:26,367
It's really great.

790
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,788
You open a drawer and there's like a sad toothbrush.

791
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:30,028
Aw.

792
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:31,909
Just like bummed out.

793
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,829
And you're like, you know, just like, it's about being sad,

794
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:35,149
right?

795
00:40:35,169 --> 00:40:37,010
But like, it's funny, you know?

796
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,370
It's just interesting.

797
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:38,770
Am I?

798
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,533
when they were like, we're going to make a game of virtual objects that are overly depressed.

799
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:45,415
I was like, sounds awesome. Yeah, do it. Give it a shot.

800
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:49,277
The other thing that I'll say about this, about education specifically,

801
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:52,279
and this is something we talked about a lot at the convening, is, and

802
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,401
for us working at the university level, is that

803
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:59,124
education related to immersive technology or even just

804
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:02,646
computer programming, game engines, 3D, is something that

805
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:07,170
almost no one gets to touch until they arrive at a university.

806
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,351
unless you're in a very, very privileged community that has dedicated government

807
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,371
funding to buy

808
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:16,073
computers. There's a public high school in my region that has

809
00:41:16,093 --> 00:41:19,194
a Unity lab. Wow. That's amazing. It's amazing.

810
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:22,535
It's like the best place I've ever been. I was like, I want to come here. Because you're giving them the tools

811
00:41:22,695 --> 00:41:26,116
early so they know that that's a tool that they can use. Yeah, it's aspirational.

812
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:26,957
It's aspirational.

813
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:28,037
But those are really rare.

814
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:30,538
Those are really rare moments.

815
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,560
But I think this kind of hits on all of this is,

816
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,462
there are opportunities for all of us

817
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,623
to be involved in those processes.

818
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,204
So I go twice a year to that high school

819
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:45,787
and review student projects, mentor a student, give a talk.

820
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,668
And that is not something that is recorded or publicized.

821
00:41:49,817 --> 00:41:52,779
I'm talking about it right now, but it's not like a glamorous thing.

822
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,683
It's not. I'm on the stage at VRDC at GDC. It's like, no,

823
00:41:56,783 --> 00:42:00,507
I'm at a high school in the suburbs talking to a bunch of really weird kids.

824
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:05,472
I've done it for like small, like day camps and stuff like for various

825
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:06,032
populations.

826
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,714
It was great. I was just like,

827
00:42:08,174 --> 00:42:10,717
I can't wait to talk about game development for girl scouts.

828
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:16,821
This panel is mostly a list of things that we're doing that we're like, don't you want to do these things too?

829
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:19,763
But, I mean, seriously,

830
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:23,585
I can guarantee that in most of the areas where you live there is a high

831
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,207
school program that would really love to hear from you

832
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:30,429
as someone doing this work and that that's where really meaningful change

833
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,472
happens at a systematic large-scale level with a lot of people involved

834
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,813
in very small places.

835
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:37,994
It's funny because like...

836
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:41,019
You can use technology to fix lots of problems.

837
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:45,126
I have a friend whose child had really intense early onset

838
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:47,070
diabetes.

839
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:49,534
And they developed a bunch of technologies

840
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:50,696
that work with the Apple Watch.

841
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:54,062
so they can monitor their child's blood sugar level at all times.

842
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:59,647
And that's created a community of people that are working at being parents and having lives

843
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:02,209
around children that are really at risk.

844
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,474
Those kinds of ideas happen when you're faced with a challenge in your life and then you

845
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:07,954
engage.

846
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:12,858
if you have the idea that you can just hack something and fix a problem,

847
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:16,781
you can make a huge impact on the world. And this is a place now where

848
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:17,121
you can

849
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:20,623
you can get a store asset for free,

850
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:24,226
you can put it in a world and put the headset on and see it. As long as you have access.

851
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:28,829
It's that simple in some ways. There are really easy ways to do this.

852
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,591
And it's just as simple as reaching out to a high school locally and saying,

853
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:34,774
can I bring my PSVR by and show them Beat Saber,

854
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,675
show them this Unity thing that I made.

855
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:39,117
It's not that hard to do and they will love you.

856
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,638
Like you will change their lives.

857
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:42,559
Literally.

858
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:43,079
Oh, yeah.

859
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:49,864
Introducing them also to like GitHub and being like, oh, by the way, this is literally repository

860
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:56,488
upon repository upon repository of free code and like with some of them nice documentation,

861
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:57,209
usually not.

862
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,530
Please write better documentation.

863
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,271
Please.

864
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:02,892
I'm begging everyone in this room.

865
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:07,175
I'm like, hey Addison, remember when I used to tell everyone to write documentation?

866
00:44:07,195 --> 00:44:09,256
Hey, I got Microsoft.

867
00:44:09,276 --> 00:44:11,077
Because I was like, it was insane.

868
00:44:11,097 --> 00:44:13,618
I was just like, we should be writing documentation all the time

869
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:16,599
and sharing it with each other internally as well as externally.

870
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,961
But it's very fun because I'm like, I'll go on GitHub and be like,

871
00:44:20,141 --> 00:44:21,782
oh, this is great. How do I use it?

872
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:27,883
nothing. So it's like cool, but the great thing about GitHub too is that you can say,

873
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:33,245
oh I figured out how to use this thing that had no documentation, do a pull request that is just

874
00:44:33,325 --> 00:44:37,747
documentation to that thing and be like, hey dude I wrote up how to do this with a cool example,

875
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:44,510
please integrate, thanks. But like that will help kids be like, oh it's free,

876
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,871
I can just drag this into Unity, the free assets, like the asset store.

877
00:44:48,482 --> 00:44:52,645
great resource, just like going online and being like royalty free asset.

878
00:44:53,246 --> 00:44:56,689
The other education thing is when you do demo in locations that are not,

879
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:59,472
they're not normally going to see these things, you know,

880
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:03,355
like take it to a party, a birthday party, whatever, like give normal people,

881
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:07,839
muggles, you know, access to this technology. Cause you have it.

882
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,900
If you have it at home,

883
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,564
like how many of you have a VR headset at home that you could take somewhere

884
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:12,744
else?

885
00:45:13,448 --> 00:45:17,830
See, that's a lot of you already, right? I know that's not everybody, but it's still a lot.

886
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,452
How many of you have grandparents that live in retirement communities?

887
00:45:21,612 --> 00:45:25,114
It's like a handful of people, right? There are so many places where if you took

888
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:29,076
some really cool new exciting technology and showed it to people who've never seen it before...

889
00:45:29,616 --> 00:45:31,818
When I had my grandfather, who at the time was 94,

890
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:37,661
try Tilt Brush. It was like the first time in my life that I've seen him like

891
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,422
completely just...

892
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:43,003
not, no, there was like no stone.

893
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:48,225
It was just, he was just like a little boy drawing in light.

894
00:45:48,785 --> 00:45:49,726
That is worth everything.

895
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:51,466
Like if you don't wanna do it for the good,

896
00:45:51,506 --> 00:45:53,427
just do it to like see the like bright eyes

897
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:55,448
on people's faces and the screaming,

898
00:45:55,488 --> 00:45:57,969
like the wonder and the joy and the delight.

899
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,609
Like, oh my gosh, I vicariously lived

900
00:45:59,629 --> 00:46:02,090
through every single person who I put in VR

901
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:02,631
for the first time.

902
00:46:02,651 --> 00:46:03,291
I'm like, I remember.

903
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:04,731
I remember this moment.

904
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:05,951
I remember that.

905
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,552
I remember having that moment.

906
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:09,292
I've had so many people that I put in demo.

907
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:10,772
I love demoing because they come out

908
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:13,133
and they just look at me, especially first-time users.

909
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:15,573
They're like, did you see what I was doing?

910
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,713
And I go, yes, I saw what you were doing.

911
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:19,814
And then they were like, it was like real.

912
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,754
Like, it's not real, but it was real.

913
00:46:23,154 --> 00:46:24,435
And I'm like, let's sit down.

914
00:46:24,475 --> 00:46:26,195
Here's a couch, let's sit down.

915
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:28,455
Let's talk about this.

916
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:29,135
Let's unpack.

917
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:31,016
It's really magical.

918
00:46:31,036 --> 00:46:31,636
And like every time.

919
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:35,659
every time you get the opportunity to do that like that's just a personal like

920
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,481
just hobby. It's a good hobby.

921
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,944
We could rant all day. Isn't VR great?

922
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:44,247
Yeah so we're gonna stop there and

923
00:46:44,727 --> 00:46:49,192
leave some time for questions. If you have a question you can come up to the

924
00:46:49,232 --> 00:46:52,235
microphone and we'll stick around and do that for a little bit and

925
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:53,956
make sure to get your zine on the way

926
00:46:54,196 --> 00:46:57,139
out. There's some red-shirted people with zines

927
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:57,780
for you.

928
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:00,184
Go ahead.

929
00:47:00,844 --> 00:47:01,125
Hi.

930
00:47:01,145 --> 00:47:01,945
Hi, humans.

931
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:03,245
My name is Katie.

932
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:04,806
I lead the AltSpace team.

933
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:08,127
So I'm wondering, what would you give advice to for people

934
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:09,327
working on social communities?

935
00:47:09,888 --> 00:47:11,168
You talked a lot about how people interact

936
00:47:11,188 --> 00:47:12,449
in a VR environment, but what about when

937
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:13,189
you interact with people?

938
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:13,609
Yeah.

939
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:19,671
So the question is, what advice do we have for interacting in social spaces in VR?

940
00:47:20,692 --> 00:47:24,136
We talked a lot about the fact that having standards across all these platforms would

941
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:27,880
really help, and specifically being able to sort of enforce boundaries.

942
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:33,647
A lot of what I think about in VR spaces and this kind of social engagement

943
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:36,329
also because I work on a social game,

944
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:41,452
is the fact that you really want to be able to sort of say yes or no to someone.

945
00:47:41,532 --> 00:47:44,234
You want to be able to say, like, I appear to you this way,

946
00:47:44,254 --> 00:47:45,614
and you want that to be safe.

947
00:47:46,015 --> 00:47:48,957
And I think Timony was really great at representing this stuff.

948
00:47:49,017 --> 00:47:51,778
I think a lot of the work that she's been doing at Unity is related to this.

949
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:59,546
notion that you should have ownership over your data and your profile and you should be able to control how it's used by different applications and

950
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:03,850
just the basics of setting boundaries and sharing space is something that a lot of people

951
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,253
are going to need to do a lot of work on until we come up with the right solution.

952
00:48:07,414 --> 00:48:10,136
So that's like, you know, square one, just like

953
00:48:10,717 --> 00:48:14,580
it's really important to be able to feel safe in that space.

954
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,184
I'll just say really quickly, I think the biggest thing for me with most social VR is that it is

955
00:48:19,484 --> 00:48:26,710
it's a really difficult space to curate and to moderate and as the user base has grown in the

956
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:32,315
last couple years, especially with PSVR and more affordable Windows headsets that get a lot of

957
00:48:32,495 --> 00:48:33,897
like young boys.

958
00:48:34,657 --> 00:48:36,660
running wild in social VR.

959
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,301
They're rowdy.

960
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,023
It's a pretty scary place.

961
00:48:39,063 --> 00:48:40,966
Like, I get terrified.

962
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:45,334
of just there's just like a group of 13-year-old boys just like chasing me around

963
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:47,375
and I'm just like I'm just like I I'm done.

964
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:49,917
Where did all these money the bees come from?

965
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:52,979
Also real quick, South by Southwest we

966
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,642
I also had a talk with a bunch people and one of them was from high-fidelity Liv

967
00:48:56,702 --> 00:48:57,502
Erickson she's great

968
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,905
working at Mozilla now but she was like consent

969
00:49:01,425 --> 00:49:05,688
based tools like bake it into any interaction with multiplayer

970
00:49:06,028 --> 00:49:09,471
if you bake it into the beginning tool set of what you're creating

971
00:49:09,831 --> 00:49:14,594
then it's not like a, oh, we have all of these issues and we don't have a system to easily

972
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:20,518
integrate or modify or build upon in the future. It's like if you have the system in the gameplay

973
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:24,840
system already embedded into whatever else you're doing, it's so easy then to be like,

974
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:29,003
oh, we have a mute button. Oh, we have a bubble button. Oh, now we have like block. Oh, you can

975
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:32,725
use this hand gesture. So like build the tool set and then share.

976
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:36,462
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Sarah too.

977
00:49:36,502 --> 00:49:38,623
Yeah, Rob Koster gave a really good talk last year

978
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:41,224
about all these issues as well, looking back at MMOs

979
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:43,105
and early social design in MMOs

980
00:49:43,165 --> 00:49:44,645
and how it's all really relevant now.

981
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:45,326
It's a great talk.

982
00:49:45,446 --> 00:49:46,306
Oh yeah.

983
00:49:46,406 --> 00:49:47,847
Okay, we'll take one from over here.

984
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,188
Hello, I show what buildings look like

985
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:52,448
before they get built using VR.

986
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:54,489
Yay! Heck yeah, heck yes.

987
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:55,049
Very cool.

988
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:56,390
I get to do a lot of demos

989
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,671
and I also get to a lot of watch of VR noobs

990
00:49:58,711 --> 00:50:00,491
like try VR for the first time.

991
00:50:01,171 --> 00:50:02,452
So it's like really awesome.

992
00:50:02,552 --> 00:50:02,792
Bye.

993
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:09,357
Also, I found that, you know, de-gamifying things has been a big challenge and also coming at it

994
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:13,901
from that game designer perspective. So I wanted to see what your thoughts are and like sort of

995
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:18,825
where you think the industry is moving towards for like the best experiences for people both,

996
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:23,408
you know, that can walk around a room and that, you know, are paralyzed. So what do you think is

997
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:26,891
the best like technologies coming up and how would you design using them?

998
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:31,438
I'm really excited about the Quest because it has no cables.

999
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,083
And on the projects that we work on with Oculus,

1000
00:50:35,143 --> 00:50:38,528
both for the Quest and also for the Rift,

1001
00:50:38,929 --> 00:50:40,531
we spent a lot of time thinking about seated

1002
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,895
versus standing and one-handed and all that stuff.

1003
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:47,036
I'll be honest with you, a lot of people are leaning into the same stuff.

1004
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:52,057
Like a lot of people are leaning into the sort of the super hot style experience, which

1005
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:57,419
is, you know, or Beat Saber, you know, which are high action and high aggression as a result.

1006
00:50:57,459 --> 00:51:02,860
Like the very first time I showed Luna to a woman over 50, she was awesome.

1007
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,761
She played the game for like two hours straight basically and at a frame rate that was not

1008
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:07,021
great.

1009
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,761
And I was like, what's your thing?

1010
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:10,962
She's like, well, VR.

1011
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:13,002
And then she stopped and she said, actually, I can't say that.

1012
00:51:13,562 --> 00:51:15,603
She said, I've only had one other VR experience,

1013
00:51:15,623 --> 00:51:17,183
so I shouldn't characterize all VR by it.

1014
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:18,143
I said, which one was it?

1015
00:51:18,163 --> 00:51:20,584
And she was like, the one where the music attacks your face.

1016
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,144
Oh, wow.

1017
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:24,044
And I was like, oh, yeah, that one's really popular.

1018
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,045
Yeah.

1019
00:51:26,965 --> 00:51:30,666
So I think that chill experiences, like Bri and myself,

1020
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:33,106
I think there are several lady designers that

1021
00:51:33,146 --> 00:51:36,107
are interested in Tendon Befriend games, and collection,

1022
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:37,987
and growing stuff, and chilling out.

1023
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:38,987
Luna's a chill game.

1024
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,990
There are people that are working in that space, but I wish there were more of you,

1025
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:43,811
to be totally honest.

1026
00:51:43,831 --> 00:51:44,992
Yeah.

1027
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:48,835
So you said how to de-gamify it, and I just want to be very clear about one thing in particular,

1028
00:51:48,915 --> 00:51:53,359
is that actually game developers are really great for VR because we look at interactions

1029
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,441
a lot, and VR is all interactions.

1030
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:59,725
So that's why we're kind of really good at this whole thing, and why we're going into

1031
00:51:59,765 --> 00:52:01,927
VR and why we're so good, is because we think about...

1032
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,388
how people interact with the technology.

1033
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:07,670
Now, that said, I'm also very, very excited about Quest.

1034
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,052
But I also wanted to mention I was on a panel at OC5

1035
00:52:11,112 --> 00:52:14,054
this year with Josh Straub with the Dagger system, who

1036
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:15,034
does a lot of accessibility.

1037
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:18,456
And he actually has one really valid point,

1038
00:52:18,496 --> 00:52:21,118
which is that the controller systems that we've been using,

1039
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:22,418
and the touch controls and things,

1040
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:24,640
they make your hand conform.

1041
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,044
to these controllers. So while the Quest is fantastic in terms of the lack of wires and

1042
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:34,388
you know we can do a lot of things in terms of content, we do need hardware developers to also

1043
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:39,232
pay attention to people of various ways of interacting physically with these controllers

1044
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:44,256
and systems. And the more we focus on like games and high action and the hardware developers are

1045
00:52:44,276 --> 00:52:47,879
building controllers and hardware for that, like it does come with its own.

1046
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:52,863
back. Even just the very first Oculus, like if you had black hair you just couldn't get the thing

1047
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:56,346
on your head. Oh yeah. You know, like I had two developers on my team that would like have to

1048
00:52:56,386 --> 00:53:00,569
like do all the stuff just to get the thing big enough, you know, to go over their hair and it's

1049
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:04,413
like the stuff like that, you know, like there we have problems on a fundamental level with some of

1050
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:05,013
the hardware. Yeah.

1051
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:26,129
I mean, just a quick note too, and there's been a little bit of talk about this if you already see in general, but as legislation starts to change, like it has for the web, where if you have, if you run a certain type of organization, you have accessibility standards that you must meet, you are obligated to do that by the government, or you can be sued.

1052
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:33,491
And I think as VR moves more towards a mass-adopted, public-scale application,

1053
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:39,512
I think we'll see standards, at least for certain kinds of applications, become stricter.

1054
00:53:39,752 --> 00:53:43,473
I actually like looking at a lot of the ADA-compliant stuff for buildings and things,

1055
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:46,354
just to sort of give me an idea of how I'm making a space and what...

1056
00:53:46,654 --> 00:53:50,615
So much research has gone into space design for people of various abilities,

1057
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:51,955
and I can learn from that.

1058
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:58,560
all my own new research. There's a lot of research, especially in VR for beaches.

1059
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,844
Yeah, architecture has been around for thousands of years, you guys. We need to hire more architects

1060
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:08,248
into this space because they literally thousands of years of learnings and designs of how to make

1061
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:13,772
spaces for people to work together, to be in spaces, to look beautiful.

1062
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:18,255
All right. Kat mentioned that there were some ideas that... Hi, Kat.

1063
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,165
There were some problems that we shouldn't be solving right now and that we should be

1064
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:24,386
prioritizing other things.

1065
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:28,831
I was curious if each of you have different perspectives on what are those visible problems

1066
00:54:28,871 --> 00:54:33,076
that aren't important to be addressing and where should we be shifting our focus to address

1067
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:34,097
the things that are urgent.

1068
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:36,991
I have a somewhat unpopular opinion.

1069
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:38,573
I'm totally happy.

1070
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:42,297
A lot of people are talking to, like, and ask me, they're like, oh, we have to put in

1071
00:54:42,317 --> 00:54:42,958
best practices.

1072
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:44,720
And they're trying to do that now.

1073
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,045
And so this is, so we're talking about like the pinch thing, like the pinch gesture.

1074
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,247
And yes, we want to get that.

1075
00:54:51,427 --> 00:54:55,532
But to try and put together best practices right now is a mistake.

1076
00:54:56,412 --> 00:54:59,774
We are not done experimenting and especially when we're talking about all of these new

1077
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:03,857
people coming in behind us, if we put out best practices docs, this is how you teleport.

1078
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:06,138
And they're like, okay, that is the way you teleport.

1079
00:55:06,198 --> 00:55:09,660
And then it does become not the best practice, but the only practice.

1080
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,221
People stop experimenting and looking.

1081
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:14,603
So I'm very much like, not best practices.

1082
00:55:14,623 --> 00:55:16,925
I think for me, I was in a...

1083
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:22,833
panel yesterday maybe and this is just me I'll disagree with somebody at GDC

1084
00:55:22,873 --> 00:55:23,253
that's cool

1085
00:55:23,994 --> 00:55:26,775
but the idea that we need AAA content

1086
00:55:26,935 --> 00:55:30,037
to move towards mass adoption and AAA games

1087
00:55:30,337 --> 00:55:30,777
I'm just like...

1088
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:37,929
It's just, in my opinion, those are not the killer apps of immersive technology.

1089
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:42,350
The killer applications are social, they're creative, and they're weird.

1090
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:47,311
Because being a human is really weird, and this is a really human technology.

1091
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:50,552
Traditional gaming is not a human technology.

1092
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:56,553
It is a sedentary, isolated endeavor where you control things like this.

1093
00:55:56,873 --> 00:55:58,473
That's not what it means to be.

1094
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,122
out and engaged and engaged.

1095
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:04,066
I mean, I play a lot of games, so don't take that.

1096
00:56:04,106 --> 00:56:08,872
But I think this idea that we need AAA games to make VR work,

1097
00:56:09,072 --> 00:56:10,434
I'm just like, I don't know.

1098
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:11,115
I don't think so.

1099
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:13,488
Yeah, I mean, if you think about the adoption profile

1100
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:14,989
of something like a phone, like what

1101
00:56:15,029 --> 00:56:17,610
was it that made people want to buy an iPhone, right?

1102
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,471
It was that you could have a better MP3 player, kind of.

1103
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:21,131
Right?

1104
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:23,432
Like, the thing that I always talk about is like,

1105
00:56:23,572 --> 00:56:26,253
I would really love it if I had a pair of glasses that

1106
00:56:26,273 --> 00:56:26,953
showed me where to go.

1107
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:29,534
Like, I just don't know where I'm going all the time.

1108
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:31,615
Like, just this week, I mean, I'm

1109
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:33,415
sure you can all imagine what my calendar looks like.

1110
00:56:33,495 --> 00:56:36,576
It's like, just even figuring out where my next meeting is

1111
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:38,657
from here is going to be a pain in my ass, right?

1112
00:56:38,697 --> 00:56:40,277
Like, if I could just pop on a pair of glasses

1113
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,278
and it told me where to walk.

1114
00:56:41,558 --> 00:56:45,441
I would do it. I'm not saying that the technology doesn't have its problems and that there aren't

1115
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,464
massive volumes of science fiction written about the world that that becomes,

1116
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:53,787
but we better solve it rather than just letting Apple implement it.

1117
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:57,309
You know what I'm saying? Like this is one of the things that will happen is that if we

1118
00:56:57,329 --> 00:56:59,030
don't have active conversations about

1119
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:02,773
non-best practices and all the stuff we're talking about is one

1120
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:07,697
company will just sit on the one thing and then suddenly

1121
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:09,037
we'll all have iTunes.

1122
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:11,972
In your face, you know?

1123
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:15,396
And like, I'm not, that's totally a diss on iTunes,

1124
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:17,538
but like, you know what I'm saying?

1125
00:57:17,778 --> 00:57:19,520
Like some little cabal of designers

1126
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,682
should not be designing the future of the world, right?

1127
00:57:21,782 --> 00:57:23,984
And so I think that like, the things

1128
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:26,086
that you don't want to engage in are like,

1129
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:27,748
this is gonna blow up the market,

1130
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:29,170
or this is gonna blow up the market.

1131
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,771
What you really want to be doing is thinking about

1132
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:33,134
whatever you're building, whatever weird thing that is.

1133
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:36,575
What are the two or three things in it that make it interesting and easy to use?

1134
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:38,955
Because that's going to revolutionize the way things go.

1135
00:57:38,995 --> 00:57:43,316
So it's not like areas so much as your focus should be really, really about making the

1136
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:44,396
best thing you can make right now.

1137
00:57:44,456 --> 00:57:44,596
Yeah.

1138
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:48,637
One of the problems specifically is like people are like, what Robin said earlier, I want

1139
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:49,137
to make money.

1140
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:51,498
It's like that's not a problem you should be solving right now.

1141
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:52,898
We have other problems.

1142
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:57,859
Like making money is dependent on like us getting a foundation, us eventually figuring

1143
00:57:57,939 --> 00:58:00,959
out how to build worlds well and in a social way.

1144
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:02,260
Yeah, it's a loss leading industry for a while.

1145
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:02,400
Yeah.

1146
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,422
that other problem of, oh, now that we have all that,

1147
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,043
what is the killer app, how do we make money?

1148
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,184
Okay, that comes after, but it's also like,

1149
00:58:09,524 --> 00:58:10,645
okay, not how do we make money,

1150
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:13,127
but then how do we fund other people?

1151
00:58:13,507 --> 00:58:17,110
So shifting from this question to that question.

1152
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:17,870
Yeah. Okay.

1153
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:20,292
I think we're gonna have to cut questions there.

1154
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:20,853
We'll, oh.

1155
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:21,933
No, I was just sad.

1156
00:58:22,013 --> 00:58:22,694
I was like, oh.

1157
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,935
I was just sad.

1158
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:25,436
But we'll stick around for a couple minutes.

1159
