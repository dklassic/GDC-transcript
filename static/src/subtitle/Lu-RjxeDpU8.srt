1
00:00:03,976 --> 00:00:07,224
Okay, so, this is a talk titled,

2
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:09,129
Idle Games, the Mechanics and Monetization

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,272
of Self-Playing Games.

4
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:13,264
So let's get right into it.

5
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:14,525
A quick introduction.

6
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:18,549
I've been at Kongregate for about six years,

7
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,531
directing our browser-based virtual goods business.

8
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:25,695
Also recently picked up production for a mobile game

9
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:26,776
called Adventure Capitalist,

10
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,138
which actually just launched about two weeks ago.

11
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,221
And we'll be talking about that quite a bit in this talk,

12
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:34,203
as it is also an idle game.

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,153
I also founded a studio called Level Up Labs.

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,635
And we're probably best known for our game Defenders Quest

15
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:43,936
and are currently working on a sequel.

16
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:45,877
Kongregate.

17
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:48,459
We are, if anyone is not familiar with us,

18
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:50,601
an open platform for browser-based games

19
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:52,642
with a variety of technologies.

20
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:53,923
Basically anything that runs in the browser

21
00:00:53,963 --> 00:00:55,163
we're happy to support.

22
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:57,145
We have around 16 million.

23
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:58,165
That might be a slightly old number,

24
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,787
but somewhere around 16 million monthly unique visitors

25
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:01,287
worldwide.

26
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:05,531
Our demographic tends to be more of a core gamer demographic

27
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,492
than you usually think of with browser-based games.

28
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:10,034
Heavily male, average age about 22 years old.

29
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,417
Popular genres are more MMOs, RPGs,

30
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:14,898
collectible card games.

31
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:17,700
Not really as much of the casual and social games

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,781
that you might see on other sites.

33
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,344
We have a platform-level currency called Creds

34
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:23,885
that you can spend in our free-to-play games.

35
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:26,367
And we were acquired by GameStop in July of 2010.

36
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,592
We work with a variety of partners that are both

37
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,373
western and eastern, big companies, small companies,

38
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:37,254
have all published through us,

39
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:38,915
or distributed through us on the web.

40
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,136
We also, in the last about year and a half or so,

41
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,056
have become a mobile publisher.

42
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,217
And these are some of our games,

43
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:48,898
we have quite a few more that are out now

44
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,078
and regularly launching.

45
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,019
So that's kind of our core business.

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,840
So, that's the good background of where

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,881
a lot of this data's coming from.

48
00:01:58,193 --> 00:01:59,995
So I want to open with a question for the audience.

49
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:02,817
How many of you have played Cookie Clicker or some other

50
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:03,357
idle game?

51
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:04,438
Can you put up your hands?

52
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:05,078
All right.

53
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,161
I want you to leave your hands up if you have played what you

54
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,943
would describe an embarrassing amount of it.

55
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:14,394
Alright, a lot of hands stayed up for that, thank you.

56
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,217
So that gives us three interesting pieces of information.

57
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,719
One, almost every hand went up for the first question.

58
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,380
These are very popular games, they're well known,

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,161
a lot of people play them.

60
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,843
Two, a lot of hands stayed up for playing

61
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:26,505
an embarrassing amount, which means that people

62
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,126
play them a lot and keep playing them.

63
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,309
And three, there is this sort of self-shame around them.

64
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,510
People don't usually talk about playing games

65
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,132
an embarrassing amount if it's like a really great game

66
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,693
they're proud of, but there's this weird thing

67
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:37,854
about idle games.

68
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,156
So I want to kind of dig into all of that.

69
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,562
So this is a game called Number.

70
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,645
It was a kind of a spoof parody game Tyler Goyle created.

71
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:48,567
You want to make your number go up.

72
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:49,868
It goes up a certain speed.

73
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,989
When you can afford more, you make it go up faster.

74
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,731
It's boiled down to the most minimal level.

75
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,613
And yet, this is actually kind of compelling.

76
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:59,155
I played this an embarrassing amount, to be frank.

77
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:00,736
So why is that?

78
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,057
What is it about this genre?

79
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,440
And why are we talking about this in the first place?

80
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,284
Well, for one, it's a birth of a new genre.

81
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:08,568
We don't actually get to see that very often in the games industry.

82
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:11,012
Probably the most recent one prior to this was maybe MOBAs,

83
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:15,280
to see like kind of a legit new genre coming and becoming very popular.

84
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,077
It's only about two years old in its modern form.

85
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:23,121
And it is very popular. Right now this is a screenshot of the top most played

86
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:27,144
games on Kongregate in the last thirty days and three of those top five are idle games.

87
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:29,085
It's so popular

88
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,848
you actually can watch Twitch streams of self-playing games.

89
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,189
Like, the guy's not even playing this. He's just

90
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,392
running it through his browser.

91
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:42,114
But it's, like, six people are actively watching this, 2,500 people have favorited this

92
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,576
channel of a self-playing game without even a person there.

93
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:47,829
They have fabulous retention stats.

94
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:48,849
We'll look at some specific ones,

95
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,030
but these are some of the best retaining games

96
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,431
on all of congregate.com.

97
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,232
And they actually generate really great revenue.

98
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,113
The ARPUs, the lifetime values of these games,

99
00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:00,894
are well above most single player games that we have,

100
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:01,734
and actually are competing

101
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:02,835
with a lot of our multiplayer games.

102
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,856
Also, for those taking pictures,

103
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:07,096
we'll post these slides on our website as well,

104
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:08,417
so you're welcome to take pictures,

105
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:11,358
but if you miss some, please don't worry about it.

106
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,719
They'll be available afterwards as well.

107
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:18,531
So I want to do a quick survey of the history and evolution of

108
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:20,992
idle games to understand how we've gotten to where we are.

109
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:24,495
Probably the first one was Progress Quest by Eric

110
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:25,055
Fredrickson in 2002.

111
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:28,517
This was a parody of MMORPGs, and it was basically a

112
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,379
character sheet that just ran itself.

113
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,020
It's a zero player game.

114
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,502
You cannot interact with this, even if you want to, outside

115
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:36,383
of the character creation, which doesn't have any impact

116
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:36,703
on the game.

117
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:42,111
uh... it's you know so much so that the uh... wikipedia page kinda cheekily puts

118
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,734
quotes around the word game throughout it

119
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,098
it's not really interactive in any way but

120
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:49,825
it's still kind of people it was still popular how many people have played progress quest?

121
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:52,150
Right, okay, this is not a game you can play.

122
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,131
But that many people are aware of it and have played it.

123
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,413
So already we were seeing something interesting happening.

124
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:58,994
Kongregate in particular actually ended up being

125
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,015
sort of an early breeding ground for idle games.

126
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,337
And I think the main reason is that we have a chat room

127
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,698
that plays next to the games.

128
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,799
And you can only be in chat if you have a game running.

129
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,441
So there was this demand for games

130
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,782
that people didn't actually want to play,

131
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:13,543
they just wanted to be in chat, but you had to sum it up.

132
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,724
So we started seeing games, the oldest one

133
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,005
that has an idle tag is a game called Kongregate Chat.

134
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,309
It was made just so you could chat and not really be playing a game.

135
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,954
Not long after that, that was 2007, 2008, we started seeing some rudimentary RPGs appearing.

136
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,958
Nowhere near the complexity of what we see in current idle games, but already this idea

137
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:34,602
of a game that mostly plays itself with very little interaction was starting to occur.

138
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:40,037
In 2009, probably our most popular early idle game was a game called Anti-Idle.

139
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,538
And this game got crazy.

140
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:42,859
It was incredibly complicated.

141
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,000
It had active elements and idle elements.

142
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,001
It's actually really different from current idle games,

143
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:50,624
but it did a lot of pioneering work in that concept.

144
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,065
Tons of content.

145
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,367
It's six years old, and they are still adding new features.

146
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,248
Literally yesterday, he pushed out an update to it.

147
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,511
So it's an incredible game and has been really popular for a very long time.

148
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:06,565
Cal clicker is one of the ones that got a lot of media attention.

149
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:10,287
Ian Bogost was trying to really poke fun at Farmville and other

150
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,049
appointment games and social games.

151
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,311
And so the idea was you got this cal, you would click it,

152
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,013
then you have to wait six hours and then you come back and click it again.

153
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:20,595
And by click it I mean one time, you only get one click per six hours.

154
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:21,816
And that was about it.

155
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,236
You could invite some friends, and if they clicked on their

156
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,476
cow, you got some moony.

157
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:29,337
And that was the entirety of the game.

158
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:33,738
And much to Ian Bogost's surprise, it really caught on.

159
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:35,819
And he ended up adding some more features to it and

160
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,339
growing out a little bit, but still trying to champion this

161
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,420
idea that social games and farm games are silly, at least in

162
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:41,820
his opinion.

163
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:48,836
A quick mention, they're a bit different, but A Dark Room and Candy Box are, you know,

164
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:50,117
idle games in many ways.

165
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:53,020
There was a lot of progress that would happen without active interaction.

166
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,363
But they actually are a bit different from most of what we're talking about now.

167
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:57,765
They are finite, they can be beaten.

168
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:01,148
They're a lot more puzzle-like and exploration-based.

169
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,390
They're great games and I definitely recommend them if you haven't played them.

170
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,993
But they are a little different from where this talk will be going.

171
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,504
So cookie clicker. This is the one that really kicked it off.

172
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,785
It was actually a parody of candy box. And got really

173
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:18,887
popular and Orteo was quoted as saying at first I couldn't tell

174
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,187
if people were just going along with the joke or if they were

175
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,688
actually being serious. It turns out they were being serious.

176
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,629
There was something, even though it was funny and you kind of

177
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,689
enjoyed it, there was something extremely compelling about the

178
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:31,690
system that he set up for it. And I forget what the number

179
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,211
was, but a ridiculous number of players played this game and

180
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,191
continued to play this game.

181
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,312
It was the first major mainstream hit of the genre,

182
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:40,093
arguably creating it.

183
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:41,974
So this is why I'm saying it's two years old,

184
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:43,874
is this is where it really came into its modern form.

185
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:48,356
And it really established a basis for the progression,

186
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:50,577
for the upgrading, for all of these tropes that we see

187
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,858
mimicked in most of the current idle games,

188
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:55,879
this was the game that really brought those into mainstream

189
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,580
and kind of solidified them.

190
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,137
Adventure Capitalist was a kind of an experiment by Cody Veague

191
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,318
who worked at HyperHippo Games.

192
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,200
And it turned out to be really popular in HyperHippo

193
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,521
then put more people onto it.

194
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,763
But it's really a parody of capitalism in idle games.

195
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,825
You notice I've been saying parody a lot.

196
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:15,506
This is sort of a genre that almost doesn't want to exist.

197
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:17,368
It's a joke really.

198
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,770
But it keeps, despite itself, being really successful.

199
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,152
And so you actually see a lot of humor in a lot of these games.

200
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:25,153
And that's a reason for it.

201
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:29,906
It was one of the first that I'm aware of to introduce offline progress.

202
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:32,327
So unlike cookie clicker where you had to have it running your browser all the time,

203
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,008
this one would calculate the time between your last login

204
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,689
and just give you credit for everything you would have earned.

205
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,749
This was really freeing.

206
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,490
Now you don't have to dedicate your CPU to watching, you know,

207
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,691
little pointers clicking a cookie.

208
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,912
You could just close it down and come back the next day.

209
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:47,892
And I think that was actually a big advantage for it.

210
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:50,093
And it's now actually standard in most idle games.

211
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,454
And it was also just really fun to look at.

212
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:54,234
There was a lot of animation, bars filling up.

213
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:55,295
Everyone loves bars filling up.

214
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,495
So it was really compelling.

215
00:08:59,376 --> 00:08:59,936
Clicker Heroes, 2014.

216
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:03,717
This is one that was a lot more RPG-like.

217
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:10,099
You hired heroes, you leveled them up, you gained skills,

218
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,560
and your power was measured in DPS, damage per second.

219
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,220
They added the addition of cooldown skills.

220
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,301
Again, this added some strategy and action elements to it.

221
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,142
And it had really great visuals and presentation.

222
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,363
And that's, they didn't actually put all that into the idle game.

223
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,224
This was all repurposed assets from one of their MMORPGs.

224
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,725
But it made it one of the best looking idle games of the time.

225
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,807
And then Tap Titans is not by PlayStores,

226
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,828
but is kind of a close derivative that you may have seen on mobile

227
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:38,469
that is very similar to Clicker Heroes,

228
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:40,810
but did a really great job kind of bringing that into mobile.

229
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,021
Alright, almost done with the history.

230
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,563
Make it rain was probably the first big mobile success.

231
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,806
And a lot of that I think was just this hilarious concept.

232
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:51,267
You'd sit there and you'd flick your finger over it

233
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,809
like you're making it rain with dollar bills.

234
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:54,670
And it was very viral.

235
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,851
A lot of word of mouth.

236
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,293
People just wanted to show each other this great concept.

237
00:09:58,313 --> 00:09:59,654
And I think that helped it really take off.

238
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,196
The idle elements were actually really limited.

239
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,737
You could only collect so much money

240
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:06,259
and then you'd have to come back in to get it.

241
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,241
And it would stop collecting once you got to a point.

242
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:10,837
So you had to really check in regularly.

243
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,798
I had a very aggressive ad strategy where ads were popping up all the time.

244
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,958
Because you're doing this motion, you'd actually click on them.

245
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:19,899
It was very clever, but I think it actually probably wore down the players a fair amount.

246
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,979
It was kind of annoying too.

247
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,740
So I'm sure it was a great success for a while, but I bet it hurt their longer term retention.

248
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
I don't have the data to prove that though.

249
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,581
And they also had this pretty brutal FBI monetization.

250
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:31,981
So the FBI would occasionally show up, they would declare you guilty.

251
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:36,384
And you would lose not only a hunk of cash, but actually a hunk of your cash per second.

252
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:38,246
Which in an idle game is a really big deal.

253
00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:42,549
And you'd have to bribe them with real world money to not lose that.

254
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,272
And that's, that's, that was, I think that's actually what kind of like stopped me from playing the game.

255
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:51,095
Once I hit that, that was such a negative thing that it, I just didn't want to go on.

256
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,297
So that's a very, very aggressive monetization strategy.

257
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,158
It may have worked well, but again I think it hurt the long term.

258
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,992
Bitcoin billionaire was another great mobile game.

259
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:00,893
Apple loved it.

260
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,514
It has really nice style, tone, and the topic

261
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:04,795
was fun and very current.

262
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:06,997
Presentation is really good.

263
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:09,218
Just kind of general design is really nice on it.

264
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:11,080
And one of the best things about it is it's opt-in ads.

265
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,162
This was one, a lot of times people cite Disco Zoo

266
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:14,902
as great opt-in ads.

267
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,744
This one, I think, also is really worth studying.

268
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:17,524
If you're ever going to be working

269
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,466
with opt-in ads on mobile, look at the many, many ways

270
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:20,927
that they do it.

271
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:21,947
And we'll actually look at a few of them

272
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:22,628
later on in the talk.

273
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:24,929
But it's something that Bitcoin did really nicely.

274
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,033
They similarly to MakeItRain had really strong bit,

275
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:29,695
I'm sorry, appointment mechanics,

276
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,177
very limited offline progress,

277
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,778
and it was actually offline progress

278
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,460
is one of their central monetization elements.

279
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,182
I think this was actually a mistake on them,

280
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,966
and we'll talk about why a little bit later.

281
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,568
Two quick notable entries that aren't really as well known,

282
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:46,630
but DripStat is really just a cookie clicker clone,

283
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,731
but it had amazing visualization.

284
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:52,394
You could really understand what was contributing to what.

285
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,355
It has a global live leaderboard,

286
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:56,096
so if you look in the top left area here,

287
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,356
I can see my global ranking,

288
00:11:57,396 --> 00:12:00,258
and every time I drip more bytes into the machine,

289
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:02,039
I'd actually seen my rank move up.

290
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,101
And there's actually even real time contributions from other players.

291
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:07,762
So you can see this plus one gigabyte from user, you know, whatever that is.

292
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:10,863
That's not me, that's someone else that has just done that in real time.

293
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,784
So even though it's a single player game, you get this feeling that you're playing in

294
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:14,685
a world with other people.

295
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:17,786
And that was something that I haven't seen done much in idle games, and this one did

296
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:18,286
really nicely.

297
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:22,308
And the other one I want to mention, Swarm Simulator, has only been out for a couple

298
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,288
of weeks, at least on Kongregate.

299
00:12:23,308 --> 00:12:25,289
I'm not sure where it started earlier than that.

300
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,787
It explores a new kind of funnel-based economy,

301
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,228
so they're actually playing around with a different way

302
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:31,328
of doing the idle game economy,

303
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:32,169
so that's really interesting.

304
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:33,930
Even though it's only a couple weeks old,

305
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,191
it's proving to be extremely popular.

306
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,631
So in the last couple weeks, it's been played

307
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:38,012
a million times on Kongregate alone.

308
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,694
So I think we actually probably will see this one

309
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,435
catching on a lot.

310
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:44,055
You probably will hear about it if you haven't already.

311
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,296
I definitely recommend checking out it.

312
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,537
It's really nice, even though it's, like a lot of these,

313
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:48,638
just sort of a glorified spreadsheet

314
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:49,959
with some really neat mechanics in it.

315
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,000
So, speaking of idle game core mechanics,

316
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,181
what makes these games so interesting?

317
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,122
What is unique about them compared to most other games?

318
00:12:57,284 --> 00:13:01,847
Progress without interaction. This is sort of the most basic thing about idle games is where they get their name, right?

319
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,091
And I should say, I'm saying idle games, you'll often hear incremental games used as well.

320
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:09,194
If you hop on Reddit, you can get into a very long argument about this.

321
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:13,157
I'm going to use them fairly interchangeably and not address that debate.

322
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,261
So, progress without interaction. It's a low-pressure experience.

323
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,844
You don't have to be constantly playing. If you go away for a while and you come back,

324
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:23,106
that's okay, you got some stuff, you can keep going.

325
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,809
It's a very kind of positive growth, positive feedback.

326
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,870
Everything is going up, right?

327
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,371
There's no loose conditions.

328
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,252
You might not go as fast as other people,

329
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,832
but you constantly feel like you're making progress.

330
00:13:36,013 --> 00:13:37,694
And quick check-ins can be very profitable.

331
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,454
Every time you check in and you buy a couple of things,

332
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:42,616
it shifts up your curve so that you're gaining faster.

333
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:44,276
And then you go away for a while and you've actually

334
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,537
made a lot of progress even with a very short check-in.

335
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:49,418
And this is really good for social and especially mobile.

336
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,440
interactions when you're looking for that like I want to pull it out for a

337
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,621
minute make a couple decisions and put it away this type of system is great for

338
00:13:56,641 --> 00:14:03,424
that so what this actually does is it creates a celebratory moment every time

339
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,926
you come back to the game so and a lot of these will actually call it

340
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:10,467
explicitly so let's say like welcome back you just earned a ridiculous amount

341
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:15,069
of money you should spend it and so it creates this positive feedback of oh man

342
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,610
I just came back I get to spend all this stuff this is a lot of fun

343
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,895
and beyond that, the longer you're away, the bigger the reason to return.

344
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,217
So if you've been gone for a week or so,

345
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:28,961
you don't feel like in some games you've fallen behind, here you've actually gotten ahead, right?

346
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,983
And if you go back, you're going to have even more money to spend.

347
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:35,127
And so, you know, here where I was gone five hours instead of a day,

348
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,049
I get a lot more being gone for a day.

349
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:41,104
So forced appointment mechanics I would actually say are unnecessary.

350
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:45,506
Players naturally want to come back because of the way the system works.

351
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,048
And that's a really kind of magical thing.

352
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:52,530
So even daily rewards I don't see used in these games.

353
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:56,613
And maybe they could be, but the fact is they don't really need it.

354
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,214
Because the retention is already off the charts.

355
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:01,735
So here is a chart of retention.

356
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:05,215
D1, 7, I think, 14 and 30.

357
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:06,735
Or no, 30 and 90, sorry.

358
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:09,016
The actual numbers don't really matter.

359
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,676
And you'll notice our D1s look kind of low.

360
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:14,677
This is the top 10 monetizing games of 2014 on Kongregate.

361
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:17,137
The D1s look low compared to what you see on mobile.

362
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:19,198
And that's because there's a lot less friction when you go

363
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:20,278
to play a browser game.

364
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:21,158
You don't have to install it.

365
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:22,118
You just check out the page.

366
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:25,499
So what I'm doing this is to give kind of a sense of a

367
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,139
baseline of some of our best performing games.

368
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:32,383
And then, now I'm going to pop on our three idle games that have in-app purchases in them.

369
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:36,027
You'll notice they dwarf all of our other best performing games.

370
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,070
So, the retention is amazing on these games.

371
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,671
There's something really special happening there.

372
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,916
And that's again, without data rewards, without saying you have to come back to check in,

373
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:48,639
without any kind of forced mechanics to bring players back.

374
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:55,167
Another core mechanic is the rapid growth of costs and power and rewards in the game.

375
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,273
So this leads to a sense of progress. It's psychologically fun and satisfying.

376
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:01,997
That's what number was, right? Your number is going up.

377
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,821
We like collecting things. We like advancing. We like improving ourselves.

378
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,101
and these really, really get into it

379
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,482
and do it as sort of a ridiculous level.

380
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,682
Adventure Capitalist actually writes out the words fully

381
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:13,683
and you end up sort of speaking a new language

382
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:14,443
as you play this game.

383
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:17,924
If you learn what the next multiple of a thousand is called

384
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,904
the duo quadra gentilian,

385
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:22,545
that actually starts to make sense to you

386
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:23,245
as you play the game.

387
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,545
Other games will just flat out use scientific notation

388
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,386
because the numbers are just getting so outrageous.

389
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:30,487
But it's also just really fun to have that kind of growth

390
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:31,407
and it's a sort of a level of growth

391
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:33,207
you don't usually experience in games.

392
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:35,733
We actually couldn't even, for Adventure Capitalist,

393
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,239
the game center leaderboards don't support numbers that big.

394
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,108
We had to take a log, a logarithm just to record high scores.

395
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,968
So the core loop of these games is you log in,

396
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:50,970
you spend all your cash, and then you log out and you come back a few hours later and do it again.

397
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,271
Now, that sounds kind of familiar.

398
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,913
That's what we see in social games and in energy games, right?

399
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,514
You get a certain amount of energy, you spend it all,

400
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:01,795
and then you leave and the energy comes back,

401
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,356
and then you go do it again.

402
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:07,998
But the difference is energy games are this forced mechanic that's put on top of the core game.

403
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:13,050
While with idle games it has this sort of natural energy system

404
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,734
without the need for an energy currency.

405
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:18,887
And this ends up being a lot more palatable to players,

406
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,689
and especially kind of like the core gamers who

407
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,311
rebel against the social games and the Facebook games.

408
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,354
We find that they really are perfectly

409
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:27,535
happy with this kind of a setup.

410
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,536
And I think there's a few reasons for that.

411
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:30,878
It has a real world analog.

412
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:31,859
It makes sense, right?

413
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,581
Like you're not dealing with lightning bolts that are just

414
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:35,522
kind of like added onto it.

415
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:36,743
It's like, oh, I'm out of cash.

416
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:37,824
I can't buy anything else.

417
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:38,745
That makes sense to me.

418
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,447
So I'm just going to come back later when I've got more cash.

419
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,408
Additionally, the player takes ownership over this decision.

420
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:45,188
The game is not saying, you can't do anything else.

421
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,069
It's, you could sit there, you could wait and actively play it

422
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:49,869
and probably buy something in five minutes or so,

423
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,970
but you as the player say, I could wait,

424
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,470
but my time's more with Wild in this,

425
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,450
I'm not gonna sit here and watch this,

426
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,391
I'm just gonna come back later.

427
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,971
And so it overall is a,

428
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,491
it's just sort of a better experience,

429
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,132
a cleaner experience, and one that comes out

430
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:02,673
of the natural mechanic rather than something

431
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:03,693
artificially put on top of it.

432
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,137
It also counterbalances offline play.

433
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:11,139
So you get big rewards, but those rewards grow linearly.

434
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,421
And so time actually loses value without interaction.

435
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,462
So let's take a look at what that means.

436
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,126
So here is a curve, this is an exponential growth

437
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,227
where it's saying across the bottom

438
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:24,168
we have like game sessions.

439
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,790
And basically, in this case I'm roughly assuming

440
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,291
game sessions are kind of a once a day thing.

441
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:31,912
And every day you get about 10x as powerful as the previous day.

442
00:18:31,972 --> 00:18:35,472
And that's totally normal in idle games, if not even a little slow.

443
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,413
It's also impossible to read like this, so we're going to do a log scale instead.

444
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,414
So we can make it a little more linear and understand it.

445
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:46,355
So now if you're playing once a day every day, under this kind of rough approximation,

446
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,395
then your daily progress is going to be right in line with that.

447
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:53,296
Now if you were to play on the first day,

448
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,336
and then wait seven days and come back,

449
00:18:56,577 --> 00:19:00,620
On that, you know, a week later, instead of having the, this is a little weird, but

450
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,023
on your second game session, if you're playing every day, you're going to have about a hundred, you know, ten times what you had before.

451
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:09,106
Here you have seven hundred. You're gone for seven days. You've collected a hundred for seven days.

452
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:13,569
What this means though, is even though you were gone for seven days, your actual, is that showing up? Yeah, okay.

453
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,650
Your actual, um...

454
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,851
amount of cash only puts you at about where day three would be

455
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,413
for someone who is playing every day. So even though you were gone for a week, it's not

456
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,234
like you're a week ahead of people who are playing actively.

457
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:27,656
You're actually only partway to where the next session would have been anyway.

458
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:32,039
And the thing is, this keeps going. If you're gone for a month, so you're gone for 30 days,

459
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,382
yeah, that gets you up to your 3,000, but that's still only around, somewhere around

460
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,323
the day three of someone who's actively playing.

461
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:39,604
You can go away for a year.

462
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:44,486
Come back 365 days later and oh look you're sitting somewhere in the fourth session.

463
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:50,449
So what this means is that you don't have to cap off learning earnings.

464
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,790
That's why I think these forced appointment mechanics,

465
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,792
but beyond the fact that they're not necessary from a retention standpoint,

466
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:58,453
they're not even necessary from a game standpoint.

467
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,235
The math makes it, sorry I'm a math major so I think this is really cool.

468
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,936
The math makes it so that offline progress as linear progress

469
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:08,518
becomes irrelevant because your growth is actually exponential.

470
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,739
So you can let the players keep earning lots.

471
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,520
And they're going to feel great.

472
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,321
I come back seven days, I have tons of cash

473
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,401
compared to where I was.

474
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,122
But in terms of the progress of the game,

475
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:17,462
they're actually not getting that far.

476
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,183
And this gives you the freedom as a developer

477
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:21,444
to not be forcing them to do things,

478
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:23,105
to let them kind of experience it on their own,

479
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:24,906
and to let the math control the progress.

480
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:29,960
Something else you tend to see in a lot of these games is tons of goals and achievements.

481
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,865
Lots of unlocks. Adventure Capitalist has 500 unlocks right now. They're adding more all the time.

482
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:40,632
Part of this is providing moments of joy throughout the game. I mean, the core game is you're making your number go up, right?

483
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:44,657
And at some point that gets kind of boring. But if you're getting little achievements and little bursts of speed throughout,

484
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,199
that helps break it up a little bit.

485
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,282
It also gives you the ability to have moment to moment optimizations.

486
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:54,065
So you may be deciding in this example, you know, the...

487
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,467
You have one thing that you can get here.

488
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:59,130
If you get to 2,000 newspapers, you'll get times 15 on your pizza deliveries.

489
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,312
Or if you get to 2,200, you can get times 3 on your car washes.

490
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:06,295
you're making a decision now like which one should I try to go for which one's

491
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:09,877
going to be the better optimization and so you actually do have some decisions

492
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:13,600
that at least temporarily are meaningful they min max a little bit long term yeah

493
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,821
you'll be able to afford it but you're gonna be able to afford things faster if

494
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,643
you play more optimally so it actually gives some strategy to the player rather

495
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:24,467
than just number go up faster. Prestiging or new kind of new game plus anyone know

496
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:25,628
where the term new game plus comes from?

497
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,304
chrono trigger. I did not know that until I was researching

498
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:34,590
this but apparently that was the first one to ever use the term.

499
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,077
Sorry, random trivia. Now you know.

500
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:41,749
So you get to choose to reset your game to kind of get a

501
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:42,931
boost the next time through.

502
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,432
So this one's Tap Titans.

503
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:46,995
And it's not a force.

504
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:47,856
You can do it whenever you want.

505
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:48,937
But you kind of get the options.

506
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:50,299
Like, all right, now I want to do my reset.

507
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm going to get some bonus.

508
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,941
I'm going to completely start over.

509
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,203
But you're going to do it with more power.

510
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:55,644
And you're going to accelerate through the

511
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:56,485
early part of the game.

512
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:59,749
And this is really, really central to especially the most

513
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:00,570
successful idle games.

514
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:03,973
It provides a strategic decision to the player.

515
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,876
So a lot of the little min-max decisions,

516
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,217
you know, those are nice, they're fun,

517
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:08,499
and there's some opportunity there,

518
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,623
but when to reset is a really, really important decision.

519
00:22:12,003 --> 00:22:13,625
Do I reset when I'm gonna double my speed,

520
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:15,107
or do I do it at one and a half times

521
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:17,830
and try to do that repeatedly at a faster rate

522
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,173
and hope that it stacks on top more than the doubles go?

523
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,534
There are long discussions in forums about this.

524
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,416
There's a group of math majors that I'm working with

525
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:27,698
at a university that are trying to model this out

526
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:30,079
and to pick out the best strategies for idle games.

527
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,640
Like it's actually an interesting question

528
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,962
and a really good strategic opportunity.

529
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,383
It's often tied to a separate currency.

530
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,564
So in this previous shot,

531
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:41,366
you can see like you earn these, sorry,

532
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,648
relics based on your progress.

533
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:45,389
And you're only earning like five or 10 relics

534
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:46,890
despite the fact that you have some, you know,

535
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,612
octillion damage per second that you're doing there.

536
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,278
And so this actually lets you transform exponential growth back to linear.

537
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:56,822
So now you're getting back into an actual gameplay progression.

538
00:22:57,162 --> 00:22:59,666
You're sort of, you know, taking a log of your progress.

539
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:01,409
And so the players are seeing all these giant numbers,

540
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:05,274
but you as a game developer get to turn it back into something that's a bit more linear and more controlled.

541
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,998
And this also leads to a new gameplay loop.

542
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:11,441
You start getting faster and like your core loop of buying all your upgrades and getting

543
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:16,387
through it then gets, you know, wrapped around or wrapped within this idea of prestiging.

544
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,310
And sometimes you're prestiging like once a day for some of these games.

545
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:23,415
And that becomes a second, almost core loop as fast as it goes.

546
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:25,838
And players get into a rhythm and it's really fun.

547
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:31,034
So let's go back to our exponential growth curve.

548
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:31,954
We take our log of it.

549
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,516
Now in the last one, we said that your progress was

550
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:37,096
basically right in line with the power there.

551
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:40,018
But when you start doing a prestige loop, your costs are

552
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:43,139
going up that way, but your earnings are going to be a

553
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,300
little bit below that.

554
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,381
So early on, you're going to be earning above the cost, but

555
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,522
then it's going to trail off, and you're going to be unable

556
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:49,002
to progress.

557
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:54,808
This is not a hard wall. The game is not saying you have to progress, but it's going to start feeling slower and slower,

558
00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:58,471
and the player is going to be getting a little bit bored, and so they get the option to do a prestige.

559
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:04,757
Now when you do a prestige, you're multiplying, I think by three in this case, you're going to multiply your earnings.

560
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:10,143
So, boom. Now you're taking the exact same earnings line, like nothing has changed in the balance, but you've shifted it up.

561
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:13,445
And what this means is that the early part of the game is going to accelerate.

562
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:16,628
You're going to fly through that early stuff and you're going to get farther than you did

563
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:19,130
before but then you're going to start, you know, trailing off again.

564
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,693
You're going to hit a different soft wall and at some point you're going to decide,

565
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:23,813
okay, it's time to prestige again.

566
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:27,917
And you can keep doing this and you're going to keep progressing through the content of

567
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:30,319
the game but you do it in this kind of repeat way.

568
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,202
And it creates this interesting loop that's really fun for players.

569
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:38,766
It's this ladder climbing idea. Each time you're going a rung higher

570
00:24:39,786 --> 00:24:40,767
even though you're starting over.

571
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:46,592
And it gives this amazing sense of progress. It's one of the greatest rushes of an idle game.

572
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,614
As many of you know if you got into cookie clicker.

573
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,237
You do your prestige and all of a sudden you get to buy everything.

574
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,960
And it's incredibly fun. It's a really good player experience.

575
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,382
And it's a core part of the game progression.

576
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:06,287
regular updates, this seems like a weird thing to call a mechanic, I guess it's more of a quality that we've identified

577
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:14,395
but because, I think in large part, because the games are fairly simple, there's not a lot of assets, it's all just kind of like spreadsheets and balance and UI, UX

578
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:15,796
you actually can

579
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,599
iterate on it fairly quickly and what we've seen so this is

580
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:23,462
the swarm simulator release log that's like every day all of

581
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:26,304
the you know he's putting out a release with you know not just

582
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:29,086
like a minor fix like you know a fair amount and what we've

583
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:32,129
actually seen is that I think I can actually say every single

584
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:36,372
highly successful idle game on congregate has had a rapid

585
00:25:36,392 --> 00:25:38,393
release cycle of like every couple days they'll do

586
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:38,933
something new.

587
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:42,257
It's, you know, I don't know that it's necessary,

588
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:44,500
but it is a very clear observation that we've seen.

589
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,881
The players react well to it.

590
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:49,325
With math this weird, like trying to get the balance right

591
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:51,207
is really hard, so being able to iterate on that

592
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:52,188
is actually kind of important.

593
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:55,332
It's just something that we've seen over and over again

594
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:59,216
is a quality that has been a part of success for idle games.

595
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:07,126
Make it bumpy. So this was kind of interesting. This was a story from Cody Veig, who is the

596
00:26:07,146 --> 00:26:11,788
Adventure Capitalist designer. Originally he did a very smooth progression curve and

597
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:16,449
it turns out that was really boring. You know what's coming. There's no surprise and delight

598
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:22,292
associated with it. So you have your cost curve and your earnings curve and it's totally

599
00:26:22,312 --> 00:26:23,672
flat. You know exactly what you're going to do.

600
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:27,134
And so we ended up intentionally screwing up the curve.

601
00:26:27,634 --> 00:26:28,775
And that made it a lot more interesting.

602
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,535
You make it bumpy.

603
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:32,917
And you're gonna have areas of rapid acceleration

604
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:33,638
when things are going really well.

605
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,958
And then you're gonna have kind of slow parts.

606
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:36,699
And this provides variety.

607
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,500
It keeps it interesting.

608
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,301
You don't know exactly what's gonna come next.

609
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:41,082
And that's actually fun to discover.

610
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:42,543
And then when you start prestiging,

611
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:46,145
the intersection points, you know, also change.

612
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,126
And so again, you're going to have different points where

613
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:49,307
things are going to be happening.

614
00:26:49,347 --> 00:26:51,008
Things are going to be going really fast and they're fun.

615
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,449
And other parts where they slow down a little bit, and

616
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:54,390
maybe you ease off, come back a day later, and then you can

617
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:54,990
get back into it.

618
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,452
It just makes the whole process a lot more interesting.

619
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:03,849
So we have, we actually see a lot of these elements in other games.

620
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,510
Like you know, many of them are not unique to idle games.

621
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,271
So like in real time social and strategy games,

622
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:13,453
you do often see progress while gone, though often with hard caps.

623
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:18,676
So in Hay Day you're seeing your farm is growing,

624
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:19,776
but only the stuff that you planted.

625
00:27:19,816 --> 00:27:21,397
And if you go away for weeks,

626
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:24,118
it's no better than going away for however long your longest timer is.

627
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:28,480
Mafia Wars, kind of like the energy based games, same type setup.

628
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,481
And even Game of War, sorry, there we go.

629
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:32,142
Game of War,

630
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:32,202
um,

631
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,683
the, uh, you have all your earnings,

632
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:39,504
but there's also a max, um, uh, storage that you can have.

633
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:41,645
So there is still this idea of earning while you're gone,

634
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:42,806
and that's still fun for players,

635
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:44,566
but they all cap it out in a way

636
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,287
that I think misses out a little bit on, uh,

637
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,368
an opportunity there that going,

638
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:49,848
putting some math into the exponential growth,

639
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:51,309
um, could, could fix.

640
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,669
Though it would be a little bit weird in these two.

641
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:53,509
Um.

642
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:59,098
Chinese MMORPGs. So there's a current trend of becoming very heavily auto-play.

643
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,525
Players, especially Chinese players, are really really savvy at MMORPGs.

644
00:28:04,845 --> 00:28:09,812
They want to get through the early part very quickly and get to the endgame where it gets really interesting, the strategy and the min-maxing.

645
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:13,473
And they can, you know, these games even can include an AFK mode.

646
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:14,674
So this is a game called Mythborn.

647
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:19,675
Looks like an action RPG and in large part is, but if you see like it says auto path

648
00:28:19,715 --> 00:28:20,095
at the top.

649
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:22,656
Like you start playing the game and it just starts running off.

650
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:24,916
It kills people for you, then it runs back, accepts a quest.

651
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,557
Like it's all doing it automatically for you.

652
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,818
And in large part like this is like an idle game, right?

653
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:34,058
It's running on its own and you're just kind of watching it and making occasional decisions.

654
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:39,457
It's about min-maxing stats. It's about collecting equipment and putting the right things together.

655
00:28:39,477 --> 00:28:42,079
And it's really interesting. It's really deep.

656
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,982
But what we see is that Western audiences often don't react well to it.

657
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:49,524
And I think this is in large part a problem with expectation management.

658
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:52,845
you see this game that looks like an action RPG

659
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,445
and you're expecting an action RPG

660
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,306
but then you're getting this, you know,

661
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,746
something that functions more like an idle game.

662
00:28:58,046 --> 00:28:59,846
And so even players who love idle games

663
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:03,127
often don't like MMORPGs that play like idle games.

664
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:06,708
So, you know, these are interesting games to study

665
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,328
for some of the stuff that they do

666
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,469
when it comes to min-maxing, when it comes to optimization.

667
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,290
But there's this weird thing.

668
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:19,134
psychological thing where they don't necessarily set the expectations properly and especially western audiences who aren't used to it

669
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,075
can sometimes have a negative reaction to it.

670
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:22,936
And then launch games.

671
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:29,781
So I'm sure you've seen these games around where you launch something, you collect some cash and you buy some upgrades and you launch it again.

672
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:33,263
That sounds kind of familiar right? It's actually a type loop prestige system.

673
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:37,867
You know you don't actually have choice over when you're going to do your prestige. It's when you land.

674
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:39,388
But the idea is still the same.

675
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:44,954
do some, you know, your core loop, you get to the end, you've gained some resources,

676
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:47,937
you spend them, and then the next time it's like that ladder rung, you're getting farther

677
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:50,700
each time. And I think that's part of the reason that launch games are so much fun,

678
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,224
it's that same idea of continuing growth, and we just see that in idle games, it's like

679
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,828
stretched out a little bit with a little more choice, but the mechanic is still actually

680
00:29:57,868 --> 00:29:58,349
very similar.

681
00:30:00,263 --> 00:30:02,364
So, these games actually do monetize.

682
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:04,485
And I'll admit, it surprised me a little bit when

683
00:30:05,366 --> 00:30:07,027
I think Adventure Capitalist was the first one that called me up,

684
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:08,727
I was like, hey, can we put in-app purchases in the game?

685
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:11,189
I'm like, yeah, I guess, but I don't know if anyone's going to buy them.

686
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,471
I am not always right, and I was happy to be wrong in that one.

687
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,792
So what can you sell in an idle game?

688
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:20,494
I mean, really, the game is just making a number go up, right?

689
00:30:20,774 --> 00:30:21,554
How can you monetize that?

690
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,556
Well, you can sell a cash infusion.

691
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:25,177
Let's just get a burst of cash right away.

692
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:28,280
It's usually a percentage of whatever your current rate of income is.

693
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,361
That way it's always going to be relevant to you wherever you are.

694
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,763
Or sometimes they just flat out call it a time warp.

695
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,566
So you can say, all right, let's jump ahead 24 hours.

696
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:38,248
And you'll get whatever cash you would have earned.

697
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:39,869
All of your cool-downs finish off.

698
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:43,172
And that's actually kind of compelling for someone who wants to just jump ahead.

699
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,433
Maybe they're really close to something.

700
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:47,335
They'll say, oh, OK, I'll pay a dollar to get ahead.

701
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:50,037
I mean, that's a fairly common mechanic that we see in a lot of things.

702
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:50,698
It's a speed up.

703
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:54,659
You can also, some of them will sell permanent speed multipliers.

704
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:58,160
Adventure Capitalist did this where you could buy a times three multiplier that just

705
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,360
did a permanent times three on everything you earned.

706
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:04,881
Now that's fun and you accelerate faster but also because of the way

707
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:06,382
the exponential growth works.

708
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,883
This isn't quite as much, I mean it doesn't progress you through the game as fast as you might think.

709
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:16,004
So it's fun for players and they do go faster but it also doesn't completely break the game which was kind of interesting.

710
00:31:17,646 --> 00:31:20,427
The instant prestige, so usually you reset and start over, right?

711
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:23,868
But we actually see games that will say, okay, you can get all of your currency, but you

712
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:24,688
can stay where you are.

713
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:29,109
And that's very compelling for players who, especially on games that have longer prestige

714
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:32,390
loops, being able to say, okay, I'm going to collect everything and keep going.

715
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,170
That actually can be really, really effective.

716
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,051
Protection against negative events, so you know, in Make It Rain, it's all the bribe

717
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:40,791
money that can keep the FBI off your back.

718
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:44,972
In Tap Titans, you can actually lose heroes for periods of time, but you can also buy

719
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:46,113
a shield to protect them.

720
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:48,315
So that's out there.

721
00:31:49,216 --> 00:31:51,279
Gotcha system. We'll talk about this one a little bit.

722
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,742
Clicker Heroes actually has a gotcha system in it.

723
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:55,625
For those who aren't familiar with it,

724
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:56,706
this is like random draws.

725
00:31:57,187 --> 00:31:58,829
Like a collectible card game kind of thing.

726
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:01,573
And even like event currencies.

727
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:05,075
So in Adventure Capitalist, they ran a holiday event

728
00:32:05,095 --> 00:32:06,276
where you were collecting candy canes,

729
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:08,998
you could open presents, and you could actually buy things

730
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,839
that would increase your candy cane production,

731
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:11,960
that would get you more presents,

732
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,801
that would earn these unique things

733
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:15,622
that you could only get during the event.

734
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:19,684
Very similar to something like The Simpsons Tapped Out

735
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:21,225
or Family Guy Quest for Stuff,

736
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:23,747
where they have event currencies and specific things there.

737
00:32:24,227 --> 00:32:25,928
You can still apply that to an idle game,

738
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:26,889
and they have done that.

739
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:30,045
You do see banners and interstitial ads.

740
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:33,067
So Bitcoin Billionaire did this really clever thing.

741
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:34,668
I don't know how readable that is but

742
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:36,669
you know it says basically

743
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:40,051
we're going to give you a bonus if you let us show you a banner ad.

744
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:41,251
And so you say oh cool.

745
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:42,512
And you actually ask them.

746
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:44,133
It's like yes please show me a banner ad.

747
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,534
And a banner ad pops up and then you play and earn some more cash.

748
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:50,236
So the player, it's I think the only opt-in banner ad I've seen before.

749
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:51,597
You see a lot of like opt-in video ads.

750
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:58,001
When you do an opt-in ad, like an actual opt-in ad, you'll often get a short burst of cash,

751
00:32:58,081 --> 00:33:01,583
some small bit of premium currency, a brief powerful boost,

752
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:06,146
a relief of a negative status, or even like a longer term but lower boost.

753
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:10,708
A relief of a negative status, so another example from Bitcoin Billionaire.

754
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:13,889
you know, someone divided by zero, you're going to lose a

755
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:17,171
quarter of all of your bytes. So this actually feels a lot like

756
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:21,592
the FBI thing from Make It Rain, but they allow you to

757
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,613
just watch an ad to get around it. So it's still that

758
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:25,814
negative experience, but it's not nearly as punishing for the

759
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:28,135
player. It's really just saying, hey, you had a bad

760
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,095
luck, now you have to watch 15 seconds of Kate Upton.

761
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,877
So it works out, it's a little more palatable.

762
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,956
So we're going to do a couple of case studies real quick

763
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:40,661
of games that are on Kongregate that the developers very kindly said that we

764
00:33:40,681 --> 00:33:45,047
could share some numbers for. I'm only sharing per user numbers so no total

765
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,870
revenue or anything like that but at least some insight as to how games are

766
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,231
performing.

767
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:52,496
So, Idling to Rule the Gods. This is one guy who created this game.

768
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:57,843
It's not a high production game, but it definitely has some really interesting systems.

769
00:33:58,764 --> 00:34:03,630
Branched out with some new mechanics. It was at a time that we were seeing a lot of direct clones of Cookie Clicker and Adventure Capitalist.

770
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:06,433
And this did some different things that players reacted well to.

771
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:11,419
like any of them, very rapid iteration, adding tons of new stuff

772
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,482
made a lot of UI changes. So this is kind of the old UI.

773
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:18,306
The new one is not drastically different, but there are a lot of UI or UX changes

774
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:20,668
where there were more options, there were easier things for players to do.

775
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,751
Players would ask for features and he would just do it.

776
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:26,615
And the players loved that. They loved that it felt like it was growing and improving all the time.

777
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:31,239
He probably should get an art budget, but that's okay. Sorry, that was mean.

778
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,235
There are a lot of really complicated interactions in this game.

779
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:38,516
Deep, dense systems that players are digging into.

780
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,196
And that's really, really fun for them.

781
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:42,717
Crazy math that calculates your

782
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:45,018
attack as your battle, plus your creating strength over 2,

783
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:46,579
plus physical over 4, divided by 943.

784
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:51,781
Which he surfaces to the players so they can start optimizing that, right?

785
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:56,643
And that kind of depth is always going to be fun for players who want to try to min-max.

786
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:00,619
The monetization in the game is heavily focused on god power.

787
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,980
It's basically their premium currency.

788
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,441
And you can either keep the god power and use it to provide

789
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:07,582
multipliers to different areas of the game

790
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,523
or you can spend it and get permanent multipliers.

791
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:13,424
But the permanent boosts tend to be what players react really well to

792
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:15,585
in this game in particular.

793
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:17,766
They do have some temporary boosts where you can do

794
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:20,446
like a 90 minute boost or even like a boost until you prestige again.

795
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,408
And those sell decently, but it's only about 12% of the revenue.

796
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:27,431
So it's really the permanent boost or the investment side

797
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,833
that we see selling best for this particular game.

798
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:35,179
Just to share a couple of charts, this is the lifetime percent buyers on Kongregate.

799
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:39,481
The first part was some testing data, so please ignore the early part of that.

800
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:42,363
But, ends up somewhere around 1.3% buyer rate.

801
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:45,344
So as perspective, usually we see games kind of like,

802
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:47,786
you're doing okay if you're about 0.5%.

803
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,247
Good games are usually doing 1-2% purchase rates.

804
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,968
A few games will do 3% or higher.

805
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:55,871
So, it's actually got a pretty good, if not a bit above average, purchase rate on the game.

806
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,692
And the lifetime average revenue per paying user,

807
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:00,272
so this is lifetime, not monthly or daily

808
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:00,833
or anything like that,

809
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,674
but the average per paying user is sitting around $25.

810
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,435
And that's actually quite good,

811
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:07,655
especially for a single-player game.

812
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,616
A lot of our single-player games will get, you know,

813
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:11,416
$5 or $10 for, you know, a premium version

814
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:12,917
or, you know, somewhere in that range.

815
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:15,838
So to get players spending $25 on average

816
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:17,659
for those who decide to spend is actually quite good.

817
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,780
And overall leads to a pretty decent LTV for the game.

818
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:22,982
Clicker heroes.

819
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:27,124
So this one, a couple things that it does really interesting. It does a great job of spreading

820
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:30,845
value across heroes. So a lot of times all of your old investments, your older

821
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,525
things you get become irrelevant very quickly. This one actually makes them

822
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:37,726
relevant much later in the game. It keeps it interesting, keeps you kind of

823
00:36:37,766 --> 00:36:39,687
like on your toes in terms of what you're going to focus on.

824
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:46,832
The use of RPG-like cooldowns, as I said before, it provides these kind of like quick action gameplay and some strategy.

825
00:36:47,393 --> 00:36:50,535
You can see that this list of, these are the cooldowns right here.

826
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:57,220
And so you have the, sorry I can't quite read it here, but this is the one that I think gives you more damage for like 30 seconds or something and then it has a cooldown for a few hours.

827
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:58,902
And they can monetize this cool down.

828
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:00,864
Say quick, you can get your cool downs back immediately.

829
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:02,525
But it also is just fun.

830
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:04,387
Like you log in and all of your stuff's cooled down.

831
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,269
And then you decide you're going to go up to the next boss

832
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,790
and you fire them off in the right order.

833
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,993
You want the doubler to go right before the click boost that

834
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:14,196
goes then before the higher counter order.

835
00:37:14,216 --> 00:37:15,517
I don't know if I'm doing the order right.

836
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:16,938
But there's actually a little bit of strategy

837
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:20,562
behind it, which is fun for people who appeals to RPG

838
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:20,842
players.

839
00:37:22,154 --> 00:37:29,179
Their prestige system involves a currency that has a trade-off between your DPS bonus and your summoning of these ancients.

840
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,723
So you get these hero souls that increase your DPS, but you can also spend those to get these cool bonuses.

841
00:37:36,783 --> 00:37:42,867
And so it becomes this idea, not just when do I prestige, but how do I spend my prestige points, and if so, how do I do that?

842
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,788
more interesting questions for the player.

843
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,449
So again, the core loop is mostly a self-playing game,

844
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:49,890
but once you start making these bigger decisions,

845
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,730
it's actually very interesting decisions

846
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,951
for the player to engage in.

847
00:37:54,532 --> 00:37:55,472
In terms of monetization,

848
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:57,693
they have the cash infusion and the instant prestige

849
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,253
that are pretty standard in idle games,

850
00:37:59,573 --> 00:38:01,494
which are those first two that you see here.

851
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,575
Plus one ascension, you can get the hero souls right away.

852
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:07,757
But they also have this plus three random gilded heroes.

853
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:10,499
and this is one of the innovations they really brought in.

854
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,821
This is a very simple but effective gotcha system.

855
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:15,504
These are all of the heroes you can earn in the game,

856
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:17,786
and you can draw what's called a guilded hero,

857
00:38:17,826 --> 00:38:20,408
which makes that hero do plus 50% damage permanently.

858
00:38:21,129 --> 00:38:23,011
And you can guild multiple times,

859
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:23,551
so plus 100%, plus 150%.

860
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:29,556
This is fun from a collection standpoint. You ideally would want all of your heroes gilded.

861
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:38,644
And then, because you can buy multiple times, you can actually get it so that you want to still keep making purchases and getting these random gildings so that you can increase your power overall.

862
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:43,028
And because they did a good job of balancing the characters to be relevant throughout,

863
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:49,213
even if you get some of the lower end ones, those are going to be relevant to you at times as well. So this was really cool.

864
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,435
It allows for multiple purchases.

865
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:57,189
So looking at their numbers, their lifetime percent buyer ended up a good bit better than even idling through Rule of the Gods

866
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:01,150
at almost 3%. That's a very strong percent buyer rate on Kongregate.

867
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,832
And I think in large part due to the Gacha system, they actually ended up in a similar $25 ARPAPU.

868
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:13,814
So doing really well, especially with the extra buyer percentage in terms of LTVs on the site.

869
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,941
Alright, last case study, we're getting through it.

870
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,823
Adventure Capitalist.

871
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:22,205
So this really appealed to both browser and mobile audiences.

872
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:23,465
We were able to take it to mobile,

873
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,467
got some great features from Apple and Google,

874
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:28,128
which was awesome.

875
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,269
It has a really heavy use of the theme,

876
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,470
the tone, and the humor in the game.

877
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,872
So these are some of the managers you can get.

878
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:34,692
You can see like, you know,

879
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:36,954
WW Heisenberg is the car wash manager.

880
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,240
Forrest Trump runs the shrimp business.

881
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,646
And it's a Canadian game, so you have this Jim Thornton joke in here too.

882
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:46,209
For anyone that's a Tim Horton fan.

883
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:50,821
So that humor really, really resonates with players.

884
00:39:50,841 --> 00:39:52,803
They like seeing what are the names of the managers coming

885
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,324
up, what are the new upgrades coming.

886
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:58,768
And that turned out really, really nice for just some word

887
00:39:58,788 --> 00:40:01,451
of mouth and some retention, but just in general keeping

888
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:02,372
the style of the game going.

889
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:05,755
One thing that I think we did really well with it was have a

890
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:07,076
really effective ad implementation.

891
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,140
You, the player, we don't pop this up automatically.

892
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,841
The player will have a little button they can press.

893
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:14,124
And this will pop up and say,

894
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,786
hey, you're looking for a boost, you can get

895
00:40:15,906 --> 00:40:18,569
four hours times two all of your

896
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:20,051
income if you watch this ad.

897
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:21,753
And you can only watch five of these per day.

898
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:24,758
And so it fits the theme well.

899
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:26,699
Like it's very tongue in cheek.

900
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:28,960
Like, hey, you watch this for us,

901
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:29,981
and we'll do something for you.

902
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,543
We really kind of play up the story behind it.

903
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:34,424
It provides high value to the player.

904
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:36,025
You get to double your income for four hours.

905
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:37,846
It's relatively scarce.

906
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:39,487
So you're not watching ads constantly.

907
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:41,528
And so we may be leaving some impressions on the table,

908
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,969
but the players are actively making sure

909
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,670
that they can get in and watch as many of those ads

910
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,691
as possible to hit their daily quota.

911
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:57,778
Which I also think helps, you know, it's only been out for a couple of weeks so we don't know exactly, but I think it's going to help not get player fatigue around the ads to sort of limit it a little bit.

912
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:07,224
It does have some bugs and people will complain to us that they can't watch ads and I feel like there's no better way to know that we did the ads well than to have people say, hey, I can't watch your ads, fix it.

913
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:11,067
Like, okay, cool, we'll work on that, but that's awesome.

914
00:41:12,588 --> 00:41:13,649
This is our store.

915
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:17,751
And it has kind of the normal, the angel claim is the instant prestige.

916
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,373
You can buy the time 3 multiplier and they have a time warp.

917
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:23,434
The time 3 multiplier is extremely compelling.

918
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:27,137
You spend I think $2 and you get this permanent time 3 multiplier.

919
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:29,498
And that converts extremely well.

920
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:31,399
I'll show you the conversion rates in just a second.

921
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,462
but it is one of the highest buyer percentages on all of

922
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:39,467
congregate.com. You also can unlock bulk multipliers over

923
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:42,991
time. So there you see the times 3 is the highest one you can

924
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:46,614
get. Well, we actually, as you buy the times 3, you unlock

925
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,015
another one.

926
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:51,099
and it actually keeps going. So we have times 12, times 27, times

927
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,603
I forget what that one was, and then 501 is the highest one. So

928
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:58,268
players who are, especially the bigger spenders, are kind of curious like how high does this go?

929
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:01,431
And we'll have people who will go up and just kind of find out how big it goes.

930
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,514
And then they get the big multiplier and have fun with that as well.

931
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:07,258
So I said they had a good buyer rate.

932
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,938
Remember, Clicker Heroes was doing well at almost 3%.

933
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:11,499
They're sitting at almost 8%.

934
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:14,259
It's fallen off a little bit as we got some wider promotion

935
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:17,040
and played around a little bit with pricing.

936
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,840
But 6%, 7% is phenomenal in terms of the congregate

937
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,181
standards.

938
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,321
So that times three buyer rate, I think,

939
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:28,222
is an initial purchase is a really big part of that.

940
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:35,886
At the Lifetime ARPA Pooh, because it has such a high buyer percentage and a lot of people are just buying that x3, you do see the ARPA Pooh is a bit lower.

941
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:45,672
But it has been heading up as we've been doing a lot of optimization, providing some deeper spend opportunities, adding some opportunity for to engage in the holiday events.

942
00:42:46,192 --> 00:42:50,975
There was this flat period right here and there were actually no updates were added to the game. And people just stopped spending.

943
00:42:51,496 --> 00:42:56,760
as you would expect. So, you know, just like any other game, live servicing is very important to a successful idle game.

944
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,583
And you will see revenue flatten out if you're not supporting it.

945
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:05,388
In this case, they were actually working on the mobile version of it, but the web stats, you know, faltered until we started paying attention to web again.

946
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:07,510
What platform is that?

947
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,292
This is, this is, all of these charts are for congregate.com.

948
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:15,973
We were happy to see that the mobile retention has held up well so far.

949
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,874
Again, we've only been out for two weeks, so I only have so much data, but

950
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,435
D1 retention sitting somewhere around 55-60%.

951
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:26,737
So, you know, looks like the theory that good retention,

952
00:43:27,557 --> 00:43:29,358
you know, that maintained on mobile.

953
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:31,839
Our D7, again, we don't have a lot of data yet, but

954
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:33,620
that's sitting somewhere around 35%,

955
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,260
which we are extremely happy with.

956
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,021
So, yeah, they retain well on web and retain well on mobile.

957
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:43,993
Mobile ARPUPU also held up.

958
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:47,895
So this is a cohort chart of congregate data.

959
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,377
And the reason I broke out the cohorts is because we made

960
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:51,237
some monetization changes.

961
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:53,259
And so you'll see the ARPUPU is actually pretty low for

962
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:56,000
people who joined a while ago.

963
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,981
But in the last few months, the ARPUPUs have been sitting

964
00:43:58,001 --> 00:43:58,542
somewhere around $12 to $15.

965
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:03,984
On iOS we're looking at around $18 ARPAPOO right now.

966
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:06,504
On Android we're sitting somewhere around $13.

967
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:10,265
So we're seeing pretty consistent spending patterns across each of the platforms.

968
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:14,146
The buyer percentages are different because of a variety of things around friction

969
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:16,027
and having credit card access and that kind of thing.

970
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,688
But in terms of depth of spend for those who decide to spend,

971
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:21,508
it actually is relatively consistent across each platform.

972
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:27,308
Alright, and last couple. So, spender categories.

973
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:32,332
This will, you'll recognize this as a type of chart that Congregate often does.

974
00:44:34,234 --> 00:44:37,437
So we wanted to break out what spenders look like for these games.

975
00:44:37,837 --> 00:44:39,819
And so what this chart is, is that readable up there?

976
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,754
somewhat. So this is by how much they've spent. So this

977
00:44:45,914 --> 00:44:48,815
orange section here is people who have spent less than $10 on

978
00:44:48,835 --> 00:44:51,317
the game. And it kind of goes around $50 to $100 all the way

979
00:44:51,337 --> 00:44:52,718
up to these tiny little slivers of $100 to $500 and $500 and

980
00:44:52,738 --> 00:44:53,158
more on the game.

981
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,983
And so we have this chart for Clicker Heroes and Idling to Rule the Gods.

982
00:45:01,724 --> 00:45:05,907
Adventure Capitalists, remember, had a really good conversion rate.

983
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:08,569
But a lot of those conversions were at like a single purchase.

984
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:12,412
And so that's why you see that really, really big percentage of people only spending under $10.

985
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:16,776
While Clicker Heroes and Idling to Rule the Gods, I had to check a couple of times.

986
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:18,657
I thought it was the same chart, but they actually are slightly different.

987
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:22,360
remarkably similar numbers.

988
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,722
But it's interesting, it's important to look,

989
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:27,825
the vast majority are the under 10 to 50,

990
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:29,747
with just these tiny little slivers

991
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:32,449
of the 50 to 500 group in all of them, right?

992
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,311
Now, each of these games has multiple $1,000 plus spenders.

993
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:39,577
So, just like any other game, you do have big spenders.

994
00:45:40,158 --> 00:45:41,961
If you want to find out more about big spenders,

995
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,766
Carate's CEO, Emily Greer, is giving a talk about them tomorrow.

996
00:45:46,508 --> 00:45:48,070
So I'm not going to talk about them here,

997
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,834
but that's a good talk and I'll just plug her.

998
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:54,880
But yeah, so we do see big spenders even in these idle games.

999
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:59,543
But if we were to take this, so this is distribution by how many players are spent in those groups.

1000
00:45:59,963 --> 00:46:03,506
If we now go and instead look at how the revenue distribution looks.

1001
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:05,287
I'll go ahead and pop all three of them up there.

1002
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:11,712
So the small groups are contributing a relatively small percentage of the actual revenue.

1003
00:46:12,592 --> 00:46:13,793
Sorry, this is hard for me to see down here.

1004
00:46:14,513 --> 00:46:16,553
You end up seeing that the groups of the $50, $150,

1005
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:19,914
and $500, sorry, $100 to $500 and $500 plus

1006
00:46:19,954 --> 00:46:21,915
are actually contributing rather large percentages

1007
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:23,375
and actually most of the revenue

1008
00:46:23,415 --> 00:46:25,295
outside of the venture capitalists to these games.

1009
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:29,376
So just like any of the other successful games that we see,

1010
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:30,737
pretty much every successful game we see

1011
00:46:31,177 --> 00:46:31,917
through in-app purchases,

1012
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,038
especially outside of the casual,

1013
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:37,518
even in casual, big spenders drive a lot,

1014
00:46:37,618 --> 00:46:38,699
if not most, of the revenue.

1015
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:43,740
these games, they monetize, you have to live service them,

1016
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,101
the retention is very similar.

1017
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:47,881
They ultimately are just like any other successful game,

1018
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:49,342
or game as a service,

1019
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:52,423
in terms of really all of the numbers that we see.

1020
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,604
And that, you know, it's not really just an idle game.

1021
00:46:55,844 --> 00:46:57,844
They are games that are compelling and fun

1022
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,405
and work just like every other game.

1023
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,412
So just a couple of kind of like wrap ups.

1024
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:03,392
Like, you know, what's next?

1025
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:04,753
Make some kind of random predictions.

1026
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:07,374
You know, I think the classic kind of spreadsheet

1027
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:09,475
like idle game is probably going to start to lose favor.

1028
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:10,575
Players have seen a lot of them.

1029
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,416
We're starting to see some more sophisticated

1030
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:14,697
visualization and presentation.

1031
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:17,738
So, you know, the kind of like easy, you know,

1032
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:18,958
jump in and create a quick idle game

1033
00:47:18,978 --> 00:47:21,399
is probably starting to run out

1034
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:22,720
as we're seeing better production values

1035
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,681
and people will take more note of the genre.

1036
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:28,264
I think we'll be seeing idle spin-offs of games and brands.

1037
00:47:28,544 --> 00:47:32,748
Clicker Heroes, for example, was a spin-off of Cloudstone by PlaySaurus.

1038
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:36,672
There's an Adventure Quest Dragons spin-off that's actually...

1039
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:39,555
I don't know exactly what the relationship was, but when you load it up it says, like, you know,

1040
00:47:39,615 --> 00:47:40,796
partnered with Clicker Heroes. So...

1041
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,718
I'm sorry, partnered with Cookie Clicker.

1042
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,261
So somehow they worked together to do this spin-off game.

1043
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,663
And I imagine we'll see kind of more of those occurring.

1044
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,741
I think idle is going to become sort of a genre modifier like RPG. You've got your action RPG, your strategy RPG, your tactics RPG.

1045
00:47:55,221 --> 00:48:01,063
Well, you could have idle tactics, action idle RPG, idle match three. In fact, idle match three has been done.

1046
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:03,744
So this was, yeah, Puzzle Fuzz.

1047
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:07,939
which was a uh... andre pelerano is one of our internal developers and uh...

1048
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:11,600
he uh... created an idle match three games so this little bar at the top here

1049
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,242
fills up on its own and will match that color and you can interact you can play

1050
00:48:15,402 --> 00:48:18,363
faster than it but it will run on its own if you go away it'll keep matching

1051
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:18,703
for you

1052
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:21,864
and you're basically charging up these little characters that are going over

1053
00:48:21,904 --> 00:48:25,566
and trying to break their friends free from that uh... amber

1054
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:26,466
gel thingy

1055
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:31,368
uh... but you can just apply a lot of these idle game ideas to other

1056
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,128
genres just like uh... rpg

1057
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:34,029
uh... ideas

1058
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:43,420
And I think, you know, so, and where that kind of goes from there is that idle design philosophies are going to start getting integrated into the metagames of standard, of other types of genres.

1059
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,385
You know, not all of this will work. Exponential growth is going to be weird in some games.

1060
00:48:48,106 --> 00:48:49,788
But I think you gain a lot.

1061
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:53,390
from these types of energy system approaches,

1062
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,271
these types of positive progress and feedback,

1063
00:48:56,371 --> 00:48:58,952
and trying to find ways to bring that into other genres,

1064
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:00,873
I think is a good bit of where the future is.

1065
00:49:00,913 --> 00:49:02,974
And that's, I certainly would encourage everyone

1066
00:49:03,014 --> 00:49:04,415
to try making an L game if you want,

1067
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:05,855
it's fun, it's relatively quick.

1068
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:08,336
But trying to figure out how to bring some of this

1069
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:11,117
into other genres, I think is what I'd really like

1070
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,398
to see some people do, and we haven't really seen yet.

1071
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:16,116
So that's my talk.

1072
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:17,898
Here's some contact information.

1073
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:19,681
You can check out our developer website.

1074
00:49:19,701 --> 00:49:21,403
If you have browser game questions

1075
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:23,706
or mobile game questions, those are your best contacts.

1076
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,008
And then my email address.

1077
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:26,970
Cool.

1078
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:29,634
So I guess we can open up for questions.

1079
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:30,375
We have time for that.

1080
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:32,057
Thank you.

1081
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,039
Please come up to the mics if you'd like to ask.

1082
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,701
Also, just a quick shout out,

1083
00:49:43,962 --> 00:49:46,705
if you enjoyed the talk, please give me a good rating.

1084
00:49:46,805 --> 00:49:49,207
If you didn't, go ahead and fill it out

1085
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:50,288
because I'd like to at least learn from it,

1086
00:49:50,368 --> 00:49:52,711
but doing these evaluations is really helpful.

1087
00:49:53,872 --> 00:49:57,115
It helps us learn, and also, if you enjoyed the talk,

1088
00:49:57,235 --> 00:49:59,137
please fill it out because then I can give more talks later.

1089
00:49:59,258 --> 00:50:00,619
So, thank you so much for coming,

1090
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:03,001
everyone who's heading out, and let's take some questions.

1091
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:04,864
Hi, Matthew Lawrence, Rovio.

1092
00:50:05,104 --> 00:50:05,344
Hello.

1093
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:07,186
A quick question on the prestiging mechanic.

1094
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,690
So it's actually really vital for player progression in the long run, but it's actually

1095
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,936
kind of an advanced level mechanism, and it always requires player interaction to do it.

1096
00:50:15,956 --> 00:50:18,739
I've never seen one where it actually leads the player to do it, like part of a tutorial,

1097
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:21,563
and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on how to kind of really encourage players

1098
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:22,564
to get that in the Fatui.

1099
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,594
I don't know that I would get into the Fatui.

1100
00:50:26,074 --> 00:50:29,056
Like you said, it's more of a later mechanic.

1101
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:30,677
So you do want to tutorialize it.

1102
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,719
But it's something that is a complexity level

1103
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:35,300
that you don't necessarily need to introduce right away.

1104
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,162
The games are often compelling and fun on their own in the core loop.

1105
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:41,164
And so players are sort of discovering and getting into that.

1106
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:43,065
and then when it becomes appropriate.

1107
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,786
So like in Adventure Capitalist,

1108
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,048
once you get to 50 angels, you would double your amount.

1109
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:50,529
And so at that point, we pop up a little thing and said,

1110
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:52,991
hey, now would be a good time to check out the prestige system

1111
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:54,211
and kind of introduce them to that.

1112
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:57,193
So I think the best way to do it is to contextualize it

1113
00:50:57,213 --> 00:50:58,473
to when it's appropriate to the player.

1114
00:50:58,934 --> 00:50:59,794
Don't introduce it too early

1115
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:00,955
because they're not even going to understand it

1116
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,255
and they're already likely having fun.

1117
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:05,297
So I think it's mostly about sort of targeting

1118
00:51:05,817 --> 00:51:06,638
the tutorial at the right time.

1119
00:51:06,658 --> 00:51:07,858
Cool, thank you.

1120
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:10,600
Hello.

1121
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,306
Hey, so you spoke a little about how many people are buying these games and how many

1122
00:51:16,346 --> 00:51:17,588
people are developing for these games.

1123
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:22,213
What's the ratio, like the saturation, in this genre and where do you see it going in

1124
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:22,593
the future?

1125
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,572
I'm sorry, I was asked to repeat the question.

1126
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:28,034
So the question was, you know, what is the saturation of the genre?

1127
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:28,995
Where is it going to the future?

1128
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:32,638
It is starting to get somewhat saturated, especially with kind of like

1129
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,879
fast follows and clones.

1130
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,702
Those don't tend to have as much success.

1131
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:39,905
The most recent success for us has been Swarm Simulator

1132
00:51:39,925 --> 00:51:41,867
and that's one that really branched out and did something

1133
00:51:41,907 --> 00:51:43,708
very different in its approach and in the

1134
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:45,510
economics of the game.

1135
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:49,553
So, I think there is still opportunity for, I mean that was two weeks ago.

1136
00:51:49,593 --> 00:51:52,816
So obviously there is still, you know, new ideas that are coming out.

1137
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:55,739
There is still iteration that is happening and evolution of the mechanics.

1138
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:59,221
You know, it is something that is gaining attention.

1139
00:51:59,301 --> 00:52:03,905
We've had multiple games in the idle genre are getting featured by the big platforms

1140
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,747
which means a lot more people are going to be paying attention to it.

1141
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:10,970
It's a great experimentation and kind of breeding ground

1142
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,470
for ideas.

1143
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,932
And so we'll still see a lot, I think, coming out on browser.

1144
00:52:14,452 --> 00:52:15,993
It's a little harder to get big on the web

1145
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,274
because you have, or on mobile, because you have to go

1146
00:52:18,294 --> 00:52:18,974
through the app stores.

1147
00:52:19,074 --> 00:52:21,996
But I think there's still opportunity

1148
00:52:22,016 --> 00:52:23,517
for the main idle genre.

1149
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,718
And then there's sort of the second layer

1150
00:52:25,878 --> 00:52:27,359
of taking some of those approaches

1151
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:31,481
and wrapping them around, like the idle RPG or the idle match

1152
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:34,183
three, where you're kind of providing a little more

1153
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:35,583
gameplay and then trying to balance that

1154
00:52:35,603 --> 00:52:36,564
with some idle elements.

1155
00:52:38,097 --> 00:52:38,517
All right, thanks.

1156
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:38,957
Thank you.

1157
00:52:39,218 --> 00:52:40,038
Over here.

1158
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:43,679
You mentioned that these games require a lot of updating

1159
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:44,900
in order to stay fresh.

1160
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,761
Is that updating primarily on the late game or earlier game,

1161
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:53,122
or is it spread throughout the time or the levels

1162
00:52:53,162 --> 00:52:54,403
that the player will be moving through?

1163
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:55,297
Yeah, great question.

1164
00:52:55,518 --> 00:52:57,740
So the question was, there are lots of updates in these games,

1165
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,041
but where are those focused?

1166
00:52:59,061 --> 00:52:59,922
What do those updates look like?

1167
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,544
So a fair number of them are end game.

1168
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:05,487
And it depends a little bit on how long the game is

1169
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:06,488
when you first launch it.

1170
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:08,110
But a lot of times, players will get through it relatively

1171
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,472
quickly, and you do want to provide content at the end

1172
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:11,333
for those that have gotten there.

1173
00:53:12,013 --> 00:53:13,974
A lot of the updates are UI and UX.

1174
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:18,015
You don't necessarily understand how players are going to interact with the game, especially

1175
00:53:18,035 --> 00:53:19,436
the ones that get really hardcore about it.

1176
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:25,218
They'll start requesting things like, allow me to buy up to 100 of something and automatically

1177
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:28,760
determine what the right one is and then show me my cash per second here.

1178
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,180
There's a lot of requests about that.

1179
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:35,342
So a lot of them are usability things that are helpful throughout the entire process.

1180
00:53:36,982 --> 00:53:40,143
The early game often doesn't change much outside of maybe some balancing.

1181
00:53:40,263 --> 00:53:42,684
Sometimes you find that, you know, when you did the bumpy,

1182
00:53:43,064 --> 00:53:45,484
something was a bit too low, and so you may shift that up a little bit.

1183
00:53:46,605 --> 00:53:49,686
But in general, you're going to be providing either something on the end

1184
00:53:49,706 --> 00:53:50,746
or something that's a little parallel.

1185
00:53:51,346 --> 00:53:54,367
With AntiIdle, the one that's been going for like six years,

1186
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:56,127
he's actually just like adding new mechanics.

1187
00:53:56,187 --> 00:53:58,928
So rather than just doing on the end, he'll add like another way to,

1188
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:00,348
you know, now there's a little fighting game in it,

1189
00:54:00,388 --> 00:54:01,569
now there's a little collectible card game in it.

1190
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:03,029
He's kind of crazy. I don't know that's the best way to put it.

1191
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:05,830
way to go it but and he's been doing it for six years so we had to you know have a

1192
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:11,312
little bit of variety but yeah it's it's really just sort of the the games it's

1193
00:54:11,432 --> 00:54:14,313
it's one that I think minimum viable product is very very early on and so a

1194
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,774
lot of the iteration is just sort of like public beta testing and something

1195
00:54:17,794 --> 00:54:21,055
that's very easy to quickly iterate on and so that's I think a little bit of

1196
00:54:21,075 --> 00:54:24,436
what we're seeing with it. Cool thanks. Thank you.

1197
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:25,234
Yes?

1198
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:28,940
Hi, you mentioned that Congregate has games from Flash

1199
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,563
and HTML5 and Unity.

1200
00:54:31,244 --> 00:54:33,007
Is there any particular type that

1201
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:36,212
tends to be more successful or just common for idle games?

1202
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:38,475
Are they all Flash or some HTML5?

1203
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:42,947
So yeah, the question was whether there's a particular

1204
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:44,788
technology that's better for idle games.

1205
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,231
I think I can almost firmly say no.

1206
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:49,852
Adventure Capitalist is Unity.

1207
00:54:50,473 --> 00:54:52,074
Clicker Heroes is Flash.

1208
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:54,776
I think Idling to Rule the Gods is Flash.

1209
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:56,658
Swarm Simulator, I believe, is HTML5.

1210
00:54:57,578 --> 00:55:00,861
So no, we actually don't see any real requirement there for

1211
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:02,062
one tech or another.

1212
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:03,103
Thanks.

1213
00:55:03,643 --> 00:55:04,924
You're welcome.

1214
00:55:04,964 --> 00:55:05,465
Any other questions?

1215
00:55:07,147 --> 00:55:08,069
All right, well thank you so much.

1216
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,353
Again, please fill out your evaluations

1217
00:55:09,413 --> 00:55:10,156
and thanks for coming out.
