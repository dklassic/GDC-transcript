1
00:00:03,215 --> 00:00:03,795
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:06,256
Good morning everyone.

3
00:00:06,276 --> 00:00:08,157
All right.

4
00:00:08,457 --> 00:00:11,379
Now we can have our talk.

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,020
Hi.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,860
This is us.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,441
I'm Adam.

8
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:16,821
Dirk.

9
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:17,602
Will.

10
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:18,282
Chris.

11
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:27,707
And we're happy to be here and talk to you guys about our experience creating immersive VR worlds.

12
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:38,605
We've got a little introduction and then each of us is going to do less than five minute

13
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:43,347
kind of micro talk and then we're just going to have an open discussion and then we'll

14
00:00:43,387 --> 00:00:47,809
leave plenty of time at the end for questions.

15
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:57,946
Let's jump right into it. So I like to infuse music into my talks somehow all the time. And if

16
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:03,714
you hadn't picked it up, it's in the title of this talk. Use your illusion.

17
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:10,238
The epic double album Guns N' Roses, released from 1991.

18
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,582
So I thought I'd just give you guys a little Guns N' Roses trivia real quick.

19
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:18,965
Both of these albums were released on September 17th, 1991.

20
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:20,266
They both debuted at number two.

21
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:21,206
One sold 685,000.

22
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:21,467
Two sold 770,000.

23
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:34,778
The second album spawned all of the hits for this double album release,

24
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:38,422
You Could Be Mine, November Rain, and Don't Cry.

25
00:01:39,404 --> 00:01:45,691
Both of these albums represented a lyrical, songwriting, stylistic growth from

26
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:50,560
The kind of previous turning point for the band, the seminal Appetite for Destruction,

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,303
these albums had a more mature sound, despite many of the songs originating back to the

28
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:00,185
more raw Appetite for Destruction era.

29
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:07,129
Despite the global success of these albums and their tour, the double albums ended up

30
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,710
splintering and destroying the band.

31
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:15,132
Specifically alienating guitarist Izzy Stradlin, who was kind of the songwriting engine of

32
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:21,093
the group, and he left and it kind of just eroded the band.

33
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:25,814
Their next album was an album of covers called The Spaghetti Incident that no one remembers.

34
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:28,234
And then, well you know the rest.

35
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,775
I guess they're back now, kind of.

36
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,255
So cautionary tale about double albums, guys.

37
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:37,356
And excess.

38
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,278
Maybe in video games.

39
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:41,099
So that's what works.

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,703
So we're here today to talk about kind of immersive worlds and how they're achievable

41
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:50,464
in VR.

42
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:57,727
And for me and for these guys and probably for many of you out there, the first time

43
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:00,408
you put on a VR headset, if it was a good...

44
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:09,132
experience, it really kind of changed how you look at things. And we want to share our

45
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:16,317
experience making VR worlds and what we've learned and kind of what we think works and

46
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:23,842
what doesn't. But I look at something like this and it's kind of the possibility I want

47
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:30,346
to go to there. So I'm Adam Orth. I'm the creative strategist at First Contact Entertainment.

48
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:39,625
I've been making video games for a long time, and I'm starting my 18th year making games

49
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:40,246
now.

50
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:48,621
About five or six years ago, maybe even a little bit earlier, I started becoming really

51
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:57,248
bored with the traditional way of making games and the kind of minimal, medium progression

52
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:00,130
between long development cycles.

53
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,373
I was becoming embittered and just hostile towards the whole thing.

54
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,335
I just didn't want to do it anymore.

55
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:11,017
I was just searching for...

56
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,849
whatever the new thing was.

57
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,831
Like, how am I going to express myself in this interactive medium?

58
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,912
And I just didn't know what to do.

59
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:24,954
And I was just really kind of stuck in a rut.

60
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:30,117
And I started working on this game called Adrift, which is...

61
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,280
It's a VR game. If you haven't heard of it, look it up. It's pretty sweet.

62
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:41,583
But I kind of considered this moment of a career and life reset for me.

63
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:48,346
And it just started as a way for me to just try to do something new and different.

64
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:53,928
And I wanted to tell a really deeply personal story in an interactive experience,

65
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:58,670
but not through shooting someone in the face in a video game.

66
00:04:59,331 --> 00:04:59,531
So...

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,866
Around that time, right around that time, the Kickstarter for Oculus Rift happened and

68
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:14,632
my partner and I were backers, we were early backers, and we had a very basic prototype

69
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:22,059
for Adrift and we got this DK1 and we magically somehow set it up and it worked the first

70
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,041
time, which never happened again after that.

71
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:33,000
Um, and so the first time I saw this new generation of VR was with something that I was building,

72
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,121
and I just lost my mind.

73
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:41,463
It, it, like, it changed everything for me, and I realized that this was the thing that

74
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:47,984
I was searching for, and I instantly knew that I could tell the story that I wanted

75
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:51,925
to tell with this new hardware and technology.

76
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,246
It was just kind of mind-blowing.

77
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:54,366
So...

78
00:05:55,723 --> 00:06:01,744
We put those two, mashed them together, and Adrift was kind of a traditional game experience

79
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:02,785
up until that moment.

80
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:10,867
And we put it all together and then it just, everything kind of fell together for us.

81
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:19,149
Completely creatively re-energized, just totally into exploring in the dark and peering around.

82
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,291
So that little prototype in the Oculus Rift became this, but in VR.

83
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:30,051
And it was just the perfect way to really express what we were trying to get,

84
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,780
and we just had never experienced anything like that before.

85
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:39,853
Adrift, at least for us, was the perfect setting for VR.

86
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:46,696
It was this kind of seductive and universal power of space that kind of resonates with

87
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:50,758
everyone because everyone knows what space is and they have their own idea and they're

88
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:55,280
either excited by it or scared by it, but everyone has kind of a foundation to build

89
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:55,961
on and it really...

90
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,387
kind of everything is kind of lined up right there.

91
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:03,731
And it's just it took me someplace that I could never go in real life.

92
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:08,454
And and that's when I really kind of saw the power of VR.

93
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:14,459
And I became one of those kind of early adopters and evangelists for the tech.

94
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,323
And we basically worked with Oculus kind of from the beginning,

95
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,205
not in any kind of official capacity, just.

96
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,095
We loved what they were doing and they loved what we were doing.

97
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:32,324
And we ended up becoming a featured Oculus Rift launch title and that first wave with

98
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:32,845
the Vive.

99
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:37,290
And it was just an awesome experience to be part of.

100
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,756
And currently I'm working at First Contact Entertainment.

101
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,875
AAA VR studio in Santa Monica.

102
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:52,918
My role as creative strategist is to kind of guide the vision of all of our VR products and the creative vision anyway and

103
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:58,659
ensure that that kind of strategy is moving forward safely in the future and then

104
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,940
creating new new experiences as well.

105
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,182
I'm focusing now on

106
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:10,023
multiplayer VR. Drift was a very

107
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:21,345
Kind of solo, closed off experience and I want to take my passion of the virtual space

108
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:24,845
and bring other people into it and do awesome things.

109
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,086
So that's what we're doing.

110
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:29,006
Now Dirk.

111
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:45,489
Hi everyone, I'm Dirk Van Velden, I'm from Belgium, I'm the captain at iIllusions and

112
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,212
we made this game called Space Pirate Trainer.

113
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,676
I don't know, who has played Space Pirate Trainer before?

114
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,896
It's cool, it's a lot of people.

115
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:59,279
So yeah, I'm the founder and project lead on Space Pirate Trainer.

116
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:05,262
My illusions was actually we were doing work for hire for the entertainment industry and

117
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:08,303
the communication industry, so we were creating games for fairs.

118
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:13,826
And then we ended up creating our own IP like four years ago on Steam pretty early.

119
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:19,088
By that time we had some contacts at Valve and we had a Vive pretty early.

120
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,992
My current role at iIllusion is mostly gameplay programming.

121
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:29,995
I'm an interaction freak, which is great for VR, because there's a lot of interaction going on.

122
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:34,157
It's about subtleties in movement and subtleties in the way you grab things,

123
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,718
and so that makes experiences better.

124
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,243
I've been a very early VR supporter, so I was also a backer for Oculus.

125
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:46,628
But my problem was, the first thing I played on there was Half-Life in VR.

126
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,190
And I'm super susceptible to motion sickness.

127
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,896
And I just went to bed for a couple of hours and actually said to myself,

128
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:57,098
I'm never going to create a VR game.

129
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,819
So, that's something I actually said.

130
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:05,721
Two years after or three years afterwards I got noticed, I got the Vive and tried it

131
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:11,291
on and I was blown away because I wasn't getting motion sick, mainly because of the positional

132
00:10:11,331 --> 00:10:11,712
tracking.

133
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:11,772
So...

134
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:11,932
I'm...

135
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:12,012
I'm...

136
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:12,132
I'm...

137
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:12,213
I'm...

138
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:12,553
I'm...

139
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:12,673
I'm...

140
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:12,794
I'm...

141
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:12,874
I'm...

142
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:13,054
I'm...

143
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:13,134
I'm...

144
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:13,214
I'm...

145
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:13,295
I'm...

146
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:13,375
I'm...

147
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:13,455
I'm...

148
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:13,535
I'm...

149
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:13,615
I'm...

150
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:13,695
I'm...

151
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:20,372
This is one of the screenshots of 1.0 Space Pirate Trainer.

152
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:24,714
So we're creating actually environments around the current environment.

153
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:30,396
There's some more stuff coming with 1.0 which is going to release next month.

154
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,937
So it started out as a room scale demo.

155
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:36,078
So we actually made Spacefire Trainer for Vive and for room scale.

156
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:37,959
It was a free demo.

157
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,221
It was released on the forums like in December before the Vive came out.

158
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:47,003
And just because it was some, there was nothing like a shooter even.

159
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:49,845
So we had one demo with a bow and that was it.

160
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:51,766
So we just tried to create something new.

161
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:55,788
And back then the wave shooter was actually something new that no one had done.

162
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,569
And there's a lot of wave based shooters now.

163
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,611
I think Space Pirate Trainer was one of the first ones.

164
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:07,396
So was Space Pirate Trainer a success?

165
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:14,463
Well it sold more than 150,000 units, so we can only be a team of three people, so actually

166
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:18,366
for us it was also a commercial success next to being just great to work on.

167
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:25,111
One of the reasons why it became a success is probably because it's very pick-up-and-play.

168
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:29,415
You get most of the stuff immediately. You can just start. It's super easy.

169
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,218
You just have the shield in your bag that people will show you.

170
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:36,402
Someone like Dan Kaminsky on Twitter said,

171
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,705
My favorite part of Space Pirate Trainer is that you get access to everything immediately.

172
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:47,758
So you couldn't actually, if you create a game for just desktop PCs, you can't imagine a game where you get everything instantly.

173
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,959
Normally you should unlock things and stuff like that.

174
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,343
But I believe like in this first wave that we had of VR entertainment,

175
00:11:55,523 --> 00:12:01,047
it was a good decision that we just unlocked everything for everyone so people could just show stuff.

176
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:05,110
And we're trying to keep that strategy for 1.0 as well.

177
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,373
And it's very difficult because if you give everything at the same time, it gets kind of overwhelming.

178
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:15,596
But yeah, that's something you have to figure out. One of the reasons why it's very popular in VR arcades

179
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:19,799
is also the same thing. You get everything immediately and people don't have to unlock stuff.

180
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,962
This is another screenshot of 1.0. It shows a boss fight

181
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:32,506
with the boss bigger than the platform. It's pretty crazy in VR, not so much in 2D, but yeah.

182
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:33,907
So that's upcoming

183
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:35,888
mid-October.

184
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:43,983
So about environments, one of the decisions we made is we have one environment, right,

185
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:44,984
so it's very open.

186
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:51,351
The thing is you want to create an environment that people want to look at constantly, but

187
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:55,455
if you have a corridor and there's something at the corner, people would actually love

188
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:56,055
to check it out.

189
00:12:56,796 --> 00:13:00,359
If you don't have any locomotion system, like people are always in the same place and running

190
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:06,024
out in the same square meters, you have to create stuff that's interesting, but not something

191
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,645
that you have to look for.

192
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,536
You have to make sure that people aren't feeling that they're missing out stuff that's happening

193
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:13,736
around their world.

194
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:16,498
So we tried to move the action around the player.

195
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,981
Also like with the other screenshot that you saw, we actually move a spaceship or a big

196
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:22,542
spaceship around the whole platform.

197
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,384
So it feels like a totally different environment.

198
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:29,047
Just by checking and changing the stuff that you didn't, you have to use locomotion.

199
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:30,628
So that's one of the things we did.

200
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:35,932
Also the reason why the front side of Swiss by Train is pretty empty, just a city with

201
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:36,112
some...

202
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:40,557
Skylights, it's mostly a distraction issue.

203
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,760
Like if you have too many spaceships flying around

204
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,101
or if you have too much detail,

205
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,085
you actually can see the little droids flying towards you.

206
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:51,090
So you have to be careful if you're adding too much content

207
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,512
to the thing you have to focus on,

208
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:54,194
things get distracted quite easily.

209
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:57,835
Also, there is object interaction that was pretty important for us.

210
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:00,236
So people love to interact with stuff.

211
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:04,097
And if everything is at a certain distance and you can't use a locomotion, you have to

212
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,037
find some solutions.

213
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:05,937
So we had a Volton.

214
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:11,118
It's kind of a device where you can grab droid switch and you actually pull them towards

215
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:11,298
you.

216
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:16,559
We're going to even in 1.0, we're using it for powering up turrets and stuff.

217
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,620
So we're actually adding interaction with objects that are actually far away.

218
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,080
So yeah.

219
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,621
was one of the solutions.

220
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:30,545
And then the final point is, so you have, actually, Space Pirate Train is only using

221
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:33,306
210 degrees of action.

222
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,568
So most of the action is going out in front of you.

223
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,348
And that wasn't always the case.

224
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,351
Like in the first prototypes, it was just droids flying around you, and you would go

225
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:42,411
nuts because...

226
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:46,173
It just can't remember all the droids and where they are and how they're flying around.

227
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:53,075
So that was a design decision that people felt so much more secure if everything was

228
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:54,216
happening in front of them.

229
00:14:55,176 --> 00:15:00,798
So that's probably one of the better decisions we made for Space Pirate Trainer because people

230
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:05,520
that are in VR for the first time, you just don't want to overwhelm them.

231
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,122
They can look around and they can see the environment, but the action should be in front

232
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:10,342
of them.

233
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:16,088
So I think that's most of the stuff I have to say about Space Pirate Trainer.

234
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,034
I'm just going to give it over to Will Smith.

235
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:30,005
Hi everybody, I'm Will Smith. I'm the founder and CEO of FooVR.

236
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:32,527
Before that, I ran...

237
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,409
We make the FooShow, among other things.

238
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,753
The FooShow was an early prototype that we built to show how our animation technology works.

239
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,436
What we do is actually animate believable human avatars

240
00:15:45,856 --> 00:15:50,199
using the three points of data that you get from a VR headset and hand controllers, like Vive.

241
00:15:50,759 --> 00:16:00,765
The Foo Show is something where we take people and put them inside video games with the people who make the games.

242
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:06,629
We can talk about making games from inside the games. It kind of spins off of what I did at Tested before we started Foo.

243
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,172
Everybody watched this on YouTube, it turns out.

244
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:12,735
We had like 100,000 downloads across all the platforms,

245
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:16,258
but the YouTube views that some guy captured off of a headset

246
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:20,182
with full head bob got an order of magnitude more traffic.

247
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:24,186
So I think there's an important lesson about nascent platforms there,

248
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:26,068
but I don't know what it is this early in the morning.

249
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,430
I'm Will Smith.

250
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,870
I think I got in a little bit different order.

251
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,471
I'm not this one.

252
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:32,931
I'm actually this guy.

253
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,252
This is from my time at Tested.

254
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,653
The thing that we did, the thing that was really compelling was we went out and found

255
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:43,293
people who made amazing things on all sorts of scales.

256
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:48,134
From a guy in his garage making WALL-E robots that actually drove around and were fully

257
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:54,516
articulated to cooking for the International Space Station with Chris Hadfield to just

258
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,796
testing goofy stuff in the office in San Francisco.

259
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:03,419
We talked to the people who made these things in a way that was very relatable to other people who make things,

260
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,160
and people who are aspirational.

261
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,762
The challenge with it was it was only really good for tangible things.

262
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:10,983
Video is great. I can point at something, I can say,

263
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:13,424
oh, why did you make Wally's head work this way?

264
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,705
Why does this juicer have a feed like this?

265
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:20,727
If we wanted to talk to people who make games or other intangible 3D, you know, digital assets,

266
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,568
you know, it's kind of boring.

267
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:25,149
Like, hackers kind of did this thing, but...

268
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,650
Nobody wants to watch a video of somebody sitting in front of a computer typing, ever.

269
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:29,831
It's really boring.

270
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,932
So, that was kind of the impetus for the Foo Show.

271
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:36,514
I wanted to be able to take these intangible assets that people created

272
00:17:36,914 --> 00:17:39,815
for games and science and all these other mediums

273
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:43,756
and have those same kind of conversations with the creators inside those spaces.

274
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:45,637
And that's what we do.

275
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:48,678
We make these intangible places feel like they're real with virtual reality.

276
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,963
So what have we learned so far?

277
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:55,087
For human animation, believable,

278
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:57,090
it's much, much more important to,

279
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,913
you know, we're never gonna get one-to-one tracking

280
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:00,075
with three points of data, right?

281
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,166
The thing that we learned incredibly early is that if you hold your hand out,

282
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:09,811
the hand orientation we can get, but if your forearm in VR doesn't line up with your forearm in the real world,

283
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:14,055
a lot of people get really, really discomforted by that, and it's something to be avoided.

284
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:16,217
Avatars actually work.

285
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:20,321
When we recorded the first episode with the Firewatch creators,

286
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:24,385
Sean Vanaman and Jake Rodkin from Campo Santo,

287
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,442
I didn't know if you were going to be able to interview somebody with avatars.

288
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:31,904
We literally put the headset on for the first time, and we'd used the technology a lot in

289
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,626
house, but we'd all spent hours and hours and hours testing this, and we were familiar

290
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:36,206
with the avatars.

291
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,967
We were used to their body language.

292
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:39,408
We were comfortable with them.

293
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:45,852
And the first five or six minutes of the Firewatch recording, it was unclear if we were going

294
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:48,313
to be able to have the kind of human interaction that we have when we're looking at each other

295
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,415
in the eye, and you kind of read the body language that comes across when you're having

296
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,376
a conversation with somebody.

297
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,479
That's the other interesting thing is that the body language actually does come across

298
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,941
even with only three points of data.

299
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:03,965
So when I shrug, I get that reads much better in VR than it does even on a Skype call or

300
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:04,726
something like that.

301
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:11,151
If I'm tilting my head like I want more of a question, I want more detail on the thing

302
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:14,294
that the other person is talking about in a conversation, they can pick up on that and

303
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:14,894
they'll give me that.

304
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,977
If I'm moving my hand as if I want to interrupt, they'll see that too.

305
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:20,139
And all these things get lost in video.

306
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:23,461
But they're present in VR, and when you're interviewing somebody, when you're talking

307
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,903
to someone, whatever, it all transfers.

308
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,007
When you're building these VR worlds, and I think we'll talk about this more in a minute,

309
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:36,132
but being deliberate about what you make real and what you make magical is super, super

310
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:36,632
important.

311
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:42,397
You want the real stuff to behave very predictably and follow a set of rules that are, they don't

312
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:45,719
have to be set in stone, but they need to be internally consistent with the rest of

313
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,660
the thing that you're building.

314
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,502
And then on top of that, we layer some VR magic.

315
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,884
So we do what we call diegetic UIs.

316
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:56,347
Basically it's a pop-up menu that's a device that lives in the world.

317
00:19:57,007 --> 00:20:03,471
And instead of blasting up a big 2D pane with UI on it, we give people a thing that they

318
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,073
can interact with that's basically physical widgets.

319
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:10,833
And it's important to use that stuff sparingly.

320
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:16,234
When you're doing a social thing like our recording studio, if you want them to follow

321
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:22,155
the rules of the real world, not invading people's personal space, not zooming around

322
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:27,176
recklessly while you're having a conversation with them, your world needs to behave enough

323
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:31,096
like the real world that their reptile brain says, oh yeah, I know how to do this.

324
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:35,477
I stand here and I look at this person and I nod when they say something that I agree

325
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:36,677
with and I shake my head when they don't.

326
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:41,828
And then the other thing that we learned relatively early on is that the VR audience, at least

327
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:45,812
in the first year or so, wasn't big enough to pay the bills, even for a small three-person

328
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:46,332
studio.

329
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:49,755
So we started doing some other stuff.

330
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:55,480
We used our animation tech to make a live weekly television show.

331
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:01,165
It's digital, but it's essentially a 30-minute sports call-in show that features Carl from

332
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:02,186
Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

333
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:06,648
every Wednesday night at 7 and he talks about football.

334
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,889
He loves the Giants and hates everyone else, basically.

335
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,271
We've also done some commercial work and we've done a couple of other pilots that I can't really talk about.

336
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:18,513
But it turns out, building a virtual reality animation studio

337
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,854
that works like a live television studio

338
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:26,778
It empowers the people who make traditional animation in really interesting new ways.

339
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:28,979
And then I have what's next.

340
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,542
So, we're continuing to work on the animation.

341
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:38,345
It turns out taking three points of data and turning that into a believably animated human is challenging and difficult.

342
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,646
We get a little bit better every version.

343
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,488
I think we're on like the 10th or 12th version of our core software now.

344
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,130
The 2D content pays the bills.

345
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,911
It turns out it's nice to have food and a house.

346
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,312
But we still believe in the future of VR,

347
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:54,093
despite the fact that we're using VR to make 2D video.

348
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:57,075
I think that the upcoming wave of hardware that's coming,

349
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,995
the price reductions we've seen earlier this year,

350
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:01,756
and the standalone headsets that we'll see next year

351
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:06,458
are making VR, AR, MR, whatever you wanna call it,

352
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:10,460
it's all still a super relevant thing and really exciting,

353
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,080
and the place that we wanna be.

354
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,421
And the stuff that we're doing for 2D

355
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,921
actually will spill over into the...

356
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:19,295
The VR adjacent stuff.

357
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:22,915
And we really believe that the current gen desktop hardware are dev kits for the future.

358
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:26,296
I think that the standalone headsets are going to be huge in two years.

359
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:28,897
And that's pretty much it.

360
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:32,257
The last thing I'll say is that don't get hung up on labels.

361
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:33,358
Just make stuff that you think is cool.

362
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:35,978
So VR, MR, AR, whatever, it doesn't matter.

363
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,139
Just make cool games and things.

364
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:39,599
And I'll hand it over to Chris.

365
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:49,734
Hello, good morning.

366
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:57,797
I have a policy about slides with text that I don't like them.

367
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:02,039
And I made these slides and I sent them over to Adam about a week ago.

368
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,920
And I'm like, hey, what do you think of the slides?

369
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,221
And he said, yeah, yeah, they're fine, these will be fine.

370
00:23:06,882 --> 00:23:09,843
And then a couple of days ago, he's like, well, I'm having some trouble fitting them

371
00:23:09,863 --> 00:23:10,603
into the template.

372
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:14,305
Because we have a really impressive slide template here.

373
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,843
And then last night we had dinner.

374
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,505
I had to stop using the template because of your slides.

375
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,045
Because of my slides.

376
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:20,625
I broke the template.

377
00:23:21,626 --> 00:23:26,470
Then last night we had dinner and he's like, I got to tell you something, I had to rewrite

378
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,411
your slides as text.

379
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:38,580
And I was like, so I'm going to bring to you these slides that I drew with a pen that I

380
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,043
forced Adam at gunpoint to reinsert into this deck last night at about 11pm.

381
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:44,665
So I hope that you enjoy them.

382
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:49,917
My name is Chris Pruitt. I am an employee at Oculus.

383
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:54,462
My job there is working with folks like yourself, third-party developers.

384
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:59,327
I run an engineering team that helps folks like yourself optimize your code,

385
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:03,192
or design your games, or do whatever it is you need to do to make your content really good.

386
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,595
Under the cover of night, I'm also a game developer.

387
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,777
I founded a studio called Robot Invader in 2011.

388
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:15,259
That studio continues to run and my role these days is sort of to paw through the code at

389
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,119
night and introduce bugs.

390
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,302
Robot Invader produced a game called Dead Secret, which I was the designer for.

391
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:27,304
This shipped in, its very first version shipped on Gear VR in 2015.

392
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:34,127
And I'm going to talk about it a lot today, but it's essentially a murder mystery horror

393
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:34,387
game.

394
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:44,149
So here's a slide about Dead Secret and the important part of this slide is that you should go to DeadSecret.com to find out about the next game which is called Dead Secret Circle which is currently in development.

395
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:49,871
Okay, so the reason I'm interested in VR worlds is that I actually want to scare you.

396
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:52,332
I'm interested in making all of you quake in your boots.

397
00:24:53,313 --> 00:25:00,576
And the reason that I'm interested in horror games is really long and complicated and I'm going to get as much of it as I can in the 30 seconds I have left.

398
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:04,957
I started studying horror games about 15 years ago.

399
00:25:05,877 --> 00:25:08,239
These were not VR games, these were just regular horror games.

400
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,182
And my theory at the time was that horror games are interesting and they're different

401
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:17,025
than other types of titles because they are going for emotional manipulation.

402
00:25:17,425 --> 00:25:21,428
If you're building a horror game, you have a very, very specific goal, and that is to

403
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:24,950
make your players feel a very, very specific thing, which is generally stress or tension.

404
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,432
And that's more specific than most other types of games.

405
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:31,454
Most other types of games are like, oh, I feel great, I'm having a good time, the adrenaline

406
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:31,795
is running.

407
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,118
I'm a space ninja or whatever it is.

408
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:38,541
But horror games are like, no, no, I'm going to make you concerned about what's behind

409
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:40,203
that door right at this moment.

410
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:45,409
And that's a very specific type of design and I was really interested in that concept.

411
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,213
I spent a long time working on it. I don't really care when I say horror games about

412
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:54,676
like jump scares or monster closets. What I care about is an environment that over the

413
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:59,019
course of experiencing that environment you are worried about. You become unsettled by.

414
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,122
And actually what I'm going for is what horror game designers have been calling sense of

415
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:05,984
presence for a lot longer than we've had VR.

416
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:09,417
The idea of presence in VR is well understood.

417
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:13,099
You're in the world, you believe you're in the world, the world is self-consistent, you

418
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:13,939
accept that you're there.

419
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,002
And outside of VR, horror game designers work really, really, really super hard to produce

420
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:19,202
that.

421
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,443
And in VR, it's almost automatic.

422
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:27,072
And that means that a scary game, or a game, even if it's not scary, that's built on the

423
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:33,817
same principles as a horror game in VR, has the ability to speak intimately at an emotional

424
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:38,261
level with its player, really, really easily, in a way that other types of experiences do

425
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:38,461
not.

426
00:26:38,501 --> 00:26:39,682
And that is super fascinating to me.

427
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:46,807
My goal is to get you to stop thinking about the game as a collection of mechanics.

428
00:26:47,530 --> 00:27:14,003
When I play a video game, I play a lot of video games, and I kind of can see through the mechanics a lot of the times, and I'm like, oh, you know, like, the health pack gives me three health points back, but if I take a hit, then I only take one point, so I can take two hits before I have to use a health pack, and then I got to ration the health pack because, you know, I have to do three more guys before I get to the boss, and he's going to hurt me harder, and I'm, that's like solving a Rubik's Cube, and that's fun, and I enjoy it, because Rubik's Cubes are pretty good, but when you're playing a horror game, what I want you to think about is,

429
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:16,723
What is the significance of that symbol that I just saw on the wall?

430
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,264
I'm pretty sure I've seen that symbol somewhere before.

431
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:20,924
Maybe the killer left that symbol.

432
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:22,525
I want you to think about the context.

433
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:24,385
I want you to think about the story and the environment.

434
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:27,606
And that is entirely built out of what I call contextual thinking

435
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,507
rather than systemic thinking, which is normal for a regular video game.

436
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,207
That's kind of what I want to talk about today.

437
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:37,008
And I'm going to cut it off there because Adam said he'd kill me if I go more than five minutes.

438
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:40,289
But that's my piece. Thank you.

439
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,342
Okay, I need the mic gun.

440
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:50,283
Is this on? Okay.

441
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:51,924
Thanks guys.

442
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:55,626
So when I put this, the idea of this panel together,

443
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,287
I was going through a period where I was just like,

444
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:00,668
working on a new thing,

445
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:06,271
and the environment was not working in VR.

446
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,396
It was something that was kind of set in the real world that you can actually go to and

447
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:15,598
experience in real life.

448
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,182
And I just found it wasn't clicking for me.

449
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:22,585
And I started thinking a lot about environments.

450
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:24,126
I wanted to talk about it.

451
00:28:24,146 --> 00:28:26,969
And I wanted to talk about it specifically with these guys.

452
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,653
They're my friends, but I also really respect what they've done in VR.

453
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,255
So I wanted to have just...

454
00:28:36,396 --> 00:28:43,522
Even though they're kind of rote at this point, but the idea of transportation...

455
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:47,785
Not locomotion, but being transported somewhere.

456
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:49,687
Presence.

457
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:56,611
and immersion. Those things have been talked about to death.

458
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:02,695
But the kind of interesting thing here is I want to talk about those things

459
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:06,197
from, through the lens of these guys' experience.

460
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:13,521
You know, I made a very narrative-driven, environmental VR experience.

461
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:19,485
And I want to kind of hear how these guys, and have you guys hear how these guys

462
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,567
Think about those three words

463
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:30,676
from making an arcade game or a VR TV show or a horror game or and especially in Chris's point from

464
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:32,998
point of view as

465
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:34,960
an employee at

466
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:42,627
arguably the best VR headset out there. Some may disagree, but I'm an Oculus fanboy.

467
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:52,255
Because I think it's interesting, I think there's a lot of interesting stuff to be said there,

468
00:29:52,775 --> 00:29:57,397
especially from Chris's point of view, from, you know, what does Oculus look for in these things?

469
00:29:57,457 --> 00:30:06,380
So, I just want to open up, I'll start out by saying, you know, when I was working on Adrift,

470
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,501
I researched a lot of...

471
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:15,629
You know, what do people who go up into space, how does it make them feel?

472
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:20,812
How does it feel to be able to look down on all of humanity?

473
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:26,034
And they all had a really different experience and they were all very changed when they came back.

474
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:37,101
But the one commonality was that they had a sense of presence in the universe and in space

475
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:39,542
that made them feel like...

476
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:48,567
It changed them forever. And I wanted to kind of use VR to capture that in a narrative game,

477
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:53,589
so space was like an obvious choice for me. And like I mentioned just a couple minutes ago,

478
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,853
I've done some things recently where I haven't been so successful with the environment

479
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:05,335
because it's not magical enough, right? And Will brought that up a little bit.

480
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:10,818
Well, you can either be really real or really magical, right?

481
00:31:10,898 --> 00:31:11,638
You don't have to be both.

482
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:13,458
Sorry, I didn't mean to take your mic.

483
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,559
But yeah, so we take, with the Foo Show,

484
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:17,780
we take stuff from video games.

485
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,721
And there were two things that we learned really quickly.

486
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,241
One is that we have this opening segment that's

487
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,142
like 2 and 1⁄2 minutes long, where we introduce

488
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:28,003
the developers, and it's in a studio where you can teleport

489
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:30,204
around a little bit, but there's literally nothing else to do

490
00:31:30,604 --> 00:31:33,505
but watch us talk, and then watch the clip that we play.

491
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:37,687
On the other side of that, we go into the actual environment from the game.

492
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:41,549
We made all of the props that were in this Firewatch watchtower interactive.

493
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,830
So you can pick them up, you can look at them.

494
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,031
We talk about them, we pick them up, you can grab the things that we're talking about.

495
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:49,793
And the feedback, we analytics the hell out of it,

496
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:52,835
which I recommend everybody do on there, especially when you're experimenting with stuff,

497
00:31:53,215 --> 00:31:55,356
so you can see what people are touching, what they're spending time with.

498
00:31:55,857 --> 00:31:58,238
The feedback we got after we did playtesting was

499
00:31:58,838 --> 00:32:02,180
the opening part was about 10 minutes too long, it was two and a half minutes.

500
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:06,424
The second part could have been twice as long, and it was 17 and a half minutes.

501
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,888
So, you know, we had a 20-minute total experience.

502
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:14,353
The part that was two minutes and we thought was as short as we could possibly make it was too boring.

503
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:17,917
And, like, one of the things that you did with Adrift—

504
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:19,418
you did two things that I loved in Adrift.

505
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:22,081
One was, the first time you went outside the space station,

506
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:24,784
I felt like an astronaut for the first time in my life.

507
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,926
Since then, you're floating in space,

508
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:29,846
you're looking at the whole world,

509
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,988
you can see the entirety of the world below you.

510
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:35,349
And I understood a little bit more about the things

511
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,050
that I'd read in all the memoirs of the astronauts

512
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,790
I've read over the years.

513
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:40,352
It's something that connected with me very personally.

514
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,853
Google Earth does a similar thing.

515
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:44,494
When you're in space looking at Google Earth,

516
00:32:44,534 --> 00:32:45,654
you get that same kind of feeling.

517
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:50,778
But you also gave the people lots of stuff to interact with in the world, which I think is really important.

518
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:53,320
The thing that I'm curious about is with your game, Dirk,

519
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,463
like you basically, your interaction is that you can shoot stuff or grab it.

520
00:32:57,483 --> 00:33:00,806
And your game is much more, like I've spent way more time in your game than I have in mine.

521
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:10,433
So, you know, I'm curious, yeah, like, is shooting just a core, we just have to shoot as people?

522
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,585
Is that a question?

523
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,947
I mean, do we have to shoot his people?

524
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:22,951
Do you mean like, is this mic on?

525
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:23,812
Can you hear me?

526
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:24,713
Yeah.

527
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:26,495
So, no, actually you don't have to shoot.

528
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:28,256
But yeah, if I'm...

529
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:33,161
I mean, is it a core imperative of the human experience that we have to shoot other things?

530
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:34,870
I guess.

531
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:42,611
One of the funny things is with 1.0, I'm going to spoil it, you can actually finish Space

532
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:47,412
Pirate Trainer 1.0 and you do it by just not shooting the first droid because the first

533
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:48,432
droid doesn't shoot you.

534
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:53,513
So if you just hold it and caress it for a couple of minutes, you unlock the, you finish

535
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:53,853
the game.

536
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:57,594
It just, it just flies away.

537
00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:01,235
So if you ever want to unlock it, don't tell your friends, they'll go mad that you finished

538
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:01,475
the game.

539
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:04,227
So you don't have to shoot as a human.

540
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,268
It's because you...

541
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:06,909
I really wanted to do that.

542
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,070
You start the aggression.

543
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,651
So that's when they start shooting at you.

544
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,013
That's why the first droid's not shooting at you.

545
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:15,334
People were wondering why that was.

546
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:19,277
It's also easy, the first droid's not shooting.

547
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:23,199
But the interaction part with the Voltron,

548
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,142
we saw that in virtual environments, people...

549
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:31,204
tend to try everything, or try to interact with everything.

550
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:33,825
You saw it like in Job Simulator, in a lot of games.

551
00:34:34,245 --> 00:34:37,746
They try to do random stuff, and the best way to figure out what people will be doing

552
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,487
is just to playtest your environment.

553
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,969
I think the guys from Walking Me Labs, they just put people in there,

554
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:45,750
and they start throwing stuff or shaking the bottle,

555
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,672
and they said, maybe it should actually spray or something if you shake it too much.

556
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:53,733
So you can actually, you have to predict what people will do, but you can't predict everything.

557
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:56,637
We had the same thing, for example, with the Volton.

558
00:34:56,657 --> 00:35:00,142
You could actually interact with objects that were far away from you.

559
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,565
People were trying to use it on everything around you.

560
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,429
They were trying to use it for the ship to move it around.

561
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,093
You could actually use it on the grenade, for example.

562
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,014
You could pull them back.

563
00:35:09,595 --> 00:35:15,999
So one of the new things was creating more interaction around you in your world.

564
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,242
And by creating more interactivity, it also makes it more believable, I guess.

565
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:24,305
And you spend a lot of time on details that people will probably not see,

566
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:26,607
but it just makes all of it more believable.

567
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:32,571
That's a good segue for Chris, because I spent a lot of time in that house.

568
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:33,972
Yeah, I think there's a lot of...

569
00:35:34,152 --> 00:35:38,455
I mean, one of the nice things about VR, as you alluded to, Adam, is that there's...

570
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:45,021
It's new and there's no real rules and nobody really knows what the rules should be.

571
00:35:45,582 --> 00:35:48,685
Particularly, if we're talking about core video games,

572
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:52,729
if you're making a first-person shooter in this day and age and it's a core video game,

573
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:56,472
you don't have a lot of choices when it comes to how the character is going to move

574
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:58,755
or what the action button is going to be.

575
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,237
Those things are baked as precedent.

576
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:04,220
You can't mess with them or players won't understand how to play your game.

577
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:09,146
In VR, all bets are off. Nobody knows how to shoot a robot.

578
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:13,151
Maybe you should grab it with a gravity thing first.

579
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:15,755
The grammar is unwritten.

580
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:20,861
In particular, you have an opportunity with each new world to write your own grammar.

581
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:22,443
I think the trick is that...

582
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:27,314
Once you define that this is what the interaction grammar or

583
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,715
this is the rules of your world, they have to remain consistent.

584
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:33,738
So the thing that is great about SpacePirateTrainer is that you

585
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:37,000
can do all that stuff. You can use the objects in a way that

586
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,463
you didn't expect people to use. It's also true of Job Simulator.

587
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:42,824
They're saying, I'm going to give you a very high fidelity

588
00:36:42,864 --> 00:36:44,005
interaction here. We have a lot of...

589
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:49,562
We've got a lot of physics interactions. And then all the stuff you might think to do is

590
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,323
going to totally work. Because we coded it to work. You want to put your head in the

591
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:59,726
photocopy machine? We thought of that. So when we did dead secret, this was pretty early.

592
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:04,427
We didn't have motion controllers. We were building originally, although it ended up

593
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:05,008
shipping everywhere.

594
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:07,459
Building originally for a mobile device.

595
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,521
So we had like a trackpad and a click.

596
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:11,422
We didn't really have very high fidelity input.

597
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:13,063
So we went the other direction.

598
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:15,725
We actually kept the interaction super duper simple

599
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:19,688
because I didn't want the rules or the believability of

600
00:37:19,908 --> 00:37:22,851
the world to be broken by sort of an inconsistent rule set.

601
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,533
If I say, well, you can pick up that object, but you can't

602
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:27,194
pick up that object.

603
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:29,716
Or you can throw that one, but not that one because we

604
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:31,477
couldn't figure out how you should throw that one.

605
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,679
Then it will feel like a system again.

606
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:34,980
I don't want to feel like a system.

607
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,460
I want to feel like a.

608
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,921
Scary house where somebody got killed.

609
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:44,084
So when you talked about, earlier you talked about the symbol on the wall, right?

610
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:53,548
When you first go into that house, it's so well put together in terms of that, like, it feels like a character.

611
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:55,649
The place felt like...

612
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:03,475
A character so what were like the like point out just a couple things for those who've played Dead Secret

613
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:06,438
That were really key into

614
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:11,982
Making that magic there the care. Yeah the house. I mean is the character and very specifically

615
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:15,485
It's the character of the guy who's died so the the setup is that you know you're

616
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:20,414
Investigating this murder that's occurred and nobody believes it's murder except for

617
00:38:20,454 --> 00:38:24,159
you and you break in there and find the evidence and blow it wide open.

618
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:27,804
You kind of get into the house and figure out that it's significantly more complicated

619
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:28,565
than you might have imagined.

620
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:30,828
The very first scene...

621
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:36,288
is that you step into the sort of foyer, and there's a mirror, and you can see yourself

622
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:36,728
in the mirror.

623
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:41,673
And this was like a pain in the ass, engineering-wise, to do properly, because it's hard to render

624
00:38:41,713 --> 00:38:41,953
mirrors.

625
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:44,775
You end up rendering the scene four times, right?

626
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,437
Once for each eye, and then once for each reflection.

627
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:52,001
And I'm running this on a mobile device in 2015, so I worked a ton to make that freaking

628
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:53,482
mirror work, but it was important because...

629
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:56,185
I think everyone should give Chris a round of applause for that, because that's really

630
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:56,665
hard to do.

631
00:38:56,685 --> 00:38:57,666
Yeah.

632
00:38:57,686 --> 00:38:57,846
Just...

633
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:01,938
I spent an inordinate amount of engineering time on that stupid mirror.

634
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:05,159
But the reason was you had to be able to see who your character was.

635
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:11,722
And once you step into this space, you're going to be immersed in this other dude's life.

636
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,203
That's what his house is. It's a record of his life.

637
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:15,744
And he had a weirdo, messed up life.

638
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:19,005
And I have very, very few opportunities to tell you about your character.

639
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:21,026
And your character in my game is not...

640
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:26,951
You can see that it's not an everyman, it's a very specific person, and she has very specific traits.

641
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:30,614
And some of them I'm never going to tell you about, like she's got a broken arm and I'm not going to tell you why.

642
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:35,237
But you need to see that she has a broken arm so you know something about her.

643
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:40,721
And so it was really important for me to design the house such that I could do that very early on.

644
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:46,786
Once you get past that foyer point, you are into sort of the house itself.

645
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:49,528
And what we did was we went for a small...

646
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:54,506
A physically small space, I mean the whole game takes place in one house, that is high

647
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,747
density in terms of detail.

648
00:39:56,587 --> 00:40:01,469
So there's a zillion documents to read, you can look under the covers, or you can pull

649
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:08,913
up the futon or the couch pillows and look underneath them.

650
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:13,115
We tried to make sure that there was a reason to investigate every little area.

651
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:14,576
Because

652
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,543
If you do that, again, I think you're going to be thinking in context rather than thinking

653
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:21,023
about a system.

654
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:25,026
But also, you're going to be focused, and you're going to be a really close reader.

655
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:30,470
And if my goal is to scare you, then once you're focused, I have a lot of opportunities

656
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:30,790
to do that.

657
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:37,215
So, Dirk, one of the things I love about Space Pirate Trainer is the first time I played

658
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:39,096
it, I grew up in the 80s.

659
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:42,946
You know, arcade games and all that.

660
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:47,630
And it really felt like a natural evolution to that.

661
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:53,535
And I just remember, like, feeling like it was a real place.

662
00:40:53,835 --> 00:40:57,298
Like, not just, like, an arcade experience.

663
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:04,344
Like, looking out in the vistas and, like, the Blade Runner-esque kind of ads and stuff up top.

664
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:07,927
Like, how did you decide to go to that place?

665
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:08,888
Because I think that...

666
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:14,855
For me that that sells the virtual environment and it makes Space Pirate

667
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:19,601
Trainer better and more unique than everyone else who copied it.

668
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:26,462
That's actually the look we were going for because I just remembered when I was first

669
00:41:26,502 --> 00:41:31,246
playing VR games, I just remembered the times when I was at an arcade and playing those

670
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:34,188
games and I just wanted to have that same kind of feeling.

671
00:41:34,209 --> 00:41:38,732
I think the coloring in the Space Pirate Trainer, like the broken red and stuff, it's one of

672
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:41,094
the reasons why it feels a bit 80-ish.

673
00:41:41,895 --> 00:41:46,799
The first time I actually imported the whole model of the building into Space Pirate Trainer.

674
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:53,643
We thought it looked great on my computer and in the level designer, but when we saw it in real life in VR,

675
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:58,065
we actually noticed that there's a lack of detail.

676
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:04,527
Like sometimes if you create something for the first time in VR, you look at things in a different way.

677
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,388
For example, the ground floor under you.

678
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:10,712
It could look nice in your level editor, but you're so close to the ground that it needs

679
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:11,552
extra detail.

680
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:17,117
So we spend most of the time detailing everything that's very close to you.

681
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:21,480
So the first thing people do when they're in VR and they're holding an object, like

682
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,924
for example in Space Pirate Trainwreck Gun, they actually look at it very closely.

683
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:32,589
So we spent a lot of time just modeling the gun because it just gives you a seal of quality

684
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:36,112
if something in your hand that you're looking up close is high quality.

685
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:42,978
So the closer things get to your face, the more time you should spend on making something

686
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:44,980
that's high fidelity in terms of quality.

687
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,042
Same with, for example, the floor.

688
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:49,524
Make sure there's a detailed texturing and stuff in there.

689
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:53,688
It's just tiny details that make it feel more realistic.

690
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:58,212
I don't know how many of you guys have played Lone Echo, for example.

691
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:01,234
It's very AAA.

692
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:07,079
It's probably one of, next to Adam's one and Robo Recall, it's one of the big AAA titles.

693
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,864
And you can see, if you just take a look at the way they did the locomotion, the hands...

694
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:18,785
Like it actually grabs around stuff and the detail they put into the hands, it just gives you an immersion immediately.

695
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:27,707
I think having stuff with high quality very close to you and stuff with less quality a bit further away, it just makes the whole experience better.

696
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:37,329
You just have to, the first, the most things you do in VR just needs, like, it just needs, the first time you put an environment in VR, you always feel it needs more detail in my opinion.

697
00:43:39,342 --> 00:43:46,927
And of course, Will, with the Foo Show, like, he's got the best of all worlds, no pun intended,

698
00:43:46,987 --> 00:43:53,332
because he gets to go into all these other worlds and have an experience in them that

699
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:54,953
they weren't created for.

700
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:56,694
Can I ask you a question about that, actually?

701
00:43:56,794 --> 00:43:56,934
Yeah.

702
00:43:56,954 --> 00:43:58,015
I had a question.

703
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:02,879
So, I really liked going to the Firewatch Tower and playing with it, and I think that

704
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:13,367
The setup was that you're talking to the developers of the game and they're talking about how they modeled the assets and you're looking at them, but also kind of turned the world into a set, right?

705
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:23,755
How did you feel about that? Because once you can pick the things up and they have, you know, oh look it has no back or it has no weight, you know, there's no attempt to make it realistic, you're just showing the asset.

706
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:27,138
We're showing props, we're showing what it's like to go on Warner's backlot, basically, yeah.

707
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:29,840
How does that... was that intentional? How do you feel about that?

708
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:36,107
I'd like to say it was intentional, but really we recorded that episode, I think, on March 3rd.

709
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:43,515
And we released it, let's see, it came out on the Vive on launch day and it came out on Oculus the Friday after launch.

710
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:47,980
So, that was maybe three weeks of development, basically, from the time we recorded.

711
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:51,483
We recorded it as a test to see if we could do the recordings.

712
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:56,388
And then we shared it around to some friends, I sent it to some folks all over, and people

713
00:44:56,408 --> 00:44:58,950
looked at it and were like, you should release this, this is really good.

714
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:03,194
And we're like, well, it's like 10 days until the headsets are out.

715
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:03,714
I don't know if we can...

716
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,135
And they're like, no, you should really release it.

717
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:10,317
We hunkered down and a lot of the decisions we made in that were not intentional.

718
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:15,759
So things like, we knew that we wanted everybody to be able to look at the same object at the same time

719
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:18,680
without having to huddle around each other because then we knew it would feel cramped.

720
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,081
So we let them spawn clones.

721
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:24,802
But if we let them spawn clones, then conceivably somebody could just make a million clones

722
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:28,823
of the same object and fill the tower with garbage and chunk their performance and make

723
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:30,123
them feel nauseous.

724
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:35,024
So most of our decisions at that point were around making it a pleasant experience for

725
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:40,406
the viewer and letting you access the things that maybe you couldn't reach if you were

726
00:45:40,426 --> 00:45:43,986
on an Oculus with a gamepad at the time and didn't have room scale.

727
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:48,629
So we had like a force pull thing where you could grab stuff from across the room, which

728
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,630
worked surprisingly well.

729
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,291
Our teleport system was very rudimentary.

730
00:45:51,912 --> 00:45:52,892
All of that stuff was rough.

731
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:57,676
But the benefit we had was that we drafted on something that a really talented team of

732
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:00,057
like eight people had spent two and a half years making.

733
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:05,521
It turns out that bringing assets from other engines into Unity is a little more challenging

734
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:06,682
than we initially anticipated.

735
00:46:06,702 --> 00:46:07,623
But yeah.

736
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,809
The other benefit that we've had is we can go places that don't exist in the real world.

737
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:14,291
This is one of the important things.

738
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,252
If you're going to...

739
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:16,551
I

740
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:18,972
talked to a biochemist who makes nanomachines out of DNA.

741
00:46:41,745 --> 00:46:46,068
And we literally start out in his lab, which he's recreated for reasons I'm not going to

742
00:46:46,088 --> 00:46:48,409
get into here because he's awesome and a little bit crazy.

743
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:51,391
And then we do a powers of 10 thing.

744
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:56,033
We go inside the equipment in the lab and then we go into a microscopic scale world.

745
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:59,495
And then eventually we end up, when we finish the episode, standing between the lipid layers

746
00:46:59,935 --> 00:47:00,936
of an E. coli cell.

747
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:03,317
And that's a thing you can't do in the real world.

748
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:05,457
Like, you just, you can't see it.

749
00:47:05,497 --> 00:47:06,378
We can see the constructs.

750
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:09,799
We can see the way that he builds the nanomachines with these phage viruses.

751
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,560
And you can handle the phages and you can see how the stuff chunks together.

752
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,661
And that's something you can't do in any other medium that I'm aware of,

753
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:17,902
which is what we're trying to do.

754
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:19,502
So that's coming out soon.

755
00:47:19,823 --> 00:47:21,883
So do you guys agree?

756
00:47:21,903 --> 00:47:23,864
I want you to agree.

757
00:47:25,983 --> 00:47:41,142
Because it's something, like I said, I've been having issues with it, like, like, when you make a place in VR, like, it can't just be a normal place, it has to have these some kind of magical quality in it.

758
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:46,107
I mean it could be a place that doesn't, it could be a place that's inaccessible.

759
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:49,970
Like I would love to spend some time in the Oval Office and kind of like walk around and

760
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:56,075
see what it's like or in a missile silo or places that aren't, places that are, you know,

761
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:57,257
International Space Station.

762
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:58,558
That Oculus thing was amazing.

763
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:02,040
But the Oval Office is kind of like space, though.

764
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:04,522
It's not some place you can normally go.

765
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:04,962
Right.

766
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:05,482
Right?

767
00:48:05,623 --> 00:48:07,464
So that's magical in that sense, I guess.

768
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:07,764
Right.

769
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:08,424
Right.

770
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,946
Because I made a gas station and it was really terrible.

771
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:12,907
It was like...

772
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:13,788
Do you get to...

773
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:19,132
Do the kids that are going off to Chris' house roll up in an RV and they're like,

774
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:19,932
Hey guys!

775
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:22,514
And you're the grumpy old man that has to send them on their way to their doom?

776
00:48:22,534 --> 00:48:23,214
Yeah, I mean like...

777
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:29,303
Well, I just wanted to feel what it would be like to go to some place in VR that I could

778
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:30,865
just walk down the street and go to.

779
00:48:30,885 --> 00:48:32,748
I can see how that wouldn't work out.

780
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:33,629
Yeah, it just didn't work.

781
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:34,611
But I had to do it.

782
00:48:35,192 --> 00:48:36,434
And you know, now I know.

783
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:38,136
Now everyone knows.

784
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:43,139
If you create stuff that people already know, you see a lot more detail, because you know

785
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:45,080
how it should look and how it should feel.

786
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:50,523
It's the same thing if you're visiting stuff like a certain church in photogrammetry, for

787
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:50,964
example.

788
00:48:51,324 --> 00:48:55,106
It's great, because if you've never been there, you can actually see it, and maybe you can

789
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:57,187
go to places that aren't available for the public.

790
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:02,029
But if you've actually been there, and you remember the smell and the sound of it, it's

791
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:02,310
great.

792
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,912
There's just something different that you feel like you're losing something.

793
00:49:04,932 --> 00:49:05,652
It's like a shadow.

794
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:10,997
That's why you have to show stuff that you haven't experienced yet in our environment.

795
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:12,218
I mean, the same thing applies...

796
00:49:12,478 --> 00:49:14,279
Like, we realized that early on with the avatars, too.

797
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:14,960
If you try to make...

798
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,502
Like, our avatars, the animation's pretty janky.

799
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:21,545
But if you put it in a cel-shaded context, you put it in a low-poly context,

800
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:28,211
the people's brains forgive a lot of the errors that come with doing procedural animation live.

801
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:31,153
It turns out there's a fair number, and it's a challenging thing.

802
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:34,729
We had the same thing with, for example, the Space Pirate Trainer guns.

803
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:35,549
They don't have hands.

804
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:36,950
I had a lot of comments about that.

805
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,831
And the reason why I didn't put hands in it is because it's very hard to know.

806
00:49:41,731 --> 00:49:44,931
Next to the arm thing, it's very hard to know where the fingers are.

807
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:48,472
And it just breaks the illusion if it's not correct.

808
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,973
There are ways to handle this with the new controllers, because you're actually checking

809
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:54,654
what you're holding.

810
00:49:54,674 --> 00:49:56,834
But stuff like that breaks the illusion.

811
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:58,595
It's still just inferred from other data.

812
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,455
It's not measuring one-to-one, which is kind of what you want for that.

813
00:50:02,656 --> 00:50:07,359
All right, this is a good time for us to open up for Q&A.

814
00:50:09,181 --> 00:50:15,945
So we're talking about all the visual stuff now, about environment, but I believe there's a lot more.

815
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:20,789
For example, don't underestimate stuff like first feedback.

816
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,631
Audio is super important.

817
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:28,654
Those two things actually spend a lot of time on all the first feedback in Space Pirate Train.

818
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:30,736
It's one of the reasons why it feels good.

819
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:36,719
Because every type of gun has its own kind of force feedback curve.

820
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,442
And so people actually feel which gun they're shooting, even if they're shooting blindly without sound.

821
00:50:42,063 --> 00:50:48,207
Same thing with audio. Even if there's no music at all, there's still this environmental sound.

822
00:50:48,267 --> 00:50:55,291
It just dips you in the whole environment. It's super important that the thing combined makes the whole experience.

823
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:59,714
And it makes the whole environment look so much better just because of those extra impulses.

824
00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:05,098
I'm going to go on record and say I think for a believable environment, audio is more important

825
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:05,659
than your visuals.

826
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,003
Properly done audio with spatialization and in a good, you know, with the user having

827
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:17,128
headphones, you know, with no friction there, you can sell an environment with a black screen.

828
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,290
Yeah, no argument there for sure.

829
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:24,514
If you close your eyes and just have some audio of a forest, you actually are there

830
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:26,176
already and then the visuals come next.

831
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:28,558
We totally showed that on the Firewatch episode.

832
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:31,928
All right, anyone have any questions?

833
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,815
There's a, I guess there's a mic there,

834
00:51:36,355 --> 00:51:37,097
other people can hear.

835
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:41,885
Would you like to, there's a microphone?

836
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:43,387
Yeah, there's a microphone.

837
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,501
I have a question for Will Smith.

838
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,162
This maintains a particular interest of mine.

839
00:51:50,182 --> 00:51:53,384
I'm wondering if you're working with or thought of working with embryologists

840
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:58,448
so that we could relive our journey from conception to birth inside the womb.

841
00:51:58,928 --> 00:52:00,629
Have that be very, very real for us.

842
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:04,271
I haven't, but if you know anybody who has 3D assets that they've built,

843
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:07,333
then connect me and I'll talk to them because it sounds like that would be fun.

844
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:13,119
Hey, this question's for Chris.

845
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,040
We heard from the others about their thoughts on

846
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,241
representations of the mundane world.

847
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:26,842
And with all your ideas about language and the language of

848
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:31,863
VR and stuff like that, I was wondering, you were the only

849
00:52:31,903 --> 00:52:33,063
one that didn't answer that.

850
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,464
And I was wondering what your take on the role of the

851
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:38,284
representations of the mundane would be.

852
00:52:38,304 --> 00:52:40,165
I think that

853
00:52:41,231 --> 00:52:45,798
Adams' assessment is correct, which is that there needs to be a reason for the environment

854
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:46,980
to be interesting.

855
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:53,552
I mean, we could, it's true if we write a book, if I write like a very, you know, well

856
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:59,897
Well, if I was to write something that's a great description of a gas station, you may still not want to read it.

857
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,918
It has to have something. There has to be a reason for it to exist.

858
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:09,561
My game is probably, in terms of locale, the most mundane of the folks we have up here.

859
00:53:09,601 --> 00:53:11,642
It's just a farmhouse in Kansas.

860
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:15,423
But I try to make it interesting by having things that happened in it,

861
00:53:15,463 --> 00:53:17,304
or the objects in it be out of place,

862
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:22,626
or have objects or things about it that the viewer can't immediately understand,

863
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:23,527
so that there's a...

864
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,655
There's a story that's waiting there.

865
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:28,518
It's like a thread that they're going to have to pull out.

866
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:32,382
And it's actually OK that the environment itself is sort of

867
00:53:32,422 --> 00:53:33,924
a relatable place.

868
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:35,206
In fact, it's important to me to

869
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:39,312
for that particular game, for you to be able to believe that this could happen to you.

870
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,613
We chose a non-realistic art style.

871
00:53:41,753 --> 00:53:46,036
It's not super cartoony, but realism wasn't something we corrected for.

872
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:53,479
Because I actually think if the sound is right and if the world is consistent, even if the

873
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,141
location is sort of generally mundane, if there's something there, I think that's what

874
00:53:57,161 --> 00:53:58,161
Adam's talking about when he says magic.

875
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:02,184
If there's something there, a reason for you to be there, a reason for you to explore that

876
00:54:02,224 --> 00:54:05,025
world, then that is why you're there.

877
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:07,346
And all the world really has to do is reinforce that and be consistent.

878
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:25,750
About 30 years ago, Gerard Lanier used to hold fantastic VR classes at the universities

879
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,350
around town.

880
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,111
And the technology was very modest.

881
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:35,593
It was low-end Macs usually, Mac classics, running simple, you know, 3D packages.

882
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,053
But they were VR classes.

883
00:54:37,714 --> 00:54:43,135
And a lot of the point he was raising in his lectures and workshops had to do with a kind

884
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:45,116
of attempt to identify...

885
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:52,358
You know, what he was looking for was a kind of universal language of communication within

886
00:54:52,398 --> 00:55:00,961
VR, akin to, he called it body music, a kind of, you know, body language communicated through

887
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:02,942
simple gestures over a distance.

888
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:09,805
You know, a little bit like HTML and the web were an attempt to universalize text over

889
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:10,665
a distance, right?

890
00:55:12,706 --> 00:55:15,827
And, you know, because universal ways of communication were the...

891
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:18,485
common thread in the early 90s.

892
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:26,371
And VR looked to be, at that time, another branch of that attempt to universalize communication

893
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:32,736
at a distance, except the ontology was one of continuous movement.

894
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:39,822
So with VR, you have the 360 experience, but also the gestures of the person.

895
00:55:41,825 --> 00:55:46,166
There seems to be a tension now between an attempt to standardize this stuff because

896
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:52,927
the technology is standardized and the delivery mechanisms are increasingly commercialized

897
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:53,708
and standardized.

898
00:55:54,228 --> 00:56:00,629
What are your views on that kind of legacy of the language of VR as a 30, 40, 50 year

899
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:07,491
set of research inquiries in relation to now?

900
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:13,077
Well, I'll just say one quick thing about that is we shouldn't be standardizing anything right now.

901
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:15,060
It's too early.

902
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:20,028
I mean, we're essentially in like 1905 with film right now.

903
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,231
I agree.

904
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:23,073
I don't think...

905
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:29,672
I think that the pace at which the technology related to VR is going to continue to dramatically

906
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:31,093
change is pretty fast.

907
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,796
We are a year and a half out from the very first commercial headsets.

908
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:39,138
The Oculus's touch controller shipped less than a year ago.

909
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:45,282
There's a lot of obvious technology that doesn't exist at a commercialized level today.

910
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,271
We should track your face. What if we knew your expressions?

911
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:50,831
What if we knew where your shoulders were doing?

912
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:53,352
What if we know where you're looking in the headset?

913
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:57,333
Yeah, I mean like, I feel like there are a number of sort of,

914
00:56:57,353 --> 00:57:01,614
I won't call them low-hanging fruit, but clearly achievable in the next couple of years

915
00:57:01,674 --> 00:57:04,175
sort of technologies that could...

916
00:57:05,382 --> 00:57:09,746
Significantly change the way that we express ourselves in a virtual space and the fidelity

917
00:57:09,766 --> 00:57:10,427
of those expressions.

918
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:16,832
So I think that probably the things that we see today are only very vague footsteps in

919
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,153
the direction towards what you're talking about.

920
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:23,578
The thing I'd say is that the standard is going to be what you can do with your human

921
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:28,983
body, not what Facebook says we can do or what Valve says we can do or whatever.

922
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,543
I agree.

923
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:33,981
Hi.

924
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,726
There's a few virtual worlds popping up

925
00:57:36,766 --> 00:57:38,669
that are based on user-generated content.

926
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:40,191
And I was wondering what mistakes

927
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:41,534
you think a user might make when they're

928
00:57:41,554 --> 00:57:43,076
building an environment, and what tools

929
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:46,181
you think users need to make virtual environments that

930
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:46,762
don't suck.

931
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:52,269
I mean, they'll make the same mistakes we made, right?

932
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:55,970
You just try stuff and you put your friends in it and they tell you that this makes them

933
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:00,752
feel bad or they like this and you just keep iterating until you find something that works.

934
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:03,774
I mean, maybe these guys have smarter answers.

935
00:58:03,954 --> 00:58:07,495
Well, no, I mean, I think you're, I mean, the tricky thing about comfort is that

936
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:13,341
We can meet a certain level of comfort for a large percentage of people just by having good hardware.

937
00:58:13,762 --> 00:58:14,843
We have a lot of good hardware now.

938
00:58:15,223 --> 00:58:18,547
But that's actually not enough to make all experiences comfortable.

939
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:21,671
In fact, there's a huge swath of experiences, like Half-Life, for example,

940
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:23,453
that even on good hardware is going to make everybody sick.

941
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:33,667
So, what you don't see in the final product is that all the things that, you know, we tried in the production and it made people sick, we cut.

942
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:34,928
Because we don't want to make people sick.

943
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:43,135
So, there are, and there's just like super fascinating differences between the way that people feel discomfort.

944
00:58:43,235 --> 00:58:48,759
I had a person tell me in early development of Dead Secret that they were uncomfortable because I placed them too close to a wall.

945
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,903
And they felt that they were, you know, their shoulders should be touching the wall but they couldn't feel it and that made them feel bad.

946
00:58:53,223 --> 00:58:53,683
Yeah, I mean...

947
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:59,546
I think that users who are building this stuff for the first time

948
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:02,168
will just go through that same learning curve

949
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:06,910
and you'll have a lot of content that you cannot guarantee is comfortable

950
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,231
and the folks who are consuming that have to be sort of okay with that.

951
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:11,272
If you're not susceptible to motion sickness,

952
00:59:11,312 --> 00:59:13,574
it's really good to have somebody on your team like Dirk, who is.

953
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:20,647
Yeah, I mean, I think Will was on point by saying you can make all the mistakes.

954
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:25,430
We built and deleted Adrift three times before we finished it.

955
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:29,873
It just, it didn't work because it was new.

956
00:59:31,474 --> 00:59:37,058
It's amazing to have all the tools and it's amazing that people are out there making VR,

957
00:59:37,098 --> 00:59:39,099
but you're just going to have to...

958
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:46,803
So that's how you find the good stuff, peering around in the dark and then accidentally figuring

959
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:47,343
something out.

960
00:59:47,743 --> 00:59:48,964
And that's what's awesome about VR.

961
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:56,567
With user generated content, you're limiting, you're actually, probably the most common

962
00:59:56,667 --> 00:59:58,868
use is just creating levels and stuff.

963
00:59:59,328 --> 01:00:05,391
But most of the interactivity or the core thing is already programmed.

964
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:07,012
So I think...

965
01:00:07,732 --> 01:00:12,356
Even for believing in a realistic world, it's all about these small interactive things and

966
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:13,777
the way you push a button and stuff.

967
01:00:14,117 --> 01:00:16,458
So that's already done by the developer.

968
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,060
So we already made those mistakes.

969
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,742
If you're creating user-generated content, you're just going to create some mistakes

970
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:26,886
concerning environments, but not the interaction design, because that's what's already done

971
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:27,606
by the developer.

972
01:00:27,626 --> 01:00:33,110
So I think it's just part of the mistakes that the developer made.

973
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,312
We got time for one final question.

974
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:36,132
Thank you.

975
01:00:36,252 --> 01:00:36,452
Thank you.

976
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:36,713
Thank you.

977
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:36,993
Thank you.

978
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:40,390
Hello. This question aroused when Quark Cannon was speaking.

979
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:46,173
But anyone can answer it. You were talking about how you have to change the view of action

980
01:00:46,273 --> 01:00:49,734
and going on in front of you and behind you. When is it appropriate or what type of games

981
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:54,136
would it be appropriate to have action going on behind you? I guess is my question.

982
01:00:54,576 --> 01:00:58,162
It depends on how overwhelming something is.

983
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:03,710
If you put someone in a game and they use a lot of audio cues, for example,

984
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,736
where the user should look at, then you can try to implement some 360.

985
01:01:09,978 --> 01:01:12,221
So, you don't know where people will be looking at.

986
01:01:12,281 --> 01:01:16,204
So even when I put people into Space Park Trainer, they can't find the menu because

987
01:01:16,224 --> 01:01:17,285
sometimes it's behind them.

988
01:01:17,946 --> 01:01:21,269
So you have to direct the user where they're looking at.

989
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:25,453
And if you're creating a... you could do 360 experiences, of course, but you have to...

990
01:01:26,504 --> 01:01:28,944
show the user where to look at.

991
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:33,106
And we do it, for example, when we're opening up the angle

992
01:01:33,446 --> 01:01:36,106
for enemies, for example, like at first they just come

993
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,267
in the 60 degrees of field angle,

994
01:01:38,347 --> 01:01:40,368
but they open up throughout the wave,

995
01:01:40,388 --> 01:01:41,888
so they get further and further away.

996
01:01:42,228 --> 01:01:44,889
And so one of the problems were if you weren't using audio

997
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:47,270
and it wasn't loud enough, you actually weren't looking

998
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,650
at where the droid was shooting from.

999
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,691
And so we implemented a system that was flashing

1000
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:54,052
the right side of your HMD, so you had glow.

1001
01:01:55,452 --> 01:01:59,695
And then we actually felt like, oh, there's something happening in that part, and you look around.

1002
01:01:59,775 --> 01:02:07,318
So these are all cues that can be helpful for creating experiences that are more like a 360 and not 180.

1003
01:02:07,919 --> 01:02:10,880
So it's about audio-visual cues most of the time.

1004
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:18,581
All right. I want to thank everyone for coming. I want to thank Dirk and Will and Chris for agreeing to do this with me.

1005
01:02:19,082 --> 01:02:19,603
Thank you very much.

1006
01:02:19,623 --> 01:02:20,203
Thanks guys.

1007
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:26,452
And thank you for coming. Don't forget to fill out your evaluations and have fun in VR.

1008
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:27,313
Enjoy VRDC.
