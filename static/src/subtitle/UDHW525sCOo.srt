00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:06,139
My name's Jamie Windsor.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,042
I'm a team builder, a designer, an engineer,

3
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:14,144
and I'm also a founder of a company called One More Game,

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,045
along with a really good friend of mine, Patrick Wyatt.

5
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,908
One More Game is an independent Seattle-based studio.

6
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:23,789
We're currently self-funded.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,292
We started this about in early February.

8
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:31,994
So we haven't been at it very long.

9
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,695
But Pat and I have been making games.

10
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:37,426
on and off together for about a decade now.

11
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:41,710
And although we haven't made an announcement, we have a

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,690
website that's public.

13
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,132
You can check that out.

14
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,433
But we've been pretty quiet so far.

15
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:52,118
But why I'm here today is to present a framework or a tool

16
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:56,081
or a process that's the center of our incremental and

17
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,562
iterative development process.

18
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,064
I didn't always develop this way.

19
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,306
I thought I did, by the way.

20
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:03,387
But.

21
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:09,670
it turns out that I wasn't being as iterative as I thought I was.

22
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:16,635
So let me give you some background about a problem I had, which led me to the solution

23
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:18,097
that I'm going to be sharing with you today.

24
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:25,040
So I worked on a game for about two years that we pushed into early access.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,521
It was called Moonrise.

26
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:34,725
It was a mobile game, but also on PC, Mac OS, and it was one of the first experiences

27
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:41,688
that I had where I could play a game at work, get on a bus, play it on the bus, get home,

28
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:46,211
play it at home, do the same thing the next day on the way to work and then play it at

29
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:46,471
work.

30
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:47,892
I love this game.

31
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:50,728
We worked on it, like I said, for about two years,

32
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:53,990
and at its core, I knew it was something that was really fun.

33
00:01:55,051 --> 00:02:00,815
But, obviously, we had to make some changes

34
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:04,498
because it wasn't landing the way that we thought it would land with our players.

35
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,860
This was after about two years of development.

36
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,243
So we continued to work on the next big release.

37
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,805
We prioritized a bunch of features.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,225
And as we would develop them and release them, we started to realize we were prioritizing things the wrong way.

39
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:25,010
Or the players that we had, they weren't really accepting the things that we were developing.

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,114
We were building something off of a design doc or something that we thought we needed to build,

41
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:34,539
but as we released them, they were just not landing with people the way that we thought they would.

42
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,443
Eventually, we had to cancel the project to work on something else that we had in the pipe.

43
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,971
But that experience really stuck with me.

44
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,552
How did we get there?

45
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,433
We were building something that I personally loved,

46
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,793
and I was sure people were really gonna enjoy,

47
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:50,614
and my coworkers felt that way as well.

48
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,014
And this was a team that,

49
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,715
I never worked with anyone better than this before.

50
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:59,457
It was only after the project shuttered

51
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,577
that we started to talk about what went wrong.

52
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:05,097
We started having conversations about it pretty much daily.

53
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:08,619
And we all wanted to figure out at the root of the problem

54
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:10,720
so that we didn't repeat that again.

55
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,422
So I know this is a red flag today

56
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:16,763
to wait that long to start talking about where something

57
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:17,163
went wrong.

58
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:19,364
I mean, I knew it back then.

59
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,946
I just kind of was in my formative years of my career.

60
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:27,248
And I instead opted to listen to the people around me

61
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,228
that were more experienced.

62
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:31,625
And when we got together in groups

63
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:34,246
and we started talking together about the problems,

64
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:38,886
we started realizing that people had different ideas of what

65
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:39,427
we were building.

66
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,227
On the surface, they all understood

67
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:44,327
we were building this mobile creature battler.

68
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:46,768
But then you start to get into more details.

69
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:48,608
And like, for instance, I might think

70
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,688
this is a competitive game.

71
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,189
And then some other players might think,

72
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,889
developers may think this was more of a story-based game

73
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:56,170
or was more of a casual game.

74
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:59,902
And then you start thinking, well, our audience seems to be everyone.

75
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:05,905
So, let me digress for a quick second.

76
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:09,086
Who here has heard of the broken telephone game or played this when they were a kid?

77
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,068
Right, most of the audience.

78
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:16,089
So, for folks that don't know, the telephone game is

79
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,371
when someone starts a conversation and whispers it into another person's ear.

80
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,677
and that person says it to the next person,

81
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:22,717
and so on and so on.

82
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:24,678
And eventually you get to the last person,

83
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:26,899
and like this picture shows,

84
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,679
the first person said peas,

85
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,460
and the last person thought they said fleas.

86
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,621
Turns out this game isn't just

87
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,682
something we played in the schoolyard.

88
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,043
It's also an important learning experience

89
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,523
about how conversation works.

90
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:41,764
When you encode a message into someone else,

91
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:44,105
they decode it, send it to the next person,

92
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,185
and it's lossful,

93
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:48,766
like as if I saved an image many times over, right?

94
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,149
you end up with something like this.

95
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:52,869
This is Cake Rex.

96
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:55,430
If you guys have never seen this before,

97
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,170
I'm probably completely late to the party on this,

98
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,610
by the way.

99
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,911
But this is when somebody calls a cake shop,

100
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,071
says what they want,

101
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,072
and then the person encodes it into a message,

102
00:05:07,092 --> 00:05:09,372
hands it off to the artist that's putting the cake together,

103
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:11,433
builds it, and then you end up with something like this.

104
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,533
Best wishes, Suzanne.

105
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:15,473
Underneath that, we will miss you.

106
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:18,754
Well, clearly they meant that, but not exactly like that.

107
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,835
Or this one, happy birthday, just happy birthday.

108
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,357
Right, it's a perfect explanation, right?

109
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,560
So if I have an idea in my head

110
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,900
and I describe it in writing,

111
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,482
when you read it, you might possibly imagine

112
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:36,882
something completely different.

113
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,304
But when I ask you, you'll say, oh no, I agree.

114
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:43,726
So for my team working on Moonrise,

115
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,147
we basically knew what we were building

116
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:47,148
because we were reading off of the same document.

117
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,976
I felt we had a good grasp of what we were building.

118
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:51,876
Everyone's the hero of their own story.

119
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,257
So of course, the game that I thought we were building

120
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:55,318
was the game that we were building.

121
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:58,158
And we were effective at building this thing.

122
00:05:58,398 --> 00:05:59,019
It's coming out.

123
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,860
So I didn't understand that there was a problem.

124
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,401
And it wasn't that someone was wrong.

125
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,001
It was that we weren't aligned.

126
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:09,242
And we thought we were.

127
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:10,622
That's the biggest problem.

128
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,383
This is because written instructions

129
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:16,644
can be surprisingly hard to internalize and execute upon.

130
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,001
Shared documents are not shared understanding.

131
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,902
They're simply a shared document that

132
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:24,302
everyone can read from.

133
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,445
If you read from that document, I could even ask

134
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:30,326
you, do you agree with me with what's written here?

135
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,367
And you may say, yes, we all agree.

136
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:36,557
However, if we get together and talk one-on-one or in a group,

137
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:40,820
if we use pictures, images, any visual representation where

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,623
we can move things along and we can start to map out

139
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,705
each other's ideas, we may realize we are on completely

140
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:48,426
different pages.

141
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:52,128
So if you look at this picture right here, you'll see a group

142
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,589
of people, oh, I'm glad we all agree.

143
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,311
They all agree that we're working on a shape.

144
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,253
But then when you draw it out, you realize, oh, I'm building

145
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,415
a square, you're building a circle, and you're building a

146
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:01,875
triangle.

147
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,401
getting together and talking about it

148
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,802
and visualizing those things

149
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:07,943
will actually get people on the same page.

150
00:07:08,563 --> 00:07:11,025
And you may feel like this was an exercise

151
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,406
that cost a lot of time and money

152
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,706
because meetings are expensive,

153
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,228
but in the end, it sucked that we weren't on the same page,

154
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,010
but it's better now that we are on the same page

155
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,531
and we are sure moving forward.

156
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:26,614
So from this experience working on Moonrise,

157
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,295
I realized that an all-encompassing dev bible

158
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:32,337
was basically an artifact of waterfall development.

159
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:35,893
We all said we were building in an Agile methodology,

160
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,414
but we were only doing it in name, pretty much.

161
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,597
Yeah, we took certain processes from the Agile manifesto

162
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:45,498
or from things that came after that,

163
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:48,500
but in the end, we were completely misaligned,

164
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,581
and we just weren't prioritizing the things

165
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,462
that we really needed to prioritize.

166
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,564
And the more we detailed in that document,

167
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,685
and the bigger the team that got,

168
00:07:58,446 --> 00:07:59,566
the bigger the team got,

169
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,728
the worse the problem would become.

170
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,779
So it's because of this that I like to think of design

171
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,401
documents instead like photographs or vacation photos.

172
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:13,903
Instead of writing an 80-page design doc, write something

173
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:18,265
that defines a story that you can then tell everyone else.

174
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:21,607
So if I show you this picture, you just see a

175
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:22,427
picture of two people.

176
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,428
You might recognize that I'm one of them, because I don't

177
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,189
have sleeves on, right?

178
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,710
And it's a lifestyle choice, OK?

179
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,584
So this is my girlfriend, Wonder, and I.

180
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:35,366
And we're at the top of a pretty big mountain in Washington.

181
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:36,127
I'm from Seattle.

182
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:37,868
I live there now.

183
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,392
And this was a day, a long day, after riding dirt bikes.

184
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,153
And she's never ridden dirt bikes for the first time.

185
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:48,596
And she agreed to do it, even though it's not her thing.

186
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,357
And the dirt bike was too big for her.

187
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,859
And I don't know how she was able to do it, falling off,

188
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,722
getting back on, going up trails that I thought were difficult.

189
00:08:57,762 --> 00:08:57,903
And

190
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,982
You know, as I look at this picture,

191
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:01,864
I can tell you this whole story.

192
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,766
I can tell you that earlier in the day,

193
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:06,850
my friend almost flipped a 4x4 in the parking lot

194
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,612
and then wasn't allowed to drive a motorcycle that day.

195
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:12,396
I can also tell you that my birthday almost got canceled

196
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:15,080
because we showed up and none of the motorcycles worked.

197
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,762
So we had to float a river that day, right?

198
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:21,288
Anyway, the point of this is to tell you that a picture exists

199
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:23,689
so that way you can remember the things that

200
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,429
happened around it.

201
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,009
And I think that's the way that your documents should work.

202
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,870
You shouldn't try to encode all of your intent, especially if

203
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,911
you're developing something that might come out in two to

204
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:33,491
four years.

205
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,871
What you really want to do is just have an open framework

206
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,532
with the ideals of what you're trying to accomplish that

207
00:09:40,832 --> 00:09:43,092
everyone can get around and talk about and have

208
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,253
conversations about so they remember why

209
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:45,853
they're building it.

210
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,196
You also want to design with now in mind.

211
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:56,897
So if we're not writing design documents, which exist out for four years or so,

212
00:09:57,758 --> 00:10:01,040
think about the first three months or the next three months, I should say.

213
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,142
Live now and not later.

214
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:08,605
The more you try to predict in the future, the more you're probably going to be wrong.

215
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,867
If you're trying to land a rocket on Mars,

216
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:16,090
there's a lot of conditions that need to happen before that lands.

217
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:19,472
And it's an extremely difficult task.

218
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:23,304
You don't need to be the most skilled developer or producer

219
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:26,847
or engineer or artist to be able to just predict

220
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,368
the next three months.

221
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:32,451
The longer you predict out, the more difficult it becomes.

222
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,453
So I like to use something called the now and later model.

223
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:39,556
What I like to do is think of the world as it exists today.

224
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:41,638
And who are the people in that world,

225
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:43,039
and what are their problems?

226
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,941
Ultimately, your job is

227
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,165
to change the world.

228
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,866
I even stutter as I say it, because it's

229
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,027
pretty lofty to think about.

230
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:53,147
We're game developers.

231
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,388
We make things that are fun.

232
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:55,409
We don't make toys.

233
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:56,189
We make games.

234
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,671
But still, the idea that you're changing

235
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,072
the world should sit in.

236
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:02,433
You are.

237
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,294
You make something for the people today with the problems

238
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:05,894
they have today.

239
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,856
You have ideas about how you can solve those problems.

240
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,698
You output a solution into a release.

241
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,819
And then you look at the outcome.

242
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:16,874
Did I deliver on the intent that I meant to do?

243
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:20,076
Did I make the player feel the way that I wanted them to feel?

244
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:23,198
Did I deliver the experience that I set out to change?

245
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,040
If you recall, I told you more about my experience

246
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,962
playing at work, getting on a bus, and getting to work.

247
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:31,423
That could be any game.

248
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,605
That, at the time, was a thing I had never touched before.

249
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,146
So it really imprinted on me.

250
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,347
And it was a thing I really wanted

251
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:39,388
to accomplish with this game.

252
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,445
If you go through this process, you might realize

253
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:45,086
that there's all kinds of products you could build,

254
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,908
all kinds of features you could build,

255
00:11:47,088 --> 00:11:49,529
all kinds of enhancements, and together as a group,

256
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,951
you'll end up ideating and figuring out what those are.

257
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:59,515
So starting from that point, I encode these ideas

258
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,217
into something called a product framing doc.

259
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:07,635
The product framing doc is existing to answer these five questions.

260
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:12,378
The why, which is the background required to explain the rationality initiative.

261
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:19,082
This might include market conditions, the competitive landscape, historical context.

262
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:24,285
The proposal, this thing frames the scope of the initiative

263
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:24,985
at a high level.

264
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:27,146
It's important that it's at a high level.

265
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,968
It provides enough detail though that it's

266
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:32,229
clear what the initiative seeks to achieve for the player.

267
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:36,400
And then players, these are the people you're building it for.

268
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,581
And I like to make sure that we have two sets of groups.

269
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:42,382
One is the beachhead, or the early adopters,

270
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:44,583
because they have different behaviors

271
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:47,284
than your later adopters or your normal players.

272
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:50,385
You may be going for the larger market,

273
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,306
but you need to pay attention to who's going

274
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:53,766
to play in the beginning first.

275
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:59,068
If you don't get early adoption, you don't get later adoption.

276
00:12:59,168 --> 00:12:59,568
Makes sense.

277
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,638
The next is outcomes.

278
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,239
Why are we doing this?

279
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,840
What is the point of putting any of this work in?

280
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:15,184
And the last is metrics, which is ways to prove that I

281
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,705
achieved the outcome that I meant to, and they must be

282
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:18,225
measurable.

283
00:13:19,105 --> 00:13:20,006
They can't be vague.

284
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,327
They have to be actual numbers that you might put up on a

285
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:25,288
dashboard somewhere, some way to communicate with everyone

286
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:27,849
else to say, hey, we actually accomplished what we set out

287
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:28,370
to accomplish.

288
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,087
You can do this any way you like, but I like to use

289
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:34,888
something called an opportunity canvas for this.

290
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,171
An opportunity canvas will act as a center point for all the

291
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:39,712
conversations that we're about to have.

292
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,873
In the technique that I'm going to show you later, I

293
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:45,596
bring an opportunity canvas to a user story mapping session.

294
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:50,079
It's how I align people around who we're building for and

295
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,281
what we're building, and also align people around what our

296
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,182
business's goals are.

297
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,019
This is an exercise that could be a talk all of its own,

298
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,780
but I'll talk really, really quickly about why I use it to

299
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,781
frame my conversations.

300
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:06,522
So I know this looks like a mess at first if you've never

301
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:10,063
seen it. The numbers represent the order in which you would

302
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:10,523
do things.

303
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,605
So you start in the center, and then you go to box two.

304
00:14:14,905 --> 00:14:17,166
Each one of those boxes, this is probably difficult to read,

305
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:17,486
by the way.

306
00:14:17,526 --> 00:14:20,307
You can get this off of Jeff Patton's website.

307
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:23,368
If you just search for Opportunity Canvas on Google,

308
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:23,868
it'll come up.

309
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,251
Don't do it right now, please.

310
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,437
So the important part of this is it looks like chaos,

311
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,959
because it's not for encoding, it's for decoding.

312
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,142
When you go through and read it later, you can read it

313
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:37,743
left to right.

314
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:41,026
And left represents the state of the world today, and right

315
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,609
represents the state of the world later, the now and

316
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,070
later model.

317
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,791
The top represents users, while the bottom represents

318
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,311
the business.

319
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:50,832
So in the upper left, I can talk about the state of the

320
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:53,613
world for our players, whereas in the bottom left, I can talk

321
00:14:53,653 --> 00:14:55,134
about the state of the world for our business.

322
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,075
Like I said, you don't need to use this exact thing.

323
00:14:59,156 --> 00:14:59,756
I recommend it.

324
00:15:00,256 --> 00:15:02,377
But the most important thing is, regardless of how you

325
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,578
come up with your product framing doc, that it's

326
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:05,838
flexible.

327
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,359
Requirements are a really hard word.

328
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:15,086
They're absolute and people will take them as a must-have.

329
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:18,809
And really what a requirement is, is just ideas that you

330
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:20,750
have about how to change the world.

331
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:24,314
Again, really lofty, but that's it.

332
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,498
We often built things in Moonrise because they were

333
00:15:29,538 --> 00:15:30,859
requirements set down to us.

334
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,181
And we would build them in the order that we were told to

335
00:15:33,221 --> 00:15:35,422
build them in, sometimes by our publisher or sometimes

336
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,423
because even experienced people.

337
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,286
I was experienced enough on my own to say, I need to build

338
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:44,248
this next, but did we really need to build chat right then?

339
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:45,068
I'm not sure.

340
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,492
So you have your product framing doc.

341
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,474
The next thing that you want to do is get together as a

342
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,215
group and tell a story to each other.

343
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,285
When you do this, you'll find out that, one, you're going to

344
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:01,626
get a bunch of buy-in from people.

345
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:02,926
Because they're going to interact.

346
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:03,847
They're going to collaborate.

347
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,788
Unlike this room right now, where I'm broadcasting to you,

348
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,869
if we sat down in a circle, we could share ideas.

349
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,590
And when you share ideas, you can get people really excited

350
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,471
about what you're building.

351
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,451
If we do x, we'll get x.

352
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,433
And you get a diverse group of people together.

353
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:21,714
You want that because you have blind spots.

354
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,655
So if I had a grand vision.

355
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,732
I'm going to be wrong simply because I'm only a 34-year-old

356
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:34,373
tall white male who played Quake back in the day and then

357
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,253
World of Warcraft.

358
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,614
I'm probably going to keep trying to build the same thing

359
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:40,735
unless I had people around me that could fill in those blind

360
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:41,075
spots.

361
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:46,796
So when you get together and tell a story, you also ensure

362
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:49,377
that people know that story and they can share it with

363
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,057
others on the team.

364
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:54,058
So this is the lead that I've buried.

365
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,872
You're here to hear about user story mapping, which

366
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,573
is how you tell that story.

367
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,637
This is a tool that I picked up from a guy named Adam

368
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:06,379
Jacob, who's the CTO of a company called Chef Software.

369
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,962
He's a great friend of mine and also a huge influence.

370
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:13,085
I took a break from games for a short period because I

371
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,107
wanted to know what went wrong on that

372
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:15,968
product that I built.

373
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,470
I didn't think I was going to get it at the

374
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,331
place that I was at.

375
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,272
So I left.

376
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:23,153
games for a short period of time, about three years,

377
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:24,513
to go work in enterprise software,

378
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:26,374
a startup that builds enterprise software,

379
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:28,534
so I could go sit in larger enterprises

380
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:32,375
to figure out how you solve problems for people that big.

381
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,396
From that, I met Jeff Patton, who wrote this book.

382
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:37,897
And this framework was given to me

383
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:43,739
as a way to align my team building a next generation

384
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:44,959
piece of software for that company.

385
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,211
It changed the way that I collaborated with the team,

386
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:50,692
and it changed the way that I thought about solving problems.

387
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:55,674
So I'm going to give you guys a mock version of this

388
00:17:55,714 --> 00:17:58,035
that you can bring home and try out with your teams.

389
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:02,197
It's an exercise that'll only take about an hour.

390
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:04,698
You'll only need a couple things.

391
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:07,239
So first is you need an idea for a product feature

392
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:07,779
or enhancement.

393
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,292
In this section, I'm gonna give you a fake one,

394
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:12,632
which is a morning routine.

395
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,833
You need a whiteboard, you need some markers

396
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:20,154
and sticky notes, a timer, and a group of engaged minds.

397
00:18:20,294 --> 00:18:23,775
People that have an open mind about trying new things out.

398
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,217
Don't bring this to somebody that's process-averse,

399
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:27,817
for example.

400
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:29,217
Not at first.

401
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:32,939
So we're gonna build a product frame,

402
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,261
sorry, we're gonna build a user story map

403
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:38,183
around the product frame of building a morning routine.

404
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:41,545
I choose this because it's something

405
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,686
everyone knows how to do,

406
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,707
and everyone kind of does it differently,

407
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,148
which helps illustrate a point.

408
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,032
So the first part is an initial brainstorm.

409
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:52,693
Grab everyone, put them in the room,

410
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:54,855
hand out sticky notes, hand out markers.

411
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:56,556
Ideally they're different colors,

412
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,237
so that way people know who wrote what.

413
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:04,078
ask your participants to write the activities that they have

414
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:07,240
from when they wake up all the way until they get to their desk

415
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,182
at work. Whatever detail they like, one activity per sticky

416
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:14,624
note and then set a timer for five minutes. When anyone's done

417
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:17,265
writing on all the sticky notes, they put the marker down and

418
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:23,488
they just hang out for a little bit. When the timer's up, ask

419
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:26,790
people to put down their markers if they haven't and then use a

420
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,871
system called Fistify.

421
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:35,158
A 5 is where you raise your hand and then together you reveal a 5, a 1, or any number

422
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:35,618
in between.

423
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,419
A 5 is I'm good.

424
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:38,999
A 1 means I need more time.

425
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,041
And then you kind of look at the room and gain a consensus.

426
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:43,541
Okay, we need some more time.

427
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:44,442
Set the timer again.

428
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:45,402
If not, everyone's a 5.

429
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:46,302
Keep going.

430
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:49,164
And do it as long as the group needs.

431
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:54,906
If there's one person that's holding a 1 and they keep doing it, just ask them, do we really

432
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:55,466
need more time?

433
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:57,972
and then keep on going if the answer's yes.

434
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:01,255
But we use this so that way one voice in the room

435
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:02,997
doesn't plow through everyone else.

436
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,818
Like if you do this with your CEO,

437
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,620
you might look at him and he's like, no, I'm good.

438
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,141
And then everyone's like, oh, we're good too.

439
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,062
So that's why we use this system.

440
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,007
All right, so once you have all the stickies written,

441
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,028
each represent an activity,

442
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,190
have one person go up to the board

443
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:22,353
and put each sticky note up in chronological order

444
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:23,734
in a horizontal line.

445
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:27,040
As they do it, have them read to the room

446
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,443
and tell the story about what their morning routine is.

447
00:20:32,104 --> 00:20:34,647
Have the second person go up, and again, chronologically.

448
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:36,268
And they put it in their order.

449
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,990
They don't have to do the same order

450
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,931
that the other person said.

451
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,815
And then below that, and then below that,

452
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:43,916
and then as soon as they're done,

453
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,777
you'll have something that looks like this.

454
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,320
I know this is extremely difficult to read,

455
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:50,562
so here's a zoomed-in version.

456
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,420
And all right, I think some people can probably read this one.

457
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,301
If not, the top line is one person.

458
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,181
They hit snooze like three times before they get up.

459
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:04,582
They take a shower, they brush their teeth,

460
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:06,302
they put on some deodorant.

461
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,463
The person below them probably represents someone

462
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,963
that has a family or they're married.

463
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,404
They wake up to feed a baby

464
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,184
and then they wake their husband up.

465
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:16,585
And the person below that is someone

466
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,585
that's probably more concerned about their health.

467
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,165
They're cooking breakfast, they're going to the gym.

468
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:24,187
And this is a zoomed in next chronological order

469
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:29,890
where the person on top just kind of goes to the bus.

470
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,912
This is clearly a bachelor, that's my routine probably.

471
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:37,355
The person below them is taking a little bit more time

472
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:40,897
and then below that they're working more on the gym.

473
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:42,477
And this is the end.

474
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:45,778
The point of this was there's a beginning, a middle,

475
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:46,979
and an end of every story.

476
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,820
And you want to make sure that that's

477
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,121
representative from each one of the people writing

478
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:51,741
sticky notes.

479
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:54,743
So there's going to be shared tasks between them,

480
00:21:55,463 --> 00:21:56,484
between the three authors.

481
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:58,505
And they're also going to be wildly different potentially,

482
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:02,486
but reasonable morning routines.

483
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:05,888
The next step is as a moderator.

484
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,030
It's your job to facilitate formation of something

485
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,290
called the backbone of the story.

486
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:15,353
And the backbone is just umbrellas of like tasks

487
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:19,114
or things that could be reasoned about being of the same shape.

488
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:24,617
In a real user story map, this would be like,

489
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:27,878
I log into a web page or something like that, right?

490
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:29,899
And then we would maybe say all of log in.

491
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
and that represents a bone.

492
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:37,964
Here, I've created a couple topics for this mock story map

493
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:41,205
where you have hygiene, self-care, you wake up,

494
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,007
there's dressing, breakfast, the gym,

495
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,528
transportation, arrival.

496
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:49,450
It's important while you generate these to communicate

497
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,250
with the group as well.

498
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:52,631
Make sure that everyone agrees that it

499
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,332
makes sense to group these things

500
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,813
underneath a particular backbone.

501
00:22:56,713 --> 00:23:00,395
It's much easier when you're doing the morning routine

502
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:01,876
than it is for other features.

503
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:05,477
So this is what the board would look like

504
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,778
after applying the backbone.

505
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,819
Again, this might be a little bit difficult to read,

506
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,660
but it's not important.

507
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,081
What is most important is that you can still

508
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,361
see the chronological order.

509
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:16,582
You can see the grouping.

510
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:22,982
And it's important to note that the person that goes first typically always has the truth

511
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:26,446
of the chronological order, and that's not really that important at this time.

512
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:31,672
So if somebody else eats breakfast before they brush their teeth or afterwards,

513
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:35,476
they're just going to wait a second and things will smooth out.

514
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:39,640
The next step is to order these by urgency.

515
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:42,638
So now that things are in chronological story order,

516
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,462
we then order things from top to bottom

517
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:48,727
for how important they are to how not important they are.

518
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,393
And if we do that, you see it like this.

519
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,580
So through each of these exercises,

520
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,641
it's OK for the whole group to get up and arrange

521
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,461
the stickies themselves.

522
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:03,022
They can move their own sticky notes.

523
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,662
They can move other people's sticky notes.

524
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,963
And facilitate a conversation around it as well.

525
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:12,505
So let people negotiate what they think should happen next,

526
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:13,725
or what is most important.

527
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:17,046
And then this is it zoomed in.

528
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:21,308
So these are now chronologically ordered, left to right,

529
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:23,108
and importance top to bottom.

530
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,292
So it's no surprise there might be some discussion about what's more important.

531
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,654
In one of these columns it says that you have to feed a baby,

532
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:34,215
and then there's another task that says you have to drink coffee.

533
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:38,277
And like your teammates might have not enough empathy to understand why one

534
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:39,478
of those is more important than the other.

535
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:43,020
But there's a conversation, negotiation that you have there.

536
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:49,570
But this leads to the next fun part, which is when, as the moderator, you tell the groom

537
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,791
that they're late for work and they only have 15 minutes to make this happen.

538
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:59,573
So you're going to put a constraint on them and say, draw a line below every sticky note,

539
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:06,715
and then you have people go to the board and move below that line everything they don't believe

540
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:10,336
is extremely important that they could get done within the 15-minute time.

541
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:14,719
and what you'll end up with is a board that looks like this.

542
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,083
Let them spend as much time negotiating and speaking

543
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:21,305
with each other, negotiating, moving cards.

544
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,387
It's important to remind people it's perfectly acceptable

545
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:28,129
to disagree, and that conflict is productive,

546
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:29,349
and it's not bad.

547
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,971
A lot of humans are really resistant to conflict,

548
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,793
and really all they are is a negotiation

549
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,454
and you figuring out together what's most important.

550
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,875
And this is a really good time to focus on that

551
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:42,037
if you're working with a team that has typically been

552
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:46,059
conflict-averse or aggressive with each other.

553
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:51,594
It's most important to point out that conflict that's respectful is productive,

554
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:55,257
and conflict that's not respectful is completely not productive.

555
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,221
So, everything above that line is going to form your first release.

556
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:05,605
A release isn't something that you always give to a player,

557
00:26:05,985 --> 00:26:11,069
or to show it to your CEO, or show it to your producer, or show it to your investor.

558
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:14,846
It's just something that gets the point across

559
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,549
of what that initial outcome was

560
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,731
that you were trying to deliver.

561
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:20,776
Everything above the line is that release

562
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:23,220
and everything below is something that we care about

563
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:24,943
but it's something that we'll probably do later.

564
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:32,683
So prioritizing this way is difficult because everyone has an idea about what's required

565
00:26:32,703 --> 00:26:33,524
that's slightly different.

566
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:36,806
And that's because those people in the room that I asked you to gather are diverse.

567
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:41,170
You may have younger people, you may have older people, married people, people with

568
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,512
families, people with cars, people without cars.

569
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:49,416
And the most important thing is that you group, you generate some personas.

570
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,507
Personas are just who's going to be using your product.

571
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,208
In this case, who's going to be having a morning routine.

572
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:59,629
So with our new goal of get ready in 15 minutes,

573
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:02,310
we're going to determine that we have bachelors,

574
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,811
we have married people, people with kids,

575
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:06,731
coffee drinkers, physical fit types,

576
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,912
breakfast lovers, and people with cars.

577
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:12,693
This may look different, I'm sorry,

578
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:13,934
this will completely look different

579
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,234
if you're building a real product,

580
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:18,935
but this should get the point across.

581
00:27:20,568 --> 00:27:22,510
Another problem here is prioritization around this.

582
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:24,632
So now we have these personas in these groups.

583
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:25,974
Who's most important?

584
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,478
So the old saying goes, if you try to please everyone,

585
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:31,399
you end up pleasing no one.

586
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,382
I'm just going to tell you that Guile said that because

587
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:37,305
apparently everyone on the internet has said this.

588
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,627
If you search for that, everyone's been attributed to

589
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:40,048
saying this.

590
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:43,271
It's better to declare complete bankruptcy than to

591
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:45,353
attribute it to somebody that did not actually say it.

592
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:49,950
So at this stage, encourage the group to optimize

593
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,910
for early adopters or beachhead users.

594
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,911
It's just easiest for this mock setup,

595
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,471
but that might not be always what you want to do

596
00:27:57,671 --> 00:27:59,191
for a real user story map.

597
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,252
You may have business constraints that say

598
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,572
that you must focus on particular players,

599
00:28:05,513 --> 00:28:06,953
and then you'll have to work back from there.

600
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:08,513
But for now, early adopters.

601
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,714
And this is a good part to remind people.

602
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,102
It is okay to disagree.

603
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,185
And it's especially gonna be difficult to align people

604
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,166
because you're working with smart, passionate people.

605
00:28:24,046 --> 00:28:27,248
What is not okay to do is disagree and not commit.

606
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:29,489
But it is very okay to disagree and commit.

607
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,431
On a team, you have to work together no matter what,

608
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:34,752
even if you do not think that the thing

609
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:36,473
that you're doing right now is the most important.

610
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:38,655
Once you walk out of the user story map,

611
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:40,536
everyone needs to commit to this idea

612
00:28:40,756 --> 00:28:42,217
and understand it's their idea as well,

613
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,858
and they need to be productive in explaining to everyone.

614
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,877
Anyone else that asks what they're building,

615
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,498
that this is what they're building.

616
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,619
Through these negotiations, I like

617
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:55,220
to use something called the 10 scale, which

618
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,721
is a way to help people understand how

619
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,462
important your idea is to you.

620
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:03,343
So 10 out of 10, I'm ready to die on this hill.

621
00:29:04,184 --> 00:29:05,784
So I think that we should do it this way,

622
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:06,865
and there's no other way.

623
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:09,726
1 out of 10, I have an idea that I can give you,

624
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:10,626
but I don't mind.

625
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:13,127
And somewhere in the middle is, I can go either way.

626
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,994
All right, so now that we've grouped the personas

627
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:19,735
and we've talked about what's most important,

628
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:22,156
we've think about who those early adopters are.

629
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:25,537
The easiest people to build this morning routine for

630
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:28,878
is people who are bachelors and people who have cars.

631
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:32,739
The people to the right aren't people we don't care about.

632
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,100
They're just that other group, that later group.

633
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,041
As our product gets more fleshed out,

634
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,422
then we can start focusing and building for them.

635
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:49,339
So after you've done this, ask the group to go back up to the

636
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:54,723
board and mark every activity with some sort of color marker.

637
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:59,007
Here I used a website called Mural, and there's these icons

638
00:29:59,027 --> 00:29:59,647
that you can see.

639
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:02,630
Or I'll show you zoomed in in a second here.

640
00:30:04,131 --> 00:30:05,933
And then if it's table stakes, it's up to you

641
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:06,853
to mark it or not.

642
00:30:07,494 --> 00:30:10,577
Table stakes is the most bare minimum, by the way.

643
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:13,459
So you need to wake up in the morning to be

644
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,200
able to go to work.

645
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,401
So we know that has to be there and that's for everyone.

646
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:22,345
But if we look zoomed in, these are tasks that are important,

647
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:25,167
but we've assigned to them personas.

648
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:28,289
So the bottle would be someone with a baby,

649
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:30,350
the ring would be someone with a marriage,

650
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:32,352
and we care about these people.

651
00:30:32,472 --> 00:30:34,273
We just can't care about them right now,

652
00:30:34,973 --> 00:30:36,615
because Guile told you you can't, right?

653
00:30:39,176 --> 00:30:40,898
So now if we take a look at the first milestone,

654
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:42,859
we'll see a pretty bare-bones morning routine.

655
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:47,788
You have to wake up, you take care of your medicine,

656
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:51,449
you brush your teeth, take a shower,

657
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,871
or no, actually, this one you just put deodorant on.

658
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,912
It's even easier to get ready for your morning.

659
00:30:58,112 --> 00:30:59,413
You get to work, get to your desk,

660
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:01,414
but this is extremely bare bones,

661
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,295
and like I said, this is just the first release.

662
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,076
Everything below that line,

663
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:08,937
this is what we would probably do later.

664
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,912
So this is usually as far as the mock user story session

665
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:18,874
goes, typically this will take about an hour

666
00:31:18,974 --> 00:31:20,415
depending on how many people you have in the room.

667
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:23,536
This isn't the end of a real user story map though.

668
00:31:24,277 --> 00:31:26,978
So I'll talk just a little bit more about how I continue

669
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:29,499
to get value from this and what the next steps are

670
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,161
if you were to use this in a real life scenario.

671
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:37,263
So from here you're gonna have a list of activities

672
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:38,484
and they're gonna be prioritized.

673
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:45,879
If I go back to the Moonrise case, we may have worked for three months and our initial,

674
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,021
you know, slice maybe is a login or not.

675
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:53,401
You know, maybe there's no back end system in any way.

676
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:57,382
You get to a menu system, you start fighting, that's slice one.

677
00:31:58,523 --> 00:32:04,064
And out of those features, what we might do is identify ones that are particularly large.

678
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,961
And then we might break those up into smaller pieces.

679
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:10,244
This is, by the way, particularly great to watch,

680
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:11,344
cross-discipline.

681
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:14,447
That's another reason why I highly recommend that you get

682
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:19,130
people, your artists in there, audio engineers, programmers,

683
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,712
producers, grab everyone that's interested.

684
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,038
not too big of a group by the way,

685
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:26,579
because past 10 is crazy.

686
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,462
But put them in a room and have them start breaking things up.

687
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:32,704
And what you realize is that an engineer might have

688
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:34,665
overestimated or underestimated something,

689
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,747
because they didn't realize that they appear somewhere

690
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:39,729
different in the pipeline than their peers do.

691
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:41,991
And potentially, there's dependencies that weren't

692
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:42,211
known.

693
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,494
So as you break these up, you start assigning work to each

694
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:48,655
other and estimating how long it takes.

695
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:56,459
This is a thing that normally you need done anyway.

696
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,681
If you're tracking work of any kind, you already do this.

697
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:01,162
Maybe you don't estimate, maybe you do.

698
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:04,063
You can leave that off as well if you're not looking into it,

699
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:05,344
interested in it.

700
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:09,967
But I think this is neat how the conversation that we were

701
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:10,267
having.

702
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:14,547
directly also translate into an artifact that helps me track our progress.

703
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:21,709
And then a conversation, every activity, every one of these cards is a conversation that I can have with the person that's assigned to,

704
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:25,690
or we can look at it and then as a group remember the story we were telling each other,

705
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,371
you know, walk up to a physical board and say, oh this is where we are right now,

706
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:31,391
and have a conversation around that ticket.

707
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:38,473
So, with that time constraint that we placed on people, the 15 minutes,

708
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,442
What we ended up trying to do here was looking at the state

709
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:45,244
of the world, understanding an idea we wanted to get to work

710
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:49,568
on time, and through minimizing the amount of

711
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:53,471
output, doing the least amount of work possible, how we could

712
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:54,692
have the outcome that we wanted.

713
00:33:55,673 --> 00:33:58,095
And then we looked at how to maximize our impact.

714
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:01,817
Impact is the people that you change the world for.

715
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,099
In this case, it's small.

716
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,582
We looked at bachelors and people that have vehicles.

717
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:09,265
In the next release, potentially we could

718
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,848
pull in some more features and have a larger impact.

719
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:17,934
But the key here is to deliver outcomes and ignore output.

720
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:23,114
A lot of times we measure output like velocity or burn down charts.

721
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:24,734
I just don't understand.

722
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:26,174
It's an anti-pattern.

723
00:34:26,354 --> 00:34:29,255
What you really want to do is measure if you made the impact

724
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:32,235
and it had the outcome that you desired.

725
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:35,456
Outcomes, a special word.

726
00:34:37,216 --> 00:34:39,337
It literally means what happens when it comes out.

727
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:43,317
And output is just what you did to get it there.

728
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:47,698
Outcomes are difficult to measure though because a lot

729
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,118
of times...

730
00:34:49,598 --> 00:34:51,440
you can only measure them when it comes out.

731
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:54,563
And that's why it's important to build less.

732
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,805
That's minimizing output.

733
00:34:58,146 --> 00:35:00,328
If your slices are smaller, you can deliver faster.

734
00:35:01,529 --> 00:35:03,010
You can then measure your outcome sooner.

735
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:05,192
So in the case of Moonrise,

736
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:08,055
we might have figured out before two years

737
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:10,597
that what we were building wasn't resonating

738
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,679
with the people we thought it was gonna be resonating with.

739
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:16,955
If instead we had been delivering much more rapidly,

740
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:18,977
maybe not to a complete audience,

741
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:22,060
but to user research groups and more regularly,

742
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:24,663
we might have figured out that we were just not

743
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:27,205
building the things that our players wanted.

744
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:31,189
This is why that metrics point is so important

745
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,251
on your product framing doc.

746
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:37,214
You already predefined that in the contract that everyone

747
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,057
agrees upon, we want to do this thing.

748
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:41,618
We want to have this outcome.

749
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,200
And this is how we're going to measure it.

750
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,641
It's all part of the framework.

751
00:35:45,302 --> 00:35:47,444
And that's again why I like to use an opportunity canvas,

752
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:50,726
because it presents a wall in your office that you can take

753
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:53,629
anyone to and walk them up to it and say, this is what our

754
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:54,890
vision is at a high level.

755
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,027
Another thing about building less is there's always more to build than you have time or

756
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:09,291
resources for. There's countless numbers of features that you could build, countless number

757
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:14,275
of enhancements that you can come up with, and there's a lot of different types of players.

758
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:20,920
So you could try to build something that satisfies everyone and it's just a billion dollar game,

759
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:27,786
but more money and more people don't equal a great product.

760
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,223
What we're attempting to do with this incremental approach

761
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:39,386
is deliver something I like to call a minimum viable solution.

762
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,368
A lot of people in this room probably have heard

763
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,609
of a minimum viable product.

764
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,591
The reason I don't like to use product

765
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,192
is because the idea that you're going

766
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:50,255
to deliver in a completed product

767
00:36:50,795 --> 00:36:53,157
means that there's room for somebody to say,

768
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:54,378
it's just not good enough yet.

769
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,040
A minimum viable solution focuses on

770
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:00,149
the literal minimum amount of work that we can do

771
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:02,632
to achieve the outcome that we said we wanted

772
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:06,316
for the people that we said we wanted to deliver it to.

773
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:15,599
So in this iterative approach, what you want to do

774
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,821
is make things useful from the start and better at each stage.

775
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:22,262
So you can see that the story had a beginning, middle,

776
00:37:22,302 --> 00:37:24,783
and end of our user story map.

777
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:26,363
It was small.

778
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:27,143
It was short.

779
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,704
And granted, I didn't even take a shower in it, right?

780
00:37:30,885 --> 00:37:32,005
But you could do it.

781
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:33,566
It accomplished the outcome.

782
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,806
You got to work under the constraint.

783
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:38,987
I like to use this diagram.

784
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:42,343
By the way, I didn't make these.

785
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:43,784
This is from Jeff Patton.

786
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:44,725
This is part of the book.

787
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:48,066
And these resonate extremely well with me.

788
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,549
So in this scenario, you were set out to build a car.

789
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:56,271
And if you look at the top, people

790
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,752
built it in pieces, complete pieces, the wheel first,

791
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,873
and the axle, and the wheels, and then the car,

792
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:02,774
and then the hood, and the car.

793
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:06,556
And the first three stages, the person wasn't happy.

794
00:38:08,177 --> 00:38:09,017
But if you look at the bottom.

795
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:12,448
This person thought about the outcome, which was,

796
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,349
I need transportation to get somewhere.

797
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:17,651
Now, a skateboard might not be unbelievably useful

798
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:20,353
to somebody if they have to go on a highway.

799
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,374
Like, you can't skate on a highway, right?

800
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,136
A scooter might be more useful to somebody

801
00:38:25,496 --> 00:38:28,438
if they have maybe a mile or a two mile long trip.

802
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:31,279
And then slowly you iterate to the bicycle,

803
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:32,580
the motorcycle, and then the car.

804
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:37,197
And the point here is that at any moment, you can release

805
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:41,299
and see if it accomplishes your goals.

806
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,280
You also might realize that you never

807
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,161
needed to build the car.

808
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:47,962
You thought everyone wanted the car, and then you deliver

809
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:50,303
something, and really all you ever needed to do

810
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:51,203
was build a bicycle.

811
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:54,325
So you don't waste.

812
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,206
You create less waste by following this methodology.

813
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,028
In each one of these releases, each one of these milestones.

814
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:03,963
Treat it like an experiment.

815
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:06,745
Do the least amount of work that you can,

816
00:39:07,685 --> 00:39:10,487
have the metrics ready to measure the outcome,

817
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:13,208
and then try to learn from that release.

818
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:18,490
I'm sure some of you here have seen this diagram before.

819
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,571
This is the validated learning loop.

820
00:39:21,412 --> 00:39:24,113
So you build your minimum viable solution.

821
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:26,494
You measure that minimum viable solution

822
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:27,435
against a group of people.

823
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:28,895
Maybe it's external.

824
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:29,756
Maybe it's internal.

825
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:30,896
Maybe it's your QA folks.

826
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:32,297
Maybe it's friends and family.

827
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:36,063
Then you take that data and you learn from it.

828
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:39,244
You look at it and say, are we still doing what we should be

829
00:39:39,284 --> 00:39:39,524
doing?

830
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:42,025
Avoid a flat backlog.

831
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:44,505
Don't let somebody tell you, here's what we're doing for

832
00:39:44,545 --> 00:39:45,005
four years.

833
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:49,886
Because I guarantee you, if you have a release and it

834
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:51,667
takes you three months to get it out, you're going to learn

835
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,087
so much from that that the ideas that you had three

836
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:55,267
months ago are no longer good.

837
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:57,228
Or only some of them are.

838
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,988
Or they're still good, but they're not good for right

839
00:39:59,028 --> 00:39:59,128
now.

840
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,502
That's why all of these documents are mutable.

841
00:40:04,183 --> 00:40:06,885
You can change any one of them, even the product

842
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,488
framing doc, even the opportunity canvas.

843
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,369
You can just burn it, make a new one.

844
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,974
Because you learned from outputting and

845
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:17,835
measuring the outcome.

846
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:24,620
So using user story mapping, you'll end up building with an

847
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,561
incremental strategy.

848
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:31,360
This was a strategy that I was looking for when I was building Moonrise.

849
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:36,545
I wanted to know why my product was failing much earlier, or I wanted to know that it

850
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:39,127
would fail so that way I could prevent it from happening.

851
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:45,813
Had I known that it was going to fail, we wouldn't have run out of runway.

852
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:49,457
We would have iterated and pivoted and worked on different features.

853
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:55,467
This solution, this tool, this framework to get people together was exactly what I was looking for.

854
00:40:56,207 --> 00:41:00,530
One of the reasons I really appreciated it was there's an actual book that you can give to people about this.

855
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,172
You can get on a stage and tell people about it and tell them to go read about it.

856
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:08,975
We could go out in the hall after this and anyone here could come up with a feature

857
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,196
and we'll do a user story mapping session about it.

858
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:14,118
It's really easy to get to do.

859
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:21,388
So building software, especially entertainment software,

860
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:22,169
is a big task.

861
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,433
It takes a lot of time, sometimes two to four years.

862
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:28,536
You could theoretically be waiting quite a while

863
00:41:28,596 --> 00:41:29,718
before you can measure an outcome.

864
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:34,750
It's because of this that you shouldn't aim to complete things step by step,

865
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:39,274
or complete things in a way that a gif would load in the mid-90s.

866
00:41:40,535 --> 00:41:42,778
Instead, think of how Van Gogh made the Mona Lisa.

867
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:47,802
He set out to have an outcome of painting a picture of a lady, a fine lady, right?

868
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:56,010
And he sketches it quick, fills it in, and the whole way you can kind of see the picture.

869
00:41:56,802 --> 00:42:00,022
And because of this, it's also a place that people can gather around.

870
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,003
Imagine this like a game.

871
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:04,344
You know, you don't have the entire thing in place.

872
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:09,505
There's a bunch of debug text or, you know, the UI is not right,

873
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:13,306
or, you know, you're using other games artwork temporarily, whatever it is.

874
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:17,047
But you can still see the vague picture of what's going to exist in the end.

875
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:20,748
I guarantee you, if you do it this way, you'll have less waste.

876
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:27,730
So if I bored you through this, or if you're scrubbing

877
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,291
through at home, I hope you hear just this part

878
00:42:31,411 --> 00:42:32,471
in these next couple slides.

879
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:37,173
The reason I continue to story map is, like I said,

880
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:39,033
it has a book, and I can teach it to people.

881
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:42,714
But it resonated well with me because it's around

882
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:46,396
building teams, and it's around aligning under a same goal.

883
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,417
It becomes let's build our game,

884
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:50,897
and not let me build your game.

885
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:54,637
It also makes sure that you produce less waste.

886
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,459
You just simply build less when you use a method like this.

887
00:42:57,979 --> 00:43:00,401
And because it's a framework, everyone can agree upon it.

888
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:03,744
There's no thought about what you should do next.

889
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:09,309
One, the most important thing that it does for me

890
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,571
is it tells me exactly what I should build first.

891
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:15,374
You basically pick out what the table stakes things are,

892
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,976
who the people are, who are you building it for,

893
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,718
what do they expect, and then what you should build next.

894
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:26,502
It also gives you a space, like codified into your culture,

895
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,224
about bringing in alternate points of view.

896
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:31,646
So instead of the programmers all getting together

897
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:34,188
and solving a problem in a way that programmers would,

898
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:35,810
I can say that by the way, because I'm a programmer.

899
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:40,273
You pull in other folks and hear how they would solve it.

900
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:42,794
You start understanding what their problems are.

901
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:45,296
And then you start empathizing with those people as well.

902
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,698
And it makes you more inclined to want to help them

903
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:49,799
and have less arguments about who's right

904
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,681
or what vision's appropriate.

905
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,223
If you fill in the blind spots that you have,

906
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:56,524
if you bring in other ideas.

907
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:00,747
The third is that buy-in.

908
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:02,448
I had said this a couple times.

909
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:04,509
We're building our game.

910
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:05,770
I'm not building your game.

911
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,046
Nobody wants to just build your game.

912
00:44:10,086 --> 00:44:12,306
People want to feel like they have purpose in the workplace.

913
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,867
And your product will have more soul

914
00:44:16,507 --> 00:44:17,587
if there's more ideas in it.

915
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:20,768
This wasn't part of the talk,

916
00:44:20,828 --> 00:44:22,328
but I actually want to give a small analogy

917
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:25,509
about why diverse minds are really important in a room.

918
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:27,549
So,

919
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,650
Apple designed a glass staircase

920
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,551
and they put it in one of their stores.

921
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,161
It was summertime.

922
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:41,584
And they were wondering why the second floor just wasn't

923
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:44,526
getting used, or why particularly demographics were

924
00:44:44,546 --> 00:44:46,427
not going and buying things on the second floor.

925
00:44:48,028 --> 00:44:50,770
What they found out through polling people is that they

926
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,532
put a glass staircase in summer in a place that gets

927
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:57,115
warm, and then women didn't want to use it because they

928
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:59,396
walk up a glass staircase and there's people standing under

929
00:44:59,456 --> 00:45:02,018
it, potentially, or kids standing down there, right?

930
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:07,157
That was an idea that a particular set of minds had,

931
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:10,160
and yeah, it's cool, but if other people with other ideas

932
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,182
were in that room, they would have probably never

933
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:12,883
had that problem.

934
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:16,707
That is a very visual representation

935
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:19,831
of something I keep seeing when we're building games

936
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,552
and only certain minds are in the room.

937
00:45:25,406 --> 00:45:27,947
The last thing, and this is pretty much the title of the talk,

938
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:30,388
is that I keep using user story mapping

939
00:45:30,508 --> 00:45:32,850
because it helps me build a shared understanding with people.

940
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:34,870
This takes time,

941
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:37,952
and it could be someone's sole job

942
00:45:38,032 --> 00:45:39,693
to make sure that everyone, every day,

943
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:41,374
understands what we're building.

944
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:45,035
But it's better than finding out two years into the development process

945
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:48,757
that everyone looks like they understand what they're building.

946
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:51,218
That's more dangerous than not knowing,

947
00:45:51,398 --> 00:45:53,759
because if you don't know, it's a lot easier to correct you.

948
00:45:55,057 --> 00:45:59,681
But making this part of your process codified in means that I guarantee you in two years,

949
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,602
you're not going to ask people, hey, what are we building?

950
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:05,305
And they all have different ideas about who they're building it for and what they're building.

951
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:08,308
If you get nothing else from this talk,

952
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:11,691
understand that stories aren't a written form of requirements.

953
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:15,253
This isn't a way that you now describe to people what they must do.

954
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,956
And stories aren't the requirements.

955
00:46:19,054 --> 00:46:21,314
These are just conversations that we can tell each other

956
00:46:21,354 --> 00:46:23,435
in chronological order in a way

957
00:46:23,475 --> 00:46:25,856
that we can arrange them visually in a place

958
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:27,236
that we can go have conversations

959
00:46:27,316 --> 00:46:29,257
about each task or activity.

960
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,758
Stories encourage those conversations,

961
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:34,639
those interactions and questions,

962
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,359
which lead to better understanding.

963
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,561
A map is literally just how you figure out,

964
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:43,822
let me do this one more time, how you build a map.

965
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:46,156
is by finding the edges.

966
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:49,803
And that is the same way as solving complicated problems.

967
00:46:50,063 --> 00:46:52,808
Find all of the edges, agree upon the edges,

968
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:55,833
and then let people fill that space with the solutions.

969
00:46:58,254 --> 00:47:01,836
So here's some resources if you want to do this on your own.

970
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:06,419
Mural.co is the tool that I use to generate those slides

971
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:07,459
with the sticky notes on them.

972
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,561
I've worked on remote teams before,

973
00:47:10,281 --> 00:47:13,744
and I've used that quite a bit in lieu of a physical place

974
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:15,064
that we could get in a room.

975
00:47:15,805 --> 00:47:17,846
I do highly recommend getting in a room, though.

976
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:20,228
There's three levels of communication

977
00:47:20,508 --> 00:47:21,388
that I escalate through.

978
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:22,669
One, text.

979
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:23,750
Is it quick?

980
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:24,971
Is it not going to hurt your feelings?

981
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:25,911
I'll send you a quick message.

982
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:26,852
Two.

983
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:34,407
voice. Can I convey that I'm not being a bad guy by giving this information over voice?

984
00:47:34,608 --> 00:47:39,232
And then the third is video or in person, and that's when you're really going to have

985
00:47:39,372 --> 00:47:44,116
potentially conversations that have conflict. Anyway.

986
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:48,005
The next is Jeff Patton and Associates.

987
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:48,906
That's his website.

988
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:53,351
Literally, I wouldn't be up here talking about this if

989
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:57,536
Jeff Patton hadn't come up with these ideas, written

990
00:47:57,576 --> 00:47:59,919
about them, come and presented to them.

991
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,363
So I have a lot of thanks to deliver to him and Adam Jacob

992
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:06,206
and the other developers that I worked with at Chef.

993
00:48:08,612 --> 00:48:10,775
So again, I'm Jamie Windsor.

994
00:48:12,037 --> 00:48:14,720
You can see me on Twitter there, and that's my email.

995
00:48:15,822 --> 00:48:17,904
I really appreciate everyone coming, and thank you to the

996
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:20,548
AV team here and the staff helping me out.

997
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,105
I hope you guys have a great rest of your day.

998
00:48:23,845 --> 00:48:26,267
But before I let you go, we got 10 minutes left.

999
00:48:27,148 --> 00:48:32,191
First, I'd really like to ask you guys and gals to please

1000
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:33,432
rate the talk if you can.

1001
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,174
Negative feedback, positive feedback, it doesn't matter.

1002
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:38,395
It's very useful for us.

1003
00:48:39,556 --> 00:48:42,958
And next, if anyone has any questions, we can do a Q&A.

1004
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,102
Hey, how's it going? Great talk.

1005
00:49:01,644 --> 00:49:01,965
Thank you.

1006
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,030
Can you do me a favor and just say who you are

1007
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,193
and where you're from and that's it?

1008
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:05,554
Oh yeah, sure.

1009
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:07,199
My name is James, I'm at Adobe.

1010
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:11,421
And you talked about the diverse people in the room,

1011
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:15,204
and the example of how everyone gets ready for work

1012
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,825
is great because everyone has a very similar experience

1013
00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:18,125
like that.

1014
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:20,227
But when you're talking about a product feature

1015
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:22,468
or a product in general, you're bringing engineers,

1016
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:23,969
you're bringing designers, you're bringing whomever

1017
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:24,869
that might be in there.

1018
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:28,792
How do you balance out the product requirements

1019
00:49:28,852 --> 00:49:30,533
and you being the product person and knowing

1020
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:32,454
that there's a vision based on your expertise

1021
00:49:32,494 --> 00:49:34,435
and user understanding versus...

1022
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:38,238
what an engineer is gonna bring and how do you kind of

1023
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,600
include them in those talks but at the same time

1024
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,602
keeping it focused on what you know to be

1025
00:49:43,922 --> 00:49:45,924
the direction and path you want the product to go in?

1026
00:49:46,344 --> 00:49:46,845
Absolutely.

1027
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:50,247
Okay, so because that's recorded,

1028
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:51,808
I'm not gonna repeat the whole thing back.

1029
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:54,691
But the idea is how do you align other people

1030
00:49:56,012 --> 00:49:57,873
with a vision instead of letting it

1031
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,054
kind of get off the rails, right?

1032
00:49:59,975 --> 00:50:00,395
Okay, so.

1033
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,875
That product framing doc or an opportunity canvas acts as a contract.

1034
00:50:07,097 --> 00:50:10,621
Just be welcoming to people and say, hey, this is the problem we're trying to solve.

1035
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:12,644
People love solving problems.

1036
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,606
I think that's why people play games, by the way.

1037
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:17,149
Literally, games are just problems that you're solving, right?

1038
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,591
It's the difference between a game and a toy.

1039
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,433
And engineers really like solving problems too.

1040
00:50:24,113 --> 00:50:25,874
So if you show them the state of the world

1041
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:28,035
and say, how can we fix this, and this

1042
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:30,857
is the outcome that I want, it's going to happen.

1043
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:31,797
It's very rare.

1044
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:33,998
You have to have a very particular cynical type of person

1045
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:35,559
who's like, fuck that data.

1046
00:50:36,439 --> 00:50:37,800
I completely disagree.

1047
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,641
Oh, shit.

1048
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:38,961
Sorry.

1049
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:40,541
Again, too.

1050
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:41,722
Those are my elements.

1051
00:50:41,762 --> 00:50:41,862
Yeah.

1052
00:50:45,307 --> 00:50:46,588
Aligning people around the problem

1053
00:50:46,988 --> 00:50:48,868
and getting them excited to go do it

1054
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:51,109
often will just kind of cut it off at the head.

1055
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:53,750
But it's true that games are subjective

1056
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,111
and that is where you, I use that 10 scale quite a bit.

1057
00:50:58,231 --> 00:51:00,291
Like look, we all have to be reasonable here.

1058
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,752
I hear you like it blue.

1059
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:05,673
We're gonna go with red for a little while.

1060
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:08,534
Always try to have metrics though

1061
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:09,594
that you can fall back on.

1062
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:10,834
Thank you.

1063
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:11,915
Yeah, no problem, thank you.

1064
00:51:16,217 --> 00:51:18,760
I'm Alfreda from Wizards of the Coast.

1065
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:24,487
I'm just curious how you either modify this for larger teams

1066
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:28,892
or figure out who the most important 10 people are

1067
00:51:28,932 --> 00:51:30,454
to be in the room, because you said a limit of 10.

1068
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:32,617
Yes, that's a great question.

1069
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:38,100
So I like to limit these to about 10 to 12 people.

1070
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:40,682
And it's kind of hierarchical.

1071
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:43,564
So not hierarchy like how important you are

1072
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:45,266
or what your title is.

1073
00:51:45,746 --> 00:51:48,688
It's just people that are excited or interested,

1074
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:49,989
people that have free time right now,

1075
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,971
people that agree to the team contract

1076
00:51:53,232 --> 00:51:55,513
that want to form a core team around,

1077
00:51:57,226 --> 00:51:59,168
a core team around that vision.

1078
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:01,250
They wanna deliver those outcomes

1079
00:52:02,191 --> 00:52:05,274
and then slowly break it out even more.

1080
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:07,577
So that was one board

1081
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:10,180
and it was like hard to fit that on a slide.

1082
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,923
What you're gonna end up with

1083
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:15,245
is all of your walls are gonna be covered in this

1084
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:16,286
if you really adopted it.

1085
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:19,648
And you have teams break off and build features.

1086
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:22,530
And then you kind of just set a larger hierarchy.

1087
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:27,255
And someone's a product owner, or a producer, or a product

1088
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:28,556
manager, or a product line manager.

1089
00:52:29,577 --> 00:52:32,319
And it's that person's job to make sure that communication's

1090
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,481
flowing between each team.

1091
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:38,217
The core group, say you were building a brand new product

1092
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:41,478
right now, limit it to 10, and then as you're doing

1093
00:52:41,498 --> 00:52:44,518
the rock breaking process, start realizing there's

1094
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:47,079
epic tasks that you can then give to other teams,

1095
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,540
and then form another 10 person team around it

1096
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,920
and say, this is the problem that we're trying

1097
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,780
to solve for this, are you guys ready for this?

1098
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:55,241
And gals, are you ready for this?

1099
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:56,901
And if they are, they'll get excited

1100
00:52:56,921 --> 00:52:58,141
and they'll start doing that as well.

1101
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:03,363
Anything more than 10 is chaos, in my experience.

1102
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:04,003
Thank you.

1103
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:04,623
No problem.

1104
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,291
Hi, Annie Vandermeer, Mitsoda Systemera.

1105
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:14,573
As you know, it's an unfortunate truth of our industry

1106
00:53:14,613 --> 00:53:15,873
that there's a lot of turnover.

1107
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:18,494
How would you adapt this methodology

1108
00:53:19,054 --> 00:53:20,894
when there's been turnover and you're

1109
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:23,955
trying to bring on a new person in an onboarding process,

1110
00:53:24,055 --> 00:53:27,656
especially somebody who might be in a higher sort of level,

1111
00:53:27,676 --> 00:53:29,417
like a lead has been replaced?

1112
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,597
Yeah, that's tough.

1113
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:34,798
But if

1114
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:38,539
Everyone has the story and everyone knows how to,

1115
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,581
and it's lofty to think everyone will, by the way.

1116
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:45,083
You can't have only one person holding that vision

1117
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:46,184
and being more near the center.

1118
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:48,785
Or as you go out in a layered approach,

1119
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:51,407
you can't have just one person being able

1120
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:52,667
to carry the torch at that layer.

1121
00:53:54,428 --> 00:53:54,589
But.

1122
00:53:56,227 --> 00:54:02,870
I don't find that, or it has not been my experience, that I've lost one person and then the entire

1123
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,171
project couldn't be completed.

1124
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:09,793
And it's mostly been better because it's more distributed in this way.

1125
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:13,680
One of the things that it has helped for onboarding with,

1126
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:17,763
no one goes and reads a wiki article that was written two

1127
00:54:17,803 --> 00:54:20,525
years ago, which is completely out of date now, and then has

1128
00:54:20,585 --> 00:54:21,926
a different idea of what we're building.

1129
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:25,429
Instead, they can look at that photo, that small thing, and

1130
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:26,990
then they have a bunch of questions about it.

1131
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,853
And then they get the more up-to-date information by

1132
00:54:31,373 --> 00:54:33,415
chatting with people in the room.

1133
00:54:34,736 --> 00:54:35,836
Is that satisfactory?

1134
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:36,337
Is that OK?

1135
00:54:36,937 --> 00:54:37,618
That is totally OK.

1136
00:54:37,638 --> 00:54:38,178
Thank you.

1137
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:42,379
Hi Jamie, thanks for the talk.

1138
00:54:42,439 --> 00:54:43,500
I'm Nicole from Zynga.

1139
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,801
I like your reference of design documents

1140
00:54:47,841 --> 00:54:48,742
are like photographs.

1141
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:51,102
So after this process is concluded,

1142
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,923
what do you recommend teams actually do document?

1143
00:54:57,524 --> 00:55:01,348
I would use the product frame or an opportunity canvas as that photo.

1144
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:06,993
The most important things, like I said, at the kernel are what you want your outcomes

1145
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:10,457
to be, why you're doing it, who the people are, and the metrics to measure it.

1146
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:14,241
But from there, you're going to be creating entertainment software, right?

1147
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:21,088
and then small slices about describing that feature.

1148
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:24,551
And again, you can product frame features.

1149
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,853
You don't have to just product frame the product.

1150
00:55:27,294 --> 00:55:28,675
You could then go along and say,

1151
00:55:28,735 --> 00:55:30,417
okay, this is this particular system.

1152
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,819
We're building a...

1153
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:39,694
a card game and I'm trying to figure out a particular mechanism for cards,

1154
00:55:41,194 --> 00:55:43,235
how we deal or how we manage with resources.

1155
00:55:44,296 --> 00:55:48,637
And you can have a smaller version of that for just that feature team.

1156
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:50,598
Thank you.

1157
00:55:51,038 --> 00:55:51,478
Absolutely.

1158
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:55,907
Hi, my name's Kyle.

1159
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:57,027
I'm from Codemasters.

1160
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,748
And I'm currently trying to work out how I word this question

1161
00:56:00,768 --> 00:56:01,849
without sounding like a crazy person.

1162
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:05,770
So in the example that you gave, you

1163
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,011
were highlighting commonalities in the backbone.

1164
00:56:09,712 --> 00:56:13,113
Do you also go through a process of if there are, say,

1165
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:16,434
users that have diametrically opposed opinions or ideas,

1166
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,095
do you highlight conflict as well?

1167
00:56:18,215 --> 00:56:19,856
And then if you do, what do you then do with it?

1168
00:56:20,136 --> 00:56:21,496
Yes, absolutely.

1169
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,981
That does happen, especially more when you're building

1170
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:28,382
entertainment software, right?

1171
00:56:28,662 --> 00:56:30,723
Those are must-have conversations.

1172
00:56:31,643 --> 00:56:33,744
And then it's really important that there's

1173
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:35,985
another party present who isn't one

1174
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:37,706
of the people with that idea.

1175
00:56:37,986 --> 00:56:40,267
So as a moderator, you shouldn't take a side.

1176
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,088
Hear each side out.

1177
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:45,009
And then as a group, let the group

1178
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,970
try to figure out what they should commit on.

1179
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:50,872
If you, as a moderator, know that.

1180
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:54,666
the thing being suggested is gonna be a tire fire.

1181
00:56:55,907 --> 00:56:56,827
You should then be like,

1182
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,309
hey, I'm 10 out of 10 on this, man.

1183
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:00,451
I really don't think we should do this.

1184
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,753
Is it okay if we don't do it right now?

1185
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:05,035
And by appealing to that person

1186
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:07,236
who has the completely opposing idea,

1187
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,338
a lot of times they're pretty reasonable,

1188
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:10,960
as long as you're in person.

1189
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,102
If you do this over text, it ain't happening.

1190
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:14,903
Thank you.

1191
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,684
Absolutely.

1192
00:57:20,297 --> 00:57:22,538
Hi, I'm Andy Martin with Moonlight Games.

1193
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:27,402
I get in meetings all the time with our executive staff

1194
00:57:27,562 --> 00:57:31,245
where the meeting sort of ends in I understand or I

1195
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:32,206
completely agree.

1196
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,689
And instead of really meaning I completely agree, it's just

1197
00:57:35,729 --> 00:57:37,530
kind of a way to table the topic.

1198
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:41,814
Do you have any ideas of how to solve

1199
00:57:41,874 --> 00:57:42,914
those types of problems?

1200
00:57:43,195 --> 00:57:44,916
Yeah, don't put people in meeting jail.

1201
00:57:47,073 --> 00:57:49,656
Make sure meetings only last a certain amount of time.

1202
00:57:50,277 --> 00:57:52,360
I use 25 minutes and 55 minutes,

1203
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:55,604
because I like to give people five minutes in between

1204
00:57:55,704 --> 00:57:59,849
to go to the restroom, or I just need time sometimes

1205
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:01,131
to sit there and think of nothing.

1206
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,539
But don't keep people in a room much past that,

1207
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:06,980
because they will tap out.

1208
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:12,464
And then you'll only have the ideas of the people

1209
00:58:12,484 --> 00:58:15,527
with the longest endurance for putting up with meetings.

1210
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,929
So do use a story mapping session.

1211
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,991
If you don't complete it, it's OK.

1212
00:58:21,151 --> 00:58:22,052
It's all on a board.

1213
00:58:22,452 --> 00:58:23,233
Come back the next day.

1214
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:27,296
And keep checking with people.

1215
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,142
you know, check in with them, ask them if they like it.

1216
00:58:30,622 --> 00:58:31,803
Don't do it in front of everyone else,

1217
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:34,265
but pull them aside, say, are you finding value in this?

1218
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:38,969
And again, if they're not, but you're a nice guy,

1219
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,311
a lot of times people will,

1220
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,012
there's a social currency that goes with it,

1221
00:58:43,032 --> 00:58:44,433
you say, can you give me a little bit more time?

1222
00:58:45,714 --> 00:58:48,616
But don't let yourself get burnt out in a meeting

1223
00:58:49,077 --> 00:58:52,960
and make a policy that if you're not finding value in it,

1224
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,780
you can just walk out.

1225
00:58:55,021 --> 00:58:55,902
Cool, yeah.

1226
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,511
All right, I think that's it.

1227
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:03,558
That's time as well.

1228
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,283
Thank you everyone for coming.

1229
00:59:05,344 --> 00:59:06,166
I really appreciate it.
