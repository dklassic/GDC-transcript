1
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:12,467
I hope it's a useful talk. That would be nice. My name is Chris.

2
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:16,089
I'm the creative director and artist at Red Hook Studios and

3
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:19,970
worked on Darkest Dungeon. I wanted to start really quick by

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,152
just saying it's a very humbling experience to be able to stand

5
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:25,233
up here. I've learned a lot from GDC and especially from a lot

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,094
of people that I see in the audience that are people that I

7
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,736
look up to. So hopefully I can give something back. Okay. So

8
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:33,196
enough of kissing ass.

9
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:38,801
So after three years working on darkest dungeon from Tyler

10
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,783
Sigmund and I and a bottle of scotch in my living room

11
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:45,967
through all the way to early access and to finishing, this

12
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:49,550
idea kind of took hold in my mind. Essentially that

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,514
development is a lot like being in a dungeon crawl. You form a

14
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:57,817
party of skilled adventurers. You equip yourself with the

15
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:58,818
best gear. For us like

16
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:02,513
workflow, methodology, competencies, great ideas,

17
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:05,754
and then you basically plunge headlong

18
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:08,756
into this sprawling abyss of uncertainty

19
00:01:08,756 --> 00:01:11,137
for the next couple years of your life,

20
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,258
running out of money, ruining your relationships,

21
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:15,459
and all the rest of it.

22
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:18,160
It's a, what's that?

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,701
Yeah, too soon.

24
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,183
No, it's going better, it is.

25
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:31,101
development, for all of you guys, you guys know this, it

26
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,803
can be paralyzing because you're faced with making like constant

27
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:36,784
choices with consequences you don't never fully really

28
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:41,046
understand until it's too late. And the landscape is always

29
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:43,467
changing and you're always operating with imperfect

30
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:47,188
information essentially. And I have come to believe that based

31
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:50,270
on my experience on this game, if you go into this development

32
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,451
dungeon without a strong creative vision for your game,

33
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:54,952
you're essentially going in torchless.

34
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:02,817
So what is creative direction? I think it's a lot of things to a

35
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:06,379
lot of people. You could call it like the thematic and conceptual

36
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,101
framework of the game. You could call it the DNA that runs

37
00:02:09,101 --> 00:02:12,802
through all the sort of soft sciences, you know, narrative

38
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:18,025
game design, art, music, audio. It's a very nebulous and

39
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:23,168
amorphous concept. And I think a lot of times it gets ignored for

40
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:26,870
that reason or not talked about in practical terms.

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,651
I think on big projects, you know, when you get face to face

42
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,052
with sort of the realities of development, the pillars and the

43
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:38,113
vision documents, they just live on the drive somewhere and

44
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:40,313
because there's no time to go back to that stuff. It doesn't,

45
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,034
it's not relevant anymore. And on a smaller project, you're

46
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:46,255
like, well, maybe I don't need it because our game's about

47
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,556
jumping. So let's just make the jumping really good. But I, I

48
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:52,097
respectfully disagree. I think that the misconception that it's

49
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:55,198
a nebulous and intangible notion.

50
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:59,562
is a missed opportunity for indie developers.

51
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:00,763
For us, it was a practical tool.

52
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,086
It was something that we consulted and referred to

53
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:05,407
constantly throughout our development,

54
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:06,688
and it served us really well.

55
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,343
we're small teams. We don't have a lot of money when we get

56
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:17,665
started. We can't afford to just arbitrarily bloat scope or add

57
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:22,507
parkour on Sunday morning to the game. It doesn't work for us. I

58
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:26,468
think that we have to be more focused and

59
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:32,391
deliver tighter experiences by necessity. And in order to do

60
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:37,134
that successfully, we need to make sure that we align all the

61
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:41,117
elements in our game to deliver on those thematic beats or we

62
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:47,200
risk losing our way in development. For us on this

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,101
game, what am I, 38, 39? Pushing 40.

64
00:03:51,256 --> 00:03:53,598
The opportunity cost was extremely high.

65
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,259
So actually before Tyler and I kicked off the game,

66
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,980
both of us had had job interviews

67
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,502
and there were offers on the table.

68
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:04,505
I have a wife and children and a mortgage and an iPad now.

69
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,606
That's cool.

70
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:11,489
And you know, it costs a lot and it's a huge risk

71
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,791
when you're at that sort of stage in your life.

72
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,653
So for me, it was really important to clearly understand

73
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:17,874
the game we were going to make

74
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:19,415
so that I didn't wake up one morning,

75
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:20,415
like eight months later.

76
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:24,970
completely depleted of my career's worth of savings

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,710
and wonder like, wait a second,

78
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,572
what is this game actually about?

79
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:32,493
And so we invested early and intensely

80
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:36,295
in clearly understanding the game's creative direction.

81
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:40,017
And we looked back on it at every sort of decision point.

82
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,471
We've gotten a lot of great feedback on Darkest Dungeon,

83
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,211
a lot of really positive comments, which are awesome,

84
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,792
about how the atmosphere and the thematics

85
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,253
all sort of like, all the features funnel in together

86
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:53,754
to deliver this sort of singular experience.

87
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:55,655
And that's great, but it wasn't by accident.

88
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:59,537
It was basically a function of how we approached

89
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:00,437
looking at the game.

90
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:03,458
So consider this like horrible looking tree.

91
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:08,620
In the soil you put all your ideas and your inspirations and your influences.

92
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:17,409
So like classic CRPGs and comic books and sad music and HP Lovecraft and just the earth

93
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,472
that the game is going to kind of grow out of.

94
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:27,419
And through a process of debate and discussion, you arrive at the trunk of the game.

95
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,380
I'm going to skip ahead here.

96
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,824
the clearly defined vision that's going to create a

97
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,565
framework for you to move forward.

98
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:36,967
And from that trunk, the branches grow out,

99
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,207
all the different disciplines.

100
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,768
So design can head off in its area

101
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:41,330
and face its own challenges.

102
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,011
Art can do the same, audio, writing.

103
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,012
But if you trace them back far enough,

104
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,813
they all share an ancestry.

105
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,595
Which I think, looking at the project this way,

106
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:52,277
gave us a really great place to start.

107
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,439
And no matter what challenges we face later,

108
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,021
we can always come back to this trunk that we built.

109
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:04,431
sort of a clearly defined and articulated vision statement for the game.

110
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,922
We did this a couple of different ways.

111
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,823
The old collect a bunch of reference art,

112
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:15,626
put it on an image, classic, classic move.

113
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,288
But putting, like annotating it with what about those images

114
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:21,669
is really important, I think, because it's not enough just

115
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,771
to stick a picture somewhere.

116
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,332
We had a lot of conversation and debate.

117
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:28,834
We stress tested what we felt like the game would be about

118
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:31,355
and how the game would handle certain problems

119
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,336
as they popped up.

120
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:33,457
And we ended up with this.

121
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:36,859
uncompromising, gothic rogue-like, low fantasy,

122
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:41,282
Lovecraftian adventure that challenges players to make the

123
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:44,984
best of a bad situation and make decisions with permanent

124
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:48,367
consequences with imperfect information. And that really

125
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,769
became the sort of core vision for the game and everything was

126
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:52,630
routed through that.

127
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:57,428
And I wanted to point out I think the love child metaphor.

128
00:06:57,428 --> 00:07:00,291
Thanks Jeff for clarifying what that actually is.

129
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,491
You know when you're like,

130
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,613
oh my game is X meets Y.

131
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:05,855
For us it became like XCOM meets Dark Souls.

132
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:07,937
I think that's nice to arrive at at the end of the day

133
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:10,499
after you've gone through a more exhaustive process

134
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,400
of understanding what it is you're trying to make.

135
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,962
But if you start from there, I think it's really reductive.

136
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:15,963
And I think that you risk,

137
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:17,984
like if that's your internal mantra

138
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,005
is XCOM meets Dark Souls.

139
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,468
It's not specific enough because you're not saying what about XCOM you're taking and leaving

140
00:07:23,468 --> 00:07:26,230
and what about Dark Souls you're taking and leaving.

141
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,712
It's just up to personal interpretation.

142
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:34,155
And I guess that's what I'm really driving at is that when you settle on a creative direction

143
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:36,697
for your game, it cannot be subject to a personal interpretation.

144
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,698
It needs to be strong enough to exist on its own.

145
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:40,059
So I did this drawing of Batman.

146
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:45,489
I think what worked really well for us

147
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,613
by defining this vision for the game,

148
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,397
repeatedly articulating it, and actively looking

149
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:53,442
for ways to involve it in our development process,

150
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,566
it kind of became its own.

151
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,021
entity. We externalized it. Darkest Dungeon became a team

152
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,265
member. It wasn't what I thought was cool or what Tyler thought

153
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:08,109
would work. The game was a part of our team. And it had its own

154
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,291
likes and dislikes and things that it wanted to be and things

155
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,934
that it didn't need. Like parkour.

156
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,910
So it's a lot like Batman and Bruce Wayne.

157
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,211
The creative director is a man, or a woman, obviously.

158
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:24,813
You can be sort of swayed by shifting trends.

159
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:28,535
You can wake up one morning after you play a great round

160
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:30,556
of Fallout 4, and now you want to have power armor in your

161
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:32,016
racing game.

162
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:34,998
You're vulnerable to these things as a person, just by

163
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,919
the nature of, especially a creative person, right?

164
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,839
We're very easily attracted to neat ideas.

165
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,501
But the creative direction for a game has to be a symbol.

166
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:45,462
It has to be immutable and powerful

167
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,682
and outside of yourself.

168
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:49,123
And Batman's really cool.

169
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:50,884
I could have chosen a different superhero,

170
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:53,545
but it wouldn't have been a great creative choice given

171
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,405
the talk, subject matter.

172
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:56,966
So yeah, essentially, the thing has

173
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,846
to be strong enough to live on its own and fight crime.

174
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:04,708
So being, you know, moving into production with the confidence

175
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,909
of what we knew what we wanted to make led to some really

176
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:09,749
interesting choices. So what I thought I would do is

177
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,450
demonstrate the practical application of creative

178
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,890
direction by just sort of selecting a few sort of key

179
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,391
examples. Like I said, it was literally something we talked

180
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,852
about all the time. But

181
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,818
the art style, the overall presentation of the game, the

182
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:27,423
writing style and the lore, some marketing, some game design

183
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,808
stuff. All of these things were really like big sort of home

184
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:33,833
runs I think for our creative direction. Excuse me.

185
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,357
When we first started, pixel art was hot,

186
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:41,598
and it was only getting hotter,

187
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,099
and you could get a lot of attention

188
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:46,460
by virtue of simply being a pixel art game.

189
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,861
And I think there's a case to be made

190
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:50,882
for the irony of cute pixel characters

191
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,364
suffering horrible depression and syphilis in a dungeon.

192
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,505
Like, that's kind of funny, right?

193
00:09:55,505 --> 00:09:57,926
There's something there.

194
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:01,557
It, ultimately we looked at it,

195
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,778
but it communicated the wrong things.

196
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:06,140
It led out with this idea of retro and charming.

197
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,522
And even though we were sort of a retro inspired

198
00:10:08,522 --> 00:10:11,765
kind of RPG, we couldn't lead out with that

199
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,586
rose colored nostalgia and cuteness.

200
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,468
It actually, it flew in the face

201
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:18,710
of what we were trying to accomplish.

202
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,532
We needed something like really awful and depressing

203
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:25,375
to really just hammer that horrible stuff home.

204
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:29,226
So heavy blacks came into play.

205
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:31,408
We started looking at a lot of comic books

206
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:33,690
and how to deliver on that vibe.

207
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,333
And the looseness of the art really reinforced

208
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,314
this idea of imperfection.

209
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:39,616
Your heroes are imperfect.

210
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:42,198
The information you're getting for your decision-making

211
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,039
is imperfect.

212
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,201
Imperfection is a huge theme in our game.

213
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:48,344
and it was great to give that like a visual personification

214
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,665
so that it's literally there.

215
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:51,186
Even if you're not consciously aware of it

216
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:53,568
when you're playing, it's one of those things

217
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:55,410
that it creeps up on you and you understand it

218
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,772
without necessarily knowing it consciously.

219
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,853
So I think that was a good choice.

220
00:10:59,853 --> 00:11:04,958
And the big win for me is that if I can be loose and sloppy

221
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,619
and people still think it's cool,

222
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:10,602
then I can get more done faster, which is great.

223
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:11,663
Because there's only one of me.

224
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:17,800
The other sort of assumption when you go in to make like an

225
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,723
RPG especially a turn based one is that the top down ISO Diablo

226
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,446
or classic Final Fantasy grid cam is usually the default

227
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,867
assumption when you describe a game like this to someone. But

228
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:31,529
we ended up with this weird side scrolling thing. You're always

229
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,132
moving left to right. And the reason was because as you can

230
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,954
see we did some exploration. Even after sort of getting some

231
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:40,655
real solid wins on the art style you can see it's starting to

232
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:41,956
creep in over there.

233
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:45,698
we tried to make it work with this sort of,

234
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:48,318
operating under the assumption that we had to do this.

235
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:49,439
But the more we got into it,

236
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,020
we realized that the wide angles

237
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,721
and the sort of godlike overview

238
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:56,981
robbed the game of that claustrophobic tension

239
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:58,562
that we felt like was so important.

240
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:00,903
We wanted you down in the dungeon with your characters.

241
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:03,103
We don't want you standing up above like,

242
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:05,404
you know, the Lord, kind of looking down

243
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:07,525
with this wide panoramic view.

244
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:11,146
It lost its sense of intimacy and a lot of the intensity.

245
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:14,987
And also, our game is about the psychological ramifications

246
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,967
of adventuring, and that's the characters.

247
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,308
It's not the environment.

248
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,048
So it's less about dungeon layout

249
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,989
and more about who's in the dungeon.

250
00:12:21,989 --> 00:12:23,949
So again, that was an argument to be made

251
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:26,650
for getting nice, close in on those characters.

252
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,970
And it's also really hard to relate

253
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,870
to the top of someone's head.

254
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,291
So, you know, having nice side view characters

255
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,811
gives you something that's a little bit more interesting

256
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,492
to look at, and you can kind of attach yourself

257
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,732
to the look and feel of the character.

258
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:38,311
And again, another big win is that it's the same set

259
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,615
of assets as combat.

260
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:44,040
So we didn't have to JRPG to a battle cam and, again,

261
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,223
imply bigger spaces.

262
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,806
And as a result, the game feels very,

263
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:51,291
you're very wrapped up in it as you're playing it.

264
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:58,119
The writing, a big assumption I think too

265
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,300
that we sort of wrestled with is that

266
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,801
when you make an RPG, usually there's gotta be

267
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,882
dwarves and elves that thought 10,000 years ago

268
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,003
and then there's a chosen one thrown in there at some point.

269
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,484
Maybe there's a life tree, I don't know.

270
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:10,305
Collect a few elements.

271
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:13,747
But it's always very exhaustively spelled out

272
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:16,288
and quite frankly, it kinda bores me to tears sometimes

273
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,809
and I kinda skip through a lot of the quests.

274
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,910
I'm like, do you want the wolf pelts?

275
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,771
Yes or no?

276
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:24,292
I just wanna get another sword, man.

277
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,229
So we felt like for our game though, um...

278
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,572
imperfect information. We don't want to spell out the story. We

279
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:37,113
want to suggest it's there and create this fog around the

280
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:41,653
player to deliver on this twilight zone uncertainty that I

281
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,654
think is really important and it features in a lot of love craft

282
00:13:44,654 --> 00:13:47,515
stuff. You only get a keyhole glimpse into these awful

283
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:50,875
horrors and if they were to be described exactly it does them a

284
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:56,056
disservice. So we went a different direction. We tried to

285
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:56,616
tell the story.

286
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,452
as much in the panels as in the gutters.

287
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:01,634
Like, I'm sure a lot of you guys read comics,

288
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,174
and your brain interpolates what's

289
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:05,555
happening between the panels in the white space in between.

290
00:14:05,555 --> 00:14:09,837
And so that gives you a point of contact

291
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:12,719
as the consumer of the product to get invested,

292
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,520
to use your own imagination to fill in those gaps.

293
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,581
And we felt like that would be, it

294
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,882
would pair nicely with the comic book style art,

295
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:23,164
and it would allow people to sort of integrate themselves

296
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:23,884
into the fiction.

297
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,828
And it means that we don't have to write a novel, which

298
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:27,508
is a huge win.

299
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:31,830
The writing style was a big risk for us as well,

300
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,392
because the game uses a lot of really antiquated verbiage,

301
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,992
if you will.

302
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:41,714
And it was really a way of us honoring the source material.

303
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,754
We felt like we couldn't decouple

304
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:48,736
the Lovecraftian overwrought tonality from the actual.

305
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:53,138
thematic influences. I felt like they were really enmeshed.

306
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:56,440
And so to try and tell a Lovecraft style story without

307
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,802
that terminology, that phrasing, that turn of phrase, would rob

308
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:04,644
it of something inherently that it needed. But it was a risk as

309
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:08,906
far as localization goes. And we were worried that people just

310
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:12,288
wouldn't like it or wouldn't get it. But that was a risk we were

311
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,409
willing to take because we felt like it honored the creative

312
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:15,830
direction of the game much more.

313
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:20,411
And again, yeah, horror thrives in the absence of certainty.

314
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:22,454
So the dark places of your imagination,

315
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,557
that's where kind of fear and concern settle in.

316
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,981
And anytime you can pay that out in a horror game,

317
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,843
I think you're doing well.

318
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:34,529
So we've looked at a few of these soft science areas

319
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,171
where the creative direction was important.

320
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,291
That's kind of low-hanging fruit,

321
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,193
because I think when people talk about creative direction,

322
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,954
they immediately associate it with art

323
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:42,655
and that kind of thing.

324
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,497
But we used it actually as a razor

325
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:47,339
when it came to features as well.

326
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,002
We really tried to ask the game essentially what it wanted,

327
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:54,384
what it needed to be able to pay off its identity.

328
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:58,866
So for instance, a gear system is a popular thing

329
00:15:58,866 --> 00:15:59,526
to have in an RPG.

330
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,447
It's usually what drives the player experience.

331
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,928
They want to upgrade their stuff and get new loot.

332
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:07,909
But it's extremely, extremely costly.

333
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:11,771
And we have a small team, obviously, and limited resources.

334
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,051
And we had to really ask ourselves,

335
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:15,052
is this something, is this a road we want to go down?

336
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:17,933
Does this actually serve the creative direction of the game?

337
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,174
And the answer was no.

338
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:21,675
Our game is about the sword arm, not the sword.

339
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:25,528
It's about the person who's wearing the armor,

340
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,849
not a number of upgrade gems on the armor.

341
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:28,670
Those games are great.

342
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,691
I love those games.

343
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,292
But that's not this game.

344
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,774
And I think understanding what game we were making

345
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:35,716
really helped us make these decisions

346
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:37,958
and really never look back.

347
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,359
So we used it as a razor to measure

348
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,921
the relative value and importance of many, many features.

349
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:44,203
You'll notice there's no crafting system.

350
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:49,084
we reduced it down to like two inventory slots,

351
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,345
but then we blew out the number of items that were there

352
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,627
because we recognized the value

353
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:54,648
in having collectible loot.

354
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,730
It's great, it's part and parcel of the experience,

355
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,692
but it shouldn't play lead guitar in this game.

356
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,533
It's the bass or even just the little dude

357
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,135
with the shaker in the back, you know?

358
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,242
It applies to marketing too. Trailers, when we were first

359
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:13,805
getting started I did a lot of research into sort of how game

360
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:16,386
trailers should be constructed and the conventional wisdom was

361
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,768
that they need to be fast, punchy, there needs to be flying

362
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:22,350
text. I think you're supposed to announce a new game mechanic

363
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,593
every five seconds. It's all, you can find it on Google. We

364
00:17:26,593 --> 00:17:30,935
didn't do any of that. Just because it didn't align with the

365
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:33,397
mood and tone of the game. So our trailers are...

366
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,198
are too long, they're too slow,

367
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:37,799
and they deliver feeling over function.

368
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,900
But ultimately, they were really successful

369
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,321
precisely for those reasons.

370
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:44,802
They stood out from a lot of other marketing materials

371
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:47,444
because of their commitment to the game's identity.

372
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,365
They felt like they were an extension of the game

373
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,305
as opposed to something that was slapped together

374
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,346
after the fact.

375
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,387
And I think that's really important

376
00:17:53,387 --> 00:17:55,788
because what's a marketing material but like an on-ramp,

377
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,089
right, you're trying to pull people in,

378
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:00,310
and if you're pulling them in in a slapdash way

379
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,591
that doesn't feel genuinely connected to the product itself,

380
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:07,012
I think you're on ramping them on to a gravel road somewhere.

381
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:13,914
So the last example I want to bring up is related to game

382
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:18,955
design. Generally this is a sound principle. Don't just

383
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:21,636
take away shit from people who worked really hard in your game

384
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:26,377
to earn it. That's kind of a no brainer. You can kind of see

385
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:32,518
what we did here. Oh, yeah. Come on to your maker.

386
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:40,018
What? Oh, my God, I have to choose a hero.

387
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:40,278
No. Oh, no way.

388
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:44,781
Oh, it's the cauldron all over again.

389
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:47,202
No wonder you bring that up.

390
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:52,365
Oh, wow. Yes.

391
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,266
Shit. Oh, man, we've got the whole boy.

392
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:59,008
I don't know who to pick.

393
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:02,310
I feel like we need our healer for the rest of this, but.

394
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,042
Alright, well, we're getting a spare of the others I am ready from our lepers, so I guess

395
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,764
we're gonna send him in.

396
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:18,765
God damn, that's cold, dude.

397
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:19,346
Son of a bitch.

398
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:20,926
Oh my god, come on.

399
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:26,910
You just, you go through all this and then you just have to give him up.

400
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,959
So that was the final boss for the game.

401
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:40,561
We violated pretty much every UI, UX rule and game design

402
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,743
rule with that fight precisely to pay off

403
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,544
cosmic horror, incomprehensible cosmic horror,

404
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,845
and the futility of trying to swing a two-handed sword

405
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,066
at the heart of the world.

406
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,567
You can't beat this, right?

407
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,308
How can you beat a Lovecraftian monster?

408
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:55,369
It's absurd.

409
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:59,451
So the final boss fight is like a thematic compression

410
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:00,671
of the entire play experience.

411
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,732
There's all the mechanics feature into that fight.

412
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:03,753
It's the entire mission.

413
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:07,074
And death and loss are an important part of our game.

414
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,734
And so we have to kill you in this fight.

415
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:11,195
Even if you're the best player in the world,

416
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:13,735
you must die in this fight.

417
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:15,936
But the first time you play it,

418
00:20:15,936 --> 00:20:17,536
you don't understand what's happening.

419
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,737
We broke the move flow, and you can see,

420
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:22,198
this is from a streamer called Bitterbit.

421
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:25,098
You can see he pauses, he's like, I don't understand.

422
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,319
Because the game completely stops doing

423
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,439
what they're used to seeing it do.

424
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,160
And we did that specifically to create

425
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,780
this sense of like, dawning horror.

426
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,401
It's uncertain.

427
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,222
What's going on?

428
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:37,824
Suddenly now the player is in the position of the heroes

429
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:38,765
who are in the game.

430
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:42,889
I mean, it's not as bad for the guy in his computer, right?

431
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,650
But it aligns their expectations,

432
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,032
and suddenly the play field is wide open,

433
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:48,353
and you're just wracked with uncertainty.

434
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:49,994
How many more times is he gonna do this?

435
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,215
Is this a death race?

436
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:52,096
Am I on a timer?

437
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,438
All of these questions kind of swim around,

438
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:56,260
and it elevates the intensity of the fight,

439
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,381
especially in the final minutes.

440
00:20:58,381 --> 00:20:59,022
Truth be told.

441
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:02,507
We built it so you could beat this end fight.

442
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:05,608
We want you to go through this experience,

443
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:08,810
but we want you to go through it off balance and unsure.

444
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,451
And because that's really what our game has been about.

445
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:14,112
And we wanted to make that final encounter everything

446
00:21:14,112 --> 00:21:15,032
that we'd been building up to.

447
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:18,734
So those are some examples of how

448
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:22,135
we use creative direction practically

449
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:24,116
throughout the project.

450
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,555
What we do is not easy.

451
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:28,495
I mean, you guys know this.

452
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,775
There's the hours, there's the pressure,

453
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:34,076
the desire to do great work as creative people,

454
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,717
not to mention the crushing self-doubt

455
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:38,718
and financial insecurity,

456
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:40,038
and all the other sort of horrors

457
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:42,439
that lurk around in the dark.

458
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:45,920
But having the confidence that comes from investing early

459
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,340
in a strong creative direction for our game

460
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,441
and understanding it, articulating it,

461
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,662
and referencing it in every discussion

462
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:53,602
that we possibly could.

463
00:21:55,222 --> 00:22:02,250
It gave us a lot of confidence and made our journey a lot easier, I think, than it could have been otherwise.

464
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,664
So we got to know our game.

465
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:09,465
We externalized its creative core.

466
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:12,707
We invited it to the meetings.

467
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,269
We leveraged its creative vision to vet features,

468
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,809
to inform decision making.

469
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:19,291
And the result was, thankfully, a high degree

470
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,812
of creative consistency.

471
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:24,714
Thematics meshed with art, meshed with sound and audio.

472
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:26,775
And Stuart Chatwood and Wayne June and Power Up Audio

473
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,996
did a fantastic job on the audio stuff.

474
00:22:30,877 --> 00:22:33,880
everything is in there for a reason. Everything has a

475
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,723
purpose in our game and it can be clearly pointed to. I think

476
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,725
that's really important as an indie game. You can't do

477
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,068
everything but what you do do you have to do it really, really

478
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:47,493
well to stand out. So... Thanks. I asked him to do like a

479
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:52,898
Brazilian macaw thing to let me know when I was running out of

480
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:54,739
time. It was good. It was good. Yeah.

481
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:59,173
So we spent a long time in early access. We were faced with an

482
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:03,016
onslaught of fantastic but often times diametrically opposed

483
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:07,880
feedback. We had our own ideas. We had deadlines. So for a while

484
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,402
there we were mired in the darkest dungeon of development.

485
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,904
But we used our creative direction to illuminate our

486
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:16,946
decision space a little bit and keep our party focused on what

487
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:22,130
was important and ultimately we got out intact. Having said

488
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,332
that, I still need a few nights at the tavern. Anyway.

489
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,640
That's my talk. Thank you very much.

490
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:41,268
I think I timed it okay. I think we have a few minutes for Q&A

491
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:49,972
if anybody wants to say anything. I have a question.

492
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:55,941
Yeah, okay, so when you're making a game you sometimes have to pivot your design because you realize it didn't work as well

493
00:23:55,941 --> 00:24:00,387
You did when you separate yourself from your creative direction as its own thing

494
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:02,991
Is it still able to pivot or you like this is where we have to build now?

495
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:05,885
I think you want to get to the point where you feel confident

496
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:09,127
in it before you jump into development so you save

497
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:10,168
yourself a pivot later.

498
00:24:10,168 --> 00:24:12,349
Obviously, practically sometimes you've got to make

499
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:13,629
adjustments and changes.

500
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:16,391
But I think that when you're talking about creative

501
00:24:16,391 --> 00:24:18,552
direction, it can be implemented a number of

502
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:19,553
different ways.

503
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:22,154
And usually when you pivot, you're pivoting on specific

504
00:24:22,154 --> 00:24:25,135
features or the way it's expressed.

505
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:28,037
So I think you can make strides on articulating a

506
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:30,098
creative direction and still make adjustments to your

507
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:30,798
implementation.

508
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:32,079
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

509
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:35,852
Thanks.

510
00:24:35,852 --> 00:24:36,212
Thanks.

511
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:42,034
With regards to the kind of metagame in Darkest Dungeon with the characters being disposable,

512
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:47,456
was that something that was intentionally designed with the same theme of horror and

513
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:49,677
uncertainty and all that kind of stuff?

514
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:52,298
Yeah, of course, because we kind of wanted to subvert this idea

515
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:54,379
that when you start an RPG, like, they're all little

516
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:57,760
precious snowflakes that you're going to carry through to the

517
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,301
end. And pay off that sort of pulp horror view of humanity as

518
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,021
being inconsequential. So we layer that in right from the

519
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,342
beginning, although you don't actually know that's what we're

520
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:09,942
doing until it's kind of too late and you're getting heart

521
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:16,324
attacked just relentlessly. So the disposability of human life

522
00:25:16,324 --> 00:25:19,745
is part and parcel of the whole cosmic horror thing.

523
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,607
and it's also just sort of a really neat exploration

524
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,028
in terms of how people play the game.

525
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:26,089
They start out very attached

526
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,390
and then they start to lose their heroes

527
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,191
and then they get resentful at the game

528
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:32,273
so they say, well fine, I'm not gonna name anybody.

529
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:34,034
And then they start making way more money

530
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,676
and then they realize they're the villain.

531
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:39,237
And we didn't do that, it's on you.

532
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,378
Thanks.

533
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:48,731
Hi. I was wondering, you had mentioned you had that fear of

534
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:53,196
the financial issues and stuff. So I was wondering exactly how

535
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:58,683
did you guys choose where to allocate funds for when you were

536
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,424
in development?

537
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:06,380
Well, you know, the first part of our project was all bootstrapped, so we each had our own sort of like personal runways

538
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:11,327
that we used up, you know, for a while. And Kickstarter was a huge, huge help to us.

539
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:16,414
But really it just went towards cost of living and just keeping us fed and keeping the lights on.

540
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:19,868
Where we broke down our man hours, or our focus,

541
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:24,570
was driven a lot by what we felt were the most salient

542
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,070
and important things.

543
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,811
Sometimes it's not, like you can't always work on your

544
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:30,752
top line feature, the other stuff has to get attention too.

545
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:34,313
But certainly the early access release that we brought

546
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:37,894
to market a year ago was sort of our best effort

547
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:40,595
in making sure that we put our time and energy

548
00:26:40,595 --> 00:26:41,835
on the things that were most important.

549
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,176
And then throughout the year we were able to circle back

550
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:45,616
and kind of like raise the quality level

551
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:46,317
and everything else.

552
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:47,467
Thank you.

553
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:52,049
I was just curious how much of the game's mechanics had you

554
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,991
prototype before you felt like your direction was totally

555
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:55,171
solid?

556
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:58,293
It's a bit weird and I can't say this is going to be entirely

557
00:26:58,293 --> 00:27:01,835
transferable but Tyler and I would sit down and we talked

558
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:05,577
through and storyboarded most of the game prior to even starting

559
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:05,958
development.

560
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,818
It was just the two of us.

561
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:09,660
So when we started, I'm not saying we had every problem

562
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,061
solved but we certainly had a lot of the

563
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:17,079
the vision and the core idea of how the game would play out and

564
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,442
what the mechanics looked like. Obviously there were changes and

565
00:27:20,442 --> 00:27:26,067
nuances. We added corpses. That was really fun. So things

566
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:32,132
evolved over time as they should. But, yeah, it's we knew a

567
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:37,077
lot before we started. Sorry, I think he was up.

568
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,024
So most games focus on giving power to the players and make

569
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:43,526
them have a lot of fun and feel good about playing the game.

570
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:47,168
Were you prepared for making a game where you were pretty much

571
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:50,291
doing the opposite and maybe making people really upset?

572
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:55,094
Like, just out of curiosity.

573
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:55,995
Yes.

574
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:56,255
Okay.

575
00:27:56,255 --> 00:28:03,720
We knew that we were sort of like walking a bit of a tight

576
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,201
rope.

577
00:28:05,072 --> 00:28:08,036
To be totally honest with you guys, and I guess the internet

578
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:10,319
because it's going to be recorded,

579
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,384
we maybe weren't prepared for some of the vitriolic responses

580
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:18,509
once you've experienced the party wipe and the level of like.

581
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:26,446
lemon juice that goes along with some of those comments.

582
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:29,747
But we always felt like we managed to straddle the line

583
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:32,168
and make sure that you were empowered enough to make

584
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,208
progress, but that your progress was never guaranteed.

585
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:39,350
And so I grew to sort of disregard feedback that said,

586
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,771
you know, I have my level two guys with level two armor

587
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:42,991
fighting a level two monster.

588
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:43,951
I should win.

589
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,632
Fundamentally, you should not in our game.

590
00:28:45,632 --> 00:28:48,353
That's not a promise that we ever made you.

591
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,073
That's just your condition for it, right?

592
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:53,482
But yeah, I think that in some ways

593
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,587
we weren't necessarily prepared for some

594
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:58,052
of the more colorful responses to that.

595
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:01,941
Thank you for being so uncompromising.

596
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:27,070
So obviously you highlighted the importance of creative direction when it comes to unifying all of the game elements such as art, design, narrative and so on in order to create a cohesive whole because otherwise if you had one element that kind of stood out of the pack and was an outlier then obviously it would have been all the more noticeable and that would have kind of thrown the player off.

597
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:33,779
Regarding, you know, maintaining that creative direction,

598
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:37,482
can you name me, like, any particular roadblocks

599
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:41,766
and disagreements you and your teammates had

600
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,768
during the development of Darkest Dungeon?

601
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:47,514
The irony of making games is that you don't often times get a

602
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:51,296
lot of time to play them. But I can say that like Crypt of the

603
00:29:51,296 --> 00:29:54,017
Necrodancer, for instance, I felt like really had the same

604
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:56,638
sort of tight vision, the way the dungeon floor turns into a

605
00:29:56,638 --> 00:30:00,340
disco and, you know, little nods like that just to keep looping

606
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,802
it back around and the beating heart, it was a great, yeah,

607
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:08,404
they wove like sort of this dark fantasy story around this like

608
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:10,565
crazy dance game. And I thought they did that really, really

609
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:12,566
masterfully. So that was a standout for me as well.

610
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:20,034
interesting. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time.
