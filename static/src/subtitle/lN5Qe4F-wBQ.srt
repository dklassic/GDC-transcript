1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,901
Well, so welcome.

2
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:07,642
I'm Matt Baum.

3
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,423
Welcome to Playing With Pride.

4
00:00:10,704 --> 00:00:14,007
So this is a several years long project

5
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:16,929
to answer the question of what happens

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:19,811
when queer culture and game culture collide,

7
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,713
and particularly what that collision means

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,854
for game developers.

9
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:26,156
For the last three years, I've been gathering video interviews

10
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:28,738
with LGBT gamers, along with my partner James.

11
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,441
And we're going to share some stories

12
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,622
that we've collected today.

13
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:34,874
So, just a quick introduction about me.

14
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:38,035
I'm a writer and multimedia producer in Seattle.

15
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:42,918
I cover LGBT issues for Rolling Stone and Vice Magazine and Slate and a whole bunch

16
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:43,318
of others.

17
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:47,720
I have a podcast called The Sewers of Paris where I interview queer people about entertainment

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,601
that's changed their lives.

19
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:54,004
And along with James, my partner, we do a live show and podcast called Queens of Adventure

20
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,965
featuring drag queens playing Dungeons and Dragons.

21
00:00:58,146 --> 00:01:01,688
So the intersection of queer and game is a big part of our lives.

22
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:08,654
So a couple of years ago, we noticed that there was this rising interest in gaming events geared towards LGBT people,

23
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:12,837
and we were curious about that. What do games have to do with sexuality?

24
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:17,322
This is a question that a lot of people were asking, not always in good faith.

25
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:23,107
So we wanted to answer that, particularly when it comes to the games industry.

26
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:26,690
James is a long-time game designer.

27
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,044
I worked at Capcom and LeapFrog and LucasArts and we noticed that there might be a need for

28
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:38,828
games culture and queer culture to overlap in a way that wasn't currently being met.

29
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:45,794
So we decided to ask people about that. We recorded interviews with over 100 people in their homes,

30
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:50,698
occasionally at work, asking them how games have helped them to come out, fall in love,

31
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:54,401
explore their sexuality, feel less alone. We also talked to developers about how they've

32
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:56,102
incorporated queer themes into their work.

33
00:01:57,044 --> 00:01:59,045
A lot of the people that we spoke to were queer,

34
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,165
some were straight, some were trans, some were non-binary.

35
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:03,926
We heard a lot of deeply personal stories

36
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:06,287
about navigating between those queer worlds

37
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:08,407
and gamer worlds, particularly when it comes

38
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:10,268
to love, romance, and dating.

39
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:14,529
We also heard from gamers about needs and wants

40
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,170
that the industry isn't currently meeting.

41
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,550
And we talked to game developers about what they're doing

42
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,071
to meet those needs, what they're changing on their end

43
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:22,492
and changing about their practices.

44
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:27,129
So what we're going to look at today, what I'm sharing with you, is some short video clips from those conversations,

45
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,290
highlighting some themes that came up again and again and again.

46
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,310
A couple of quick notes.

47
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:37,832
These are the stories from people that we talked to. It's not the complete queer gamer experience.

48
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:42,994
There are a lot of topics that we touched on in these interviews that we just are not going to have time to talk about today.

49
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:47,035
And also, some of the folks that we talked to spoke about their experience being harassed.

50
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:50,497
They used some slurs to talk about what they experienced.

51
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,239
just to prepare you in case that's something that you don't want to hear.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,443
So something that we heard from almost everybody is that when

53
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:03,066
the people we spoke to were young, gaming was considered safe. It was fun.

54
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:05,308
It was something that brought people together.

55
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:08,691
And then for a lot of people that changed when they wanted to share their

56
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,332
love of games with queer friends,

57
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:13,875
or when they wanted to talk about sexuality or sexual orientation or gender

58
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:15,396
identity with gaming friends.

59
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:17,818
And these two worlds just seemed incompatible.

60
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,520
You know, I thought I was...

61
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:26,447
an outcast, there was some kind of freak, because I didn't know any gay people and there was nothing on the telly.

62
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:29,228
So it was like, what's wrong with me?

63
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:34,530
When I was a kid, all my friends were like the nerdy boys.

64
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,572
And the very fact that I was also into the same nerdy stuff that they were into

65
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:42,833
made them assume that I wasn't gay.

66
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:47,735
And if you talked about gay stuff, it was not okay.

67
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:54,897
I'm sitting there like I have all these likes and loves and it's like I didn't really have a place to really express and even in like the anime groups and whatnot, it was kind of like,

68
00:03:56,478 --> 00:04:02,522
you don't like it the way I like it. You guys are staring at like all the big, all the girls with big boobs in the anime and I'm just like, who's that hottie guy over there?

69
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,884
I mean, before I was even attracted to anyone, I was being called faggot.

70
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:16,290
I just knew that it was bad. And it was something that I should feel guilty about and I tried to not be. So I guess I kind of closed myself off from my parents.

71
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:20,797
and closed myself off from my peers.

72
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,578
So it made me, you know, my parents copped and commented

73
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:24,219
that I was a hermit,

74
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:25,819
because I would just be up in my room all the time

75
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,080
playing my video games.

76
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,261
But that was, that was the way I coped,

77
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,182
although I didn't think of it as coping at the time.

78
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:36,043
My friend had completely abandoned role-playing games.

79
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,445
He no longer wanted anything to do with me.

80
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:45,166
And so I was completely, completely baffled.

81
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:49,952
And I would be asking, so what happened between you and your friend?

82
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,793
And I don't know.

83
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:54,795
He just doesn't want to talk with me.

84
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:58,398
Because, like, you kind of feel like an outsider in both worlds,

85
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:02,641
because it's like, oh, well, I'm not straight,

86
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:06,804
but like, I'm not completely gay, so like I'm not gay enough.

87
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:10,226
I have this like gaming aspect of my life.

88
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:12,048
And in a way, I like I have the queer.

89
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,352
you know, aspect of my life and like, you know, never the twain shall meet sort of thing.

90
00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:23,476
I can either be black, I could be gay, or I could be a nerd.

91
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:30,120
And I did for a really long time feel like that I kind of had to like hide parts of myself.

92
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:36,344
Games kind of started being a lot more about like bang bang and like macho chess beating

93
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:42,027
and for like reasons that I can look back at now and understand, right, but at the time

94
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:42,468
I couldn't.

95
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:46,251
I started just kind of being like, well, maybe I'm just not into games.

96
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:52,216
You know, like, we have PAX East here in Boston that when you go, you sometimes are concerned

97
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:56,639
about, you know, being out and, you know, sometimes some people are being very immature,

98
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,760
some people being homophobic.

99
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:03,864
Other times if you just go, you know, to do other events, like, for example, going to

100
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:09,489
Gay Pride, folks are mainly more focused on kind of either kind of the more body conscious

101
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:12,031
aspects of pride, looking good, or...

102
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:18,037
Um, you know, or we don't necessarily get to really talk about people's interests beyond just being gay.

103
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,499
Yeah, the two never overlapped.

104
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,783
In the gay community, there's just other things going on, and so they don't necessarily...

105
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,165
Not always the best time to pull out a board game and be like,

106
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:31,167
Hey, guys, want to play Risk?

107
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,489
My biggest gamer friends were all straight men.

108
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:39,673
Which, I mean, not a bad thing. Straight men are people too, and we should give them all the love they deserve.

109
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,374
But, like, there was definitely, like...

110
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,748
we could only talk about video games,

111
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:46,029
like, talk about relationship stuff with little, like,

112
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,993
uh, you're into girls, I'm into dudes, like, mm.

113
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,114
I think I still feel like that

114
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:56,257
Tara Brantford character from Final Fantasy,

115
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:58,038
where that, I don't feel like,

116
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:01,420
when I'm at a gay bar, that I fit in there,

117
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,562
because everybody's excited about

118
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:08,185
a Britney Spears video being on the monitor,

119
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,586
and I don't really care about that.

120
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:13,294
And if I talk about a game that had just come out that I'm excited about,

121
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:15,355
they don't care about that.

122
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,357
So I never really feel like I fit in anywhere.

123
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,159
Meow!

124
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,380
That's why I have animal friends.

125
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:34,005
So we, by the way, we could do like a super cut of all the times that interviews have been interrupted by cats in this project.

126
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:36,566
Turns out that queer people have a lot of cats.

127
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:42,897
So the feeling that a lot of those people talked about there, of being unwelcome, closed

128
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:45,499
a lot of LGBTQ people that we spoke to.

129
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:48,061
It just closed them off to games in general.

130
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,124
It made them feel as though gaming simply wasn't for them.

131
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:53,646
That was even my, like personally, that was my own experience.

132
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:59,650
For most of my 20s and the 2000s, I just didn't see queer people in games, and I felt like

133
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:03,934
I was intruding whenever I talked to what I thought of as real gamers.

134
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:08,514
And, you know, something that we heard from a lot of these folks that it would alienate

135
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,934
queer people to talk about games.

136
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,935
And those feelings extended into dating as well.

137
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:18,256
We heard from a lot of the folks that we visited who felt as though they couldn't bring up

138
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:21,497
games on dates for fear of alienating a potential partner.

139
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:26,018
Gaming was seen as a liability, a source of embarrassment, like you're not a real queer

140
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:27,538
if you play games, you're not a real gamer if you're queer.

141
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,879
And then worse, that didn't stop with rejection.

142
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,340
It also included harassment from other gamers.

143
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:38,460
Because sometimes with gamers, it's a little, they don't really care for drag queens.

144
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:42,924
When I started playing World of Warcraft, I was in a raiding guild, right?

145
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:50,209
Like I was in a serious, hardcore, 40-man, three days a week, spending time raiding guild, right?

146
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,233
And I left them because they kept using the word faggot in guild chat.

147
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:57,755
And I was like, you know, I'm done.

148
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:00,838
I was in a guild on my son's server and...

149
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,183
That was, anytime we didn't win, it was, that's okay, or you dumb faggot.

150
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:08,485
And I was just done.

151
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:11,268
I played World of Warcraft for a short period of time.

152
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,190
This was a long time before my transition.

153
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,674
So, identifying as female at the time,

154
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:20,136
there's plenty of bullying when it comes to female gamers.

155
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,558
At the time, I couldn't even fight that.

156
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:23,639
I just stopped playing.

157
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,261
I think I only played World of Warcraft for

158
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,303
maybe a week before I just completely stopped.

159
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:33,734
We also heard a lot of first-hand accounts from people working in the game industry.

160
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:38,875
A common thread was a perception that their input wasn't valued, or that bringing up LGBT

161
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,035
topics relating to games could negatively impact their career.

162
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:46,596
And so this next video features all people who work in games, and we asked them if they

163
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:50,157
perceived obstacles to just doing their work, and here's what they said.

164
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:57,038
If you go to GDC, or you go to any convention that is gaming or tech-focused, you don't

165
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:57,838
see people like you.

166
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:58,998
It can be very discouraging.

167
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,487
Growing up, video games were always for children.

168
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:10,048
And homosexuality was not proper to be exposed to children.

169
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:19,830
I just never, I just, even being in the industry, I just assumed that those were two things that were never going to be, come into connection to each other.

170
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,491
You know, I thought, alright, well the queer world is pride parades and all the bars and clubs and that sort of thing.

171
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:28,352
And then there's the game world where I have to be...

172
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:31,290
super serious, you know, get ready, let's make this shit.

173
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,551
I didn't realize there was any overlap.

174
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,911
So I worked at Electronic Arts,

175
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:36,992
global rookie of the year,

176
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,933
and I designed a game called Madden Football.

177
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:41,774
So there was,

178
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:45,296
and before that I had been like a sports reporter in school

179
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,897
and there was no intersection of gay life

180
00:10:47,997 --> 00:10:51,298
and sports, professional sports life in that time,

181
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:52,518
like in the early 90s.

182
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:54,939
There was no, there just wasn't a thing.

183
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,080
Like I wouldn't bring any personal

184
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:02,405
to it. I just would just shut that down if anything got super close to personal or what

185
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:07,148
are you doing this weekend or whatever. I'm like sports. Going to PAX for the first time

186
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:15,352
really opened my eyes to this is the community where I feel most at home. But then after I

187
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:21,315
started, you know, participating in that community more, I also then started to see how I wasn't

188
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:27,919
fully at home there. That the media in that community wasn't being made.

189
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:36,720
for me? So we spoke to a lot of people about the problems that they've experienced as players or as

190
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:44,165
makers, and we also found a lot of optimism as well. So despite all those problems, a lot of

191
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:49,828
people spoke about how games could provide some measure of relief. Even though most games, even

192
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,630
to this day, aren't made with queer players specifically in mind,

193
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:58,026
Many of the folks that we interviewed either sought out titles that intentionally included queer people,

194
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,909
or they used their imagination to insert themselves into their favorite stories.

195
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,833
And in creating and playing as characters who reflected their interests,

196
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:11,978
queer gamers were able to find a place where those two sides of their personalities could both coexist.

197
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:18,724
And for a lot of these players, they spoke particularly intensely about the importance of character creators,

198
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:20,065
particularly about having a...

199
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:25,261
avatar that represents them in ways that they might not be ready to express in real life.

200
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:30,164
So that allowed, for example, transgender gamers to experiment with gender and sexuality

201
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:35,546
before expressing themselves, before basically affirming themselves in the real world.

202
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:40,789
There's a chance to really get into the story, get into why characters are doing things,

203
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:47,253
hopefully their motivations, and figure out kind of who I am along with these characters.

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,783
We feel like our characters in Final Fantasy really represent what we would be in a fantasy world.

205
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:59,186
They complement each other, because you're white magic, I'm black magic, you're healing and destruction.

206
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,608
Yeah, so I have to clean up his mess, wow.

207
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:10,212
Video games were actually kind of the first way that I kind of became comfortable with expressing other genders.

208
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:11,833
My first kind of...

209
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:19,660
gender change happened when I was someone had bought me a bootleg copy of Pokemon crystal for my birthday because it was bootleg

210
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:25,162
halfway through the game crashed and then when I rebooted my save I

211
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:29,883
Was a girl that was kind of an epiphany moment because I'm like, oh I

212
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,083
Like this more than I should

213
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,744
Peach is a big one growing up because back then she was just the princess

214
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:39,966
I was it kind of identified with her and I was just like picking the girl characters when I could

215
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:44,279
It's nice seeing yourself on the game screen and that's your avatar out there.

216
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,160
It's not actually you, but it's nice to kind of think it is you a little bit.

217
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,182
Seeing Samus and knowing that was a girl going into that, I'm like, this is really cool.

218
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:53,703
And she kicked ass.

219
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:56,384
I was actually really aware of what I was doing.

220
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:59,585
Like I'm picking her because I actually identify that way.

221
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,246
Favorite characters?

222
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,287
Um, probably Wheatley from Portal.

223
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:07,369
I tend to kind of lean toward characters that aren't really, uh,

224
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,823
specifically human because it's easier for me to relate to somebody who's not

225
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:21,649
specifically set into a certain gender. Like robots, they're robots. Wheatley has a male voice, but that doesn't mean he's technically male.

226
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:28,835
Myself being a female-to-male transgender, it's easier for me to kind of relate to characters like that.

227
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,717
Growing up, I had always chosen

228
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:36,500
my character's creation had always been male. Like it was just, oh, click!

229
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:44,377
I mean, it was really, they really were, character creators were like such a safe place where

230
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:50,220
I could just, gender could be whatever, like the character creator would allow me to make

231
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,280
it.

232
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:53,743
And I would always explore.

233
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:54,904
Oh, and small boobs.

234
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:55,864
Short hair.

235
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,246
Women, no boobs, short hair.

236
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:00,327
Big boobs.

237
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,248
I don't know.

238
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:03,890
I have a lot of favorite game characters.

239
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,890
One of them is totally cheating.

240
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,658
which is Fem Shep from Mass Effect.

241
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:10,361
That's cheating because a lot of what you make

242
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:11,922
that character is your choices.

243
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:16,386
You know, she starts as a relatively blank slate.

244
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,367
There's definitely some information filled in.

245
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,110
But she is very much what you make of her.

246
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,393
But she's so well done and she's so nuanced.

247
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:28,556
The writing and the presentation is so wonderfully done.

248
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,857
Easily one of my favorite characters.

249
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:33,100
Well I guess, you know, Shepard from Mass Effect.

250
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,781
He was a good character, he was the hero, and then just the fact on top of it that the

251
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:44,002
game allowed you to play a gay character.

252
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:48,624
So he could be the gay hero that I wanted to be.

253
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:57,147
I think I probably took a lot of my inspiration from myself when I was coming out, from characters

254
00:15:57,187 --> 00:16:00,588
like Bayonetta, who are stronger and sexy.

255
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:07,688
The first time I went out as a woman and as my true self, I was...

256
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:13,670
I think I remember shaking because I was just so nervous that people were going to be so mean to me.

257
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,572
I think that's why avatars are so important, especially for young trans kids,

258
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:23,834
because they can create that identity in the game and live as that identity,

259
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:27,615
especially if they're not ready to do it in their actual reality.

260
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,452
So many of the people that we spoke to gravitated towards games that allowed them to explore

261
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:40,514
objects of their affection and to role-play romance stories.

262
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:47,317
In contrast to real-life situations where talking about gaming might cause a date's

263
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:51,899
eyes to glaze over, which is something that a lot of people spoke about, a lot of the

264
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:56,961
gamers that we spoke to found games that let them safely explore sex and attraction and

265
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:57,542
relationships.

266
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,191
in ways that might not have been available to them,

267
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:03,213
or that they might not have been comfortable exploring

268
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:03,894
in real life.

269
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:07,877
And for those players, the games were about much more

270
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:08,897
than just having fun.

271
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:11,519
Those games were providing a safe haven

272
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,681
that folks might not otherwise have,

273
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,042
particularly for people who live outside of a major city,

274
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,565
or who live in a country that might be more conservative when

275
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,327
it comes to dating, and might pose safety hazards

276
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,808
to being openly queer.

277
00:17:26,165 --> 00:17:28,767
Or just to people who didn't have online support networks.

278
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:36,795
I definitely give in to the sort of like typical male power fantasy except queer.

279
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:42,280
So like with Dragon Age and Mass Effect I build sort of you know like it's like you

280
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,381
know build a boyfriend.

281
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,583
I think my Fallout character was pretty hot.

282
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,046
We like to make big muscle guys with beards and no hugs.

283
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,870
When we play Saints Row, we run around with our characters naked.

284
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,714
So it's all about the beards and the muscles, really.

285
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:03,058
And for me, it's inspiring because I do want to have that superhero body.

286
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:07,161
So I work hard to look like my characters.

287
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:11,545
I really love the Shepard, Kate, and Elenco romance option that was there,

288
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,307
but I wish y'all got to fuck more than once.

289
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,509
And I also wish Elenco had a beard.

290
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,611
And I want to see Shepard and Elenco.

291
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,390
on the rooftop looking at the stars in Vancouver, where he's from.

292
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,031
He is such a sweetie.

293
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,652
In Fable, you can flirt with male or female.

294
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,653
The storyline's amazing, too, but to have that option

295
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:35,774
until you actually have it and do it, you don't realize how much you missed

296
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:36,634
not having that.

297
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:41,116
I mentioned Fable because I think that was the first game I played

298
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,896
where you could actually play a gay character.

299
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,298
It was common. It was, you know, it was.

300
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,264
something I can identify with.

301
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,986
Like say, in Skyrim, you could totally marry a guy.

302
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:59,989
And, you know, being a gay man,

303
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:03,131
like if you had the choice to marry a girl or a guy,

304
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:04,512
of course you're gonna marry the guy.

305
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,094
You know, I'm playing Fallout 4 still, right now,

306
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:12,296
and right now I am in a relationship

307
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:14,337
with a feisty Irish lady.

308
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:24,577
rugged, roguish, ghoul man, a synthetic woman, and I'm currently working on impressing a certain

309
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:33,182
George Clooney-looking paladin. And that really is my idea of a perfect lifestyle.

310
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:39,286
That was a revelation because I was so, I guess, just shocked that something

311
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,468
that is part of my life was suddenly in this video game.

312
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,823
having a lot of fun with Irish rogues and ghouls and paladins and robot women.

313
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:54,386
So I think that that's the closest the video game's going to get to me, I think.

314
00:19:56,907 --> 00:20:00,389
So just as a kind of a measure of how much has changed in the last few years,

315
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:06,973
when we started this project probably about four, four years ago-ish, you know, when we would have

316
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:10,555
a conversation about queer characters and games, people would be like, oh, isn't this amazing that

317
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:12,336
it was right before Inquisition came out.

318
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:14,943
And people were like, oh, there's this game coming out

319
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,644
that's gonna have queer relationships.

320
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,085
Isn't that amazing?

321
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,647
And then just last night, I was having a conversation

322
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:23,549
with a developer about a dating sim involving monsters,

323
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:27,211
and I asked, are there going to be,

324
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,253
can you have relationships with characters of any gender?

325
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:32,594
And he gave me this look like, of course.

326
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,695
And he was like, yeah, of course, why wouldn't you?

327
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:37,517
So just to have that be the response,

328
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:38,658
instead of like, isn't this amazing?

329
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:39,678
We're doing this for the first time.

330
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,640
Just in the last few years, a lot has changed.

331
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:49,585
So as the people that we interviewed felt more comfortable expressing those two sides of their personality,

332
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:53,807
the queer side and the gamer aspect, something big changed in their life.

333
00:20:54,867 --> 00:21:04,091
Going from virtual relationships into real life, they found that this is something that affected their dating and romance and relationships in real life.

334
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:09,634
When they talked about games on dates, instead of being met with skepticism, they were met with enthusiasm.

335
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:12,055
And so games really changed how people were able to...

336
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,430
form bonds with other people.

337
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,351
I met my boyfriend through Baldur's Gate.

338
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:19,912
It's run this weird thread through my life.

339
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,594
She was in a friend's dorm room

340
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:26,095
fitting for her Padme costume from episode 2.

341
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,476
We met, we actually met online,

342
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,537
which we don't usually tell people.

343
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:32,258
Usually we say we met at a comic book shop

344
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:33,579
because there's still a lot of stigma

345
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,299
around people who meet online.

346
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,780
We met on Grindr.

347
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:39,761
Yeah, I mean, we...

348
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:44,567
didn't know we were like kind of geeks in that way at first.

349
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:48,570
Like over text, it was just like, what are you doing?

350
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,491
Oh, I'm, you know, playing some Final Fantasy.

351
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:51,932
Oh yeah, what's your favorite character?

352
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:55,954
And so we got into it that way and it was kind of cool.

353
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:59,297
Right now he's still underleveled so I'm helping him, you know,

354
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,538
gain his bearings and whatnot.

355
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:05,140
The guy I'm seeing now is very Canadian

356
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,203
and I met him at a board game convention a couple years ago.

357
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,951
So he's got, it's really funny, the first time we went to his house,

358
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:17,034
I flipped out because I saw an NES like right by his TV and I got really happy.

359
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:20,257
Like even if he doesn't play it, just knowing that it's there,

360
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,139
it tells me something about him, something that we already have in common.

361
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,763
I think finding somebody who was also a gamer was really important to me because

362
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:34,148
having that agreement and just being like, our space is not going to be conventional.

363
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,550
And people are going to look at us and they're going to scream, my God,

364
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,551
they're terrible nerds.

365
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:37,951
And

366
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:40,075
were going to laugh in their face about it.

367
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,235
And I needed that in my life.

368
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,036
We're both playing through Fire Emblem Fates right now.

369
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:47,977
So we're each playing that on our own.

370
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,097
And we're talking about like, oh,

371
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,657
who are we pairing together to make their kid

372
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,778
and like to have like the best stats and all that stuff.

373
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,979
Like he's made like a full on like Excel sheet

374
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,019
of like all the pairings that he's going to make

375
00:22:59,059 --> 00:22:59,419
for the game.

376
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,419
Like he's super into it.

377
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:02,440
Yeah, and I'm like, you're a nerd.

378
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,220
And I'm like, I love it.

379
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,820
Like you, are we getting married tomorrow?

380
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,301
Where's my ring?

381
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:14,910
So it's actually been a while since I showed that particular clip and I just realized like a nice little

382
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:20,994
Coda to that story is that DJ is now engaged to his boyfriend. So so he got his ring. Yay

383
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:28,039
And that was actually like an experience that I had as well I met my partner James 15 years ago

384
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,181
through Final Fantasy

385
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:36,025
it was in college and my suite had the nice TV and he had the PlayStation and so

386
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:40,156
We kind of combined forces and that was like how we got talking to each other

387
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,117
because we're both shy nerds and we wouldn't have been able to talk to each

388
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:45,719
other otherwise. And so you know it's just this common thing that like games

389
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,501
bring couples together in a way that really it's a recent development. It's

390
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:55,543
something that we've heard from people in just the last couple years that was

391
00:23:55,583 --> 00:24:00,666
much rarer maybe like a decade or two ago. And so that's not the only personal

392
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,527
change that people experienced through that blending of queer culture and game

393
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:05,788
culture. A lot of players experienced...

394
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:13,485
significant personal changes when they encountered queer content in games or queer characters or just games that lent themselves to queer headcanon

395
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:20,110
So I mean for me Mario Kart like I queer every character in Mario Kart and I have this like whole backstory about like Bowser

396
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,053
Competing with Donkey Kong. I mean, it's just my story

397
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:29,056
but you know, we hear the power of people kind of taking command of the

398
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:34,020
Of the content that they that is presented to them and saying okay. Thank you for making this Nintendo now

399
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,901
I'm gonna take it from here

400
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,766
So among those personal changes that people experience,

401
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,847
they're seeing that acknowledgment of their existence.

402
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:46,068
That invites queer players into games

403
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:48,229
where they might have felt unwelcome.

404
00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:52,531
It gives them an opportunity to identify as gamers,

405
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:54,891
where previously they would have been,

406
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,992
we heard this common thing, oh, it's just not for me.

407
00:24:57,652 --> 00:24:59,353
This is still something that I personally deal with.

408
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,954
I produce a show right now where I'm DMing a D&D game.

409
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:06,630
And just even a year ago, when I thought about Dungeons and Dragons, I was like,

410
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:13,895
oh, that's not for me. It turns out D&D is super queer.

411
00:25:13,975 --> 00:25:18,998
Also, like having games as a practice space to express that you are queer

412
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:23,221
can allow players to build confidence in other aspects of their lives.

413
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:27,023
So a lot of people that we talked to talked about how gameplay helped them

414
00:25:28,604 --> 00:25:32,587
assert themselves authentically, even after they stepped away from the screen.

415
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:36,326
Right after my sister passed away, I got a key for Gone Home.

416
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:42,488
And I went through Gone Home, and there was this moment of, I don't know, you could call it an

417
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:48,471
epiphany or an aha moment. I was reading one of the letters in the game, and the characters,

418
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:53,272
you know, was doing the voiceover, and I kind of had a little bit of disconnect because

419
00:25:54,273 --> 00:26:00,795
what the character was voicing about her sister, it really echoed some of the feelings and emotions.

420
00:26:01,535 --> 00:26:05,718
and just experiences that I had with my sister and her sexuality.

421
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:10,720
And I remember I even like blurted it out on stream, like, whoa,

422
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,581
like I'm in my feelings right now.

423
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:15,783
I might need to take a minute because this is really reminding me of the

424
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:17,304
relationship that I had with my sister.

425
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:22,147
I guess you could say revealed to me some of how she might've been feeling.

426
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:27,870
It, it put, it put me in her shoes in a way.

427
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,791
It was kind of like.

428
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:34,762
This might sound odd, but it was kind of a way for me to get closure, too.

429
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,544
Like, this is kind of reflecting me in my sister's life.

430
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,026
It really actually gave me some peace, honestly.

431
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:47,090
Gone Home as a game that was explicitly queer was extremely powerful.

432
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,974
It was a game that I didn't realize I'd been waiting for my whole life until I played it.

433
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:53,355
Why is this so rare?

434
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:59,018
Why is it so unusual that a narrative that centers, you know, queer women?

435
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,751
is practically unheard of.

436
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:05,134
Confirmation that you exist is an amazingly powerful thing.

437
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:12,699
I think at some fundamental level that's a need that everybody comes to media and entertainment for.

438
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,523
So it's nice to see in something that's so mainstream that...

439
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:21,838
you know, it's okay to be gay because that means that everything else in real life

440
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,820
that is also mainstream makes it okay.

441
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,542
And seeing the character in Undertale,

442
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,865
you know, portrayed with they, it's validation.

443
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:36,130
It's realizing that somebody out there is willing to sing part of your song.

444
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,112
People said, I, you, you helped me,

445
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:41,814
they literally said, you helped me realize I was gay.

446
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:45,277
You gay, your characters gave me the courage to come out as bisexual.

447
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:53,963
your playing your game got me through a time where otherwise I was considering killing myself.

448
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:58,805
Solidarity is a big important thing, knowing that you're not alone.

449
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:03,707
It's like, it sounds so cliche, right? If you say like, oh, how do you feel when you see someone

450
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:09,871
that's queer in a game or someone that you can relate to? It's just like, it makes me feel like

451
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:15,413
I'm not such a, like I'm not so outside of the norm. I know that we're a minority, but

452
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:22,617
It's great to feel like, yes, you're a minority, but you're accepted, you are allowed to be a human.

453
00:28:23,217 --> 00:28:28,382
Any light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's far away, that is so reassuring to me,

454
00:28:28,642 --> 00:28:30,103
and to my friends and people I know.

455
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:38,230
So we found in our interviews that games give players a cultural touchstone around which they

456
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:43,835
can build some community. Particularly in the last decade, we've seen a huge increase in

457
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:47,689
offline social groups built around queer gaming.

458
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,811
It's grown to the point now where a lot of cities

459
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,993
have multiple organizations all building

460
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,015
queer community and support through games.

461
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:56,657
In my hometown of Seattle, we've got two groups.

462
00:28:56,757 --> 00:28:59,079
There's Queer Gamers, which has been around

463
00:28:59,119 --> 00:28:59,900
for a couple of years.

464
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,163
There's Gamers with a Y, which is fairly new.

465
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:05,224
Queer, no, Queer Geek.

466
00:29:05,304 --> 00:29:06,846
Queer Geek has been around for a while,

467
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:10,249
and it tends to be a slightly older demographic

468
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,150
and a little more focused on board games.

469
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,221
Gamers with a Y is a little bit younger

470
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:18,543
and tends to focus more on nightlife sort of events,

471
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,703
so gamer parties.

472
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:21,864
In LA, there's a newish group

473
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:24,946
that's more focused on community service.

474
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:28,807
So we're seeing not only are people organizing

475
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:30,668
to meet each other in physical space,

476
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:33,210
but there's enough demand in large cities

477
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,991
that they're doing it in multiple different organizations.

478
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:39,272
And for several years, one of the largest queer gaming

479
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:41,153
events was the annual convention Gamer X.

480
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:44,749
It was based here in the Bay Area for a long time.

481
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:49,211
We heard from people all over the country that they attended that convention, learned

482
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:54,654
organizing techniques at GamerX from other people who were facilitating meetups, and

483
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:59,196
then returned to their own hometowns to start new local gaming organizations wherever they

484
00:29:59,216 --> 00:29:59,756
happen to live.

485
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:05,379
The only part of the gaming room I'm in is the Phoenix Gamers because I've spent so many

486
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,961
years of my life just sitting in this house, playing video games by myself.

487
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:17,454
Finally, I've figured out the experience that you can go out and do anything and be with like, meet new people.

488
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:21,257
It's such a great experience and I wish I had more places like to do that.

489
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:24,660
Uh, being gamers, uh, we're a social group.

490
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,425
Uh, a lot of the times, uh, people in our group say they don't quite fit in into like the main stream game community.

491
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:33,934
And also, I was just wondering what the...

492
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,115
They don't quite fit into the nerd community.

493
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,296
So we kind of like have that middle ground

494
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,756
where they have to create that space where we can come together.

495
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:46,698
It's so great to like know people and also be bringing people together.

496
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,839
Every other month or so we open up the house on a Saturday from like 3 until 11.

497
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,180
And we have board games and card games.

498
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,762
I'll be able to set up Dance Central or...

499
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,044
Raving Rabbits down the basement.

500
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:03,886
And then we just have a big daylong party.

501
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:10,489
I host a monthly queer female, queer women's board game group at Riga Lounge.

502
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,912
And I do a bi-weekly queer women's board game night at Phoenix Conference Games.

503
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:19,114
I'm actually the event coordinator for the Minneapolis Gamers Group.

504
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:28,979
It's kind of a way for all of us gay youth to kind of meet up and, you know, interact and meet people that we may not normally meet up with.

505
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,193
So I'm just going to pause it for a second.

506
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:33,895
That's like, sounds like it has like a ton of reverb on it.

507
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:35,116
Does that sound weird to everybody?

508
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:35,777
Yeah.

509
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:37,618
Let me just double check, because I have a feeling

510
00:31:37,738 --> 00:31:39,820
I might actually have that slide.

511
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,221
Yeah, OK, that's why.

512
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:44,664
Sorry, I have the video on the slide twice.

513
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:46,625
So that's why it was doing that.

514
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:53,411
So I'm just going to resume that right there we go.

515
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:54,592
Sorry about that.

516
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,851
that you get to actually have the nerdy effect of liking, getting satisfaction playing games

517
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:04,772
around people who are just like you and, you know, it's great.

518
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:05,833
It's a great social outlet.

519
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:10,874
So something like Gamer X is a place where people can go and realize that they're not

520
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:12,895
alone, that there are people like them out there.

521
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:19,297
So when I found a place that, or like a con where a bunch of people were gathering to

522
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:25,159
kind of celebrate both aspects and bond as one community.

523
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:26,840
I had to be there.

524
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,163
I don't know, it just felt like a really big family.

525
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:36,830
And I'm not even gonna lie, I'm really looking forward to seeing some storm drag queens so

526
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,333
I can be like, yes bitch, walk!

527
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:45,119
I'm hoping that people who are straight go to the event just to see for themselves that

528
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,722
as long as you're not a jerk, you're gonna belong there.

529
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,704
So most of those folks were talking about GamerX,

530
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:54,125
which really was a transformative experience

531
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:54,946
for a lot of people.

532
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:58,207
Just a show of hands, who's been to one of the GamerX events?

533
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:01,088
Yeah, it's actually, so not a ton of people here.

534
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:03,069
They're really lovely, and MidBoss,

535
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:04,510
the company that did it, still exists,

536
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,610
and they're making games now rather than doing events.

537
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:09,612
But it really, it was the first time

538
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:10,912
that there was an event like that,

539
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:12,573
where people could come from all over

540
00:33:13,233 --> 00:33:18,255
and meet at a specifically queer-focused gaming convention.

541
00:33:19,142 --> 00:33:24,045
There was, I think at the first one, there was a proposal that was done with musical

542
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:26,667
accompaniment by Elle McLean, who's the voice of GLaDOS.

543
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,289
There was, I think, a proposal at the second one as well.

544
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,452
It was a really supportive, positive, and pretty unique space.

545
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:40,615
And they haven't done it for the last year or two, in part, I think, because we've just

546
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:44,898
seen this huge rise in people organizing both online and offline.

547
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:47,083
But it's really changed.

548
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:53,269
The community in physical small towns, maybe not small towns, but in more cities has really

549
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:55,792
expanded since where we were about five years ago.

550
00:33:56,753 --> 00:34:01,217
And one of the byproducts of that is that we're seeing queer gamers organizing in ways

551
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:02,438
that they didn't used to.

552
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:09,225
We heard a lot of people who are becoming basically self-taught at articulating.

553
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,271
what they want from games.

554
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:14,832
And so this presents a really beneficial opportunity

555
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,332
for game developers.

556
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:19,693
Now that queer gamers are becoming increasingly prominent,

557
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,554
they can express what they want in more public spaces,

558
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,794
whether it's streaming or in physical spaces.

559
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:27,215
And it's easier for devs to listen

560
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:29,856
and to learn about how their games can appeal

561
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:31,616
to that broader audience

562
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:33,177
and incorporate more queer content.

563
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:35,337
So here's some people, this next video

564
00:34:35,357 --> 00:34:36,898
is gonna be some people talking about

565
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:44,016
basically how they found an audience and a community for expressing what is still missing from games.

566
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:51,240
Seeing someone out there in the world, be it gaming or anything, that's like person came out and is

567
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,602
doing all right, they transition like wow that's really cool. Or just seeing a woman in a prominent

568
00:34:55,622 --> 00:35:00,505
position, like I identified as a woman anyway, so I'm like seeing someone out there in a position

569
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:03,646
of power, it's like yeah that's really cool. I want to...

570
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:06,676
Like there's more people like me.

571
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:08,397
Now I know I can be that person as well.

572
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:11,579
The whole reason I started my Twitch channel in the first place

573
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:13,640
was because of all the homophobia

574
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:15,942
and the homophobic stuff that I was seeing

575
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:18,223
from different gaming channels and different streamers.

576
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:18,664
And I was like,

577
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:20,845
I really need to get into this.

578
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:24,588
And there needs to be much more vocal LGBT identities

579
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:26,129
on the Twitch sphere.

580
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:32,241
I was hearing all these stories from LGBT youth, hearing their coming out stories, or people that hadn't come out,

581
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:38,146
and it's now my job to help create a safe space on that place for them to share those stories with each other.

582
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:47,133
Now when you look at Twitch, some of the biggest streamers on their platform are LGBT or LGBT allies, which is amazing.

583
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:54,798
But a lot of trans and gay people, younger people, they will come and ask me a lot of questions when I'm streaming.

584
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:57,416
because they don't have any outlets.

585
00:35:58,076 --> 00:35:59,518
And I love that about Twitch.

586
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:02,520
That it's not just me sitting down to play a game.

587
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:05,923
It's more like, let all of us sit down

588
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:08,786
and enjoy this title together.

589
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,807
So I think it's great because it opens up

590
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:13,410
line of communication with people you might not

591
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,571
have ever met before.

592
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:18,854
Earlier this year, I was looking for private funding

593
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:21,817
to undergo some surgery stuff that was going on.

594
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:22,157
And

595
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,925
where years ago I'd have been afraid to even talk about the fact that I was trans.

596
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:33,168
In this example, like, lots and lots and lots of people online came to my support and I think it

597
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:38,091
took maybe 10 days to bring together this huge amount of money I was trying to for surgery.

598
00:36:38,151 --> 00:36:43,314
And it was just this moment of not only am I not having to hide that I'm trans but that there are...

599
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,793
people out there who are willing to step up and support me when I need it.

600
00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:51,615
If you can talk to people about video games and get them interested in what you're saying

601
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:56,958
because of games, then introduce, hey, here's some of the struggles of being a queer person

602
00:36:56,998 --> 00:37:02,381
who's a content creator. It certainly makes it easier to get people who otherwise might

603
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:08,904
not listen to conversations about queer identity to say, oh, I will stop and listen because I

604
00:37:08,964 --> 00:37:11,466
care about you as a creator and want to see you happy.

605
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:16,121
And this last couple of years I've had a lot of people come and say to me,

606
00:37:16,141 --> 00:37:21,666
I didn't know anything about these issues that the LGBT plus community face.

607
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:25,289
I know about them now because I listen to you talk about them

608
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,971
in amongst silly discussions of gaming butts.

609
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:32,035
And sometimes that's all you need to get people to listen,

610
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:36,098
is sandwich it inside a conversation that they're already looking for.

611
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,501
I had a recent experience when I had my first panel at PAX East.

612
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:42,848
I went in there kind of thinking like, what am I doing here?

613
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,430
I'm surrounded by these amazing people.

614
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,552
And my turn came up.

615
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:49,353
And I've been out for years.

616
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:51,936
It's no secret, but I just don't talk about it much.

617
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,537
So I went up there and said just,

618
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:56,359
my problem is how open to be about it.

619
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:59,562
I didn't realize how much I had bottled up inside.

620
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:02,344
I had to take a moment and kind of catch myself.

621
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,786
I was like starting to have tears well up

622
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,789
and I just stopped and my friend patted my shoulder

623
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:09,050
and like, it's okay, just give me a hug.

624
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:13,651
And in that moment, the entire crowd, like hundreds of people, started cheering and clapping and applauding.

625
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,112
I'm like, oh my god, this is...

626
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:17,413
Like, wow, thank you so much.

627
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:20,175
And, um, that felt amazing.

628
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:24,697
That was my contribution, is kind of like re-outing myself as a trans person.

629
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:30,660
Because afterwards, if you go to panels, a number of times afterwards, people start kind of rushing to the stage.

630
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,641
They want to talk to the panelists, ask them their questions.

631
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:35,523
I look up and like, there's people standing in front of me.

632
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:36,683
Like, what? What?

633
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:41,461
and I will never forget this person and I really wish I would have been able to catch their name.

634
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:45,444
And they looked up and it was me, they had their spiky hair and this red vinyl shirt,

635
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,086
had the biggest smile on their face and they just said,

636
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:51,689
thank you, thank you so much for being open and just being out there.

637
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:53,550
And I almost lost it right there again.

638
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:57,373
And they walked off and I never got to learn who they were. I really wish I could.

639
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,856
And a number of other people came up and said the exact same thing.

640
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:03,778
And I was, each time I almost started falling in happiness.

641
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,840
Wow, I never thought of myself as...

642
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:11,556
being that person for people. But growing up, I always liked seeing someone who kind of represented me.

643
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:16,301
And now all of a sudden, I was put into that situation where I'm that representation for someone else.

644
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:24,288
So now it's easier than ever for queer, for game developers to include queer gamers in the product

645
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:30,513
that they're making. There's no shortage of voices on streams, at conferences, and conventions.

646
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:32,975
People who are doing diversity consulting.

647
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:40,897
And what we're seeing now is a lot of companies are changing their practices to listen to those voices and incorporate the feedback into their production process.

648
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:50,185
So as part of this project, we sought out some developers who are doing basically good work in that area, who people are putting queer content into their games.

649
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:53,969
And so we asked them how they're doing that and how it's affected their work.

650
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:59,911
I own a video game studio now, and that was actually my literal childhood dream when I was six.

651
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:04,794
So, I mean, like one of the key things about Indivisible is that it's about people from

652
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:09,456
different viewpoints coming together and being better than like this monolithic thing.

653
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:15,059
And so, I mean, just diversity is kind of like built into that storyline.

654
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,701
It initially started out with like racial, but then it's like, okay,

655
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,702
let's expand this and see what we can do with it.

656
00:40:20,762 --> 00:40:23,043
So we've got neurodiversity, we've got sexual diversity.

657
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:29,930
Video games are what I really love to make, and they also pay my bills.

658
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:34,753
When I started my company, it was like, I either need to drop drag because it's too expensive,

659
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,555
or I need to make it work for me.

660
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:42,338
So I wanted to go against the grain, made a game about love, put Kitty Powers in it.

661
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:46,060
There was another box I wanted to tick, was to make it very inclusive, the game,

662
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:48,162
and to have a drag queen in it as well.

663
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:50,763
I mean, there's a lot of queer in the game.

664
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:53,625
But queers are included, and they're very visible.

665
00:40:54,374 --> 00:41:00,198
Having suffered so much when I was a kid, I thought, well, if all these young kids are

666
00:41:00,218 --> 00:41:07,283
going to be watching this video, this game being played, then at least they're getting

667
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:09,925
some kind of exposure that I didn't get.

668
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:17,851
If kids can see that and see it being treated as if it's normal, then that's a good thing.

669
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:21,794
And we decided, you know, my producer pulled me aside and said, hey, I think I want to

670
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:22,235
put a girl.

671
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,051
as an option in this game, and I looked at him and I was like,

672
00:41:25,111 --> 00:41:27,331
you picked the right person to be on your team, buddy.

673
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,992
Um, but it was, oh, it was so nerve-wracking.

674
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:33,912
There were all these people around me who had years of experience,

675
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,653
some of which who would have loved to have a lesbian route,

676
00:41:36,693 --> 00:41:39,734
but were too nervous to try.

677
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:46,355
Um, and I was ungrateful that I had the backing of two other senior producers

678
00:41:46,495 --> 00:41:48,915
behind me to say, like, no, let's do this, we can do this.

679
00:41:49,756 --> 00:41:51,496
Um, and then let me take control.

680
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,932
of that content because they respected that I was a queer woman wanting to write this

681
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:56,472
queer woman.

682
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:00,136
Our queer fans, obviously, are overjoyed.

683
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:01,577
I've never...

684
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:06,802
I get teary-eyed when I look at some of their posts and their responses because they're

685
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:09,504
so heartfelt and genuine in saying, you know, thank you.

686
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:12,386
We've never had this sort of representation before.

687
00:42:12,426 --> 00:42:13,287
Thank you so much.

688
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:13,768
And it feels...

689
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:20,529
amazing to give them that. I just want to give people content where they see themselves and content where they get a happy ending.

690
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:22,389
Those are kind of my two big goals.

691
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:29,052
So people aren't being quiet about it anymore, and that's a great thing, but it can't just be the smaller indie studios.

692
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:32,813
It can't just be, you know, the person making a twine game on their own time.

693
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:38,015
It needs to be, it needs to trickle up to the AAA space. I'm here and I

694
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:43,556
get our, you know, I get our audience, but I get that our audience is also people like me and

695
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:47,865
I'm fortunate to work with a bunch of people who understand that.

696
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:55,311
And we do try and look out beyond what is stereotypically thought of as the target audience

697
00:42:55,951 --> 00:43:00,976
and with Twitter and getting to go to conventions and talking to people.

698
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:06,660
We can just have a lot more conversations a lot more easily than we used to.

699
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,122
And we can say, okay, we're going to make this kind of character.

700
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:10,644
I'm not a trans person.

701
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:13,146
How do we make a character that

702
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:20,036
is respectful of you that makes you feel like this is a good thing. And then when it does

703
00:43:20,116 --> 00:43:24,197
okay that makes it sort of less scary for the next game. Okay, maybe. And it because

704
00:43:24,257 --> 00:43:29,479
it rarely comes, change rarely comes in giant leaps and bounds and it's okay, this time

705
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,261
we'll do this, this time we'll do that. So the character of Krem in Dragon Age Inquisition

706
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:36,782
actually came pretty much out of a, uh,

707
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:41,845
sort of a panel. It ended up being more of a discussion that we did at a BioWare base

708
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:48,747
in PAX Prime, and it was specifically geared towards the LGBTQ community, and it was just

709
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:52,008
what do you want to see more of? What are we doing right? What are we doing wrong? And

710
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:59,171
that opportunity for feedback, and a trans gentleman got up to the microphone and said,

711
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:05,373
I would just love to see someone in a game like me who's not a monster. And we all just

712
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,413
went, okay.

713
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:11,822
this is something we can do something about, you know, and

714
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,143
and that, you know, we went straight to

715
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:18,764
somewhere and got drinks and started talking about, you know, okay, how can, this is

716
00:44:18,804 --> 00:44:19,665
important, this is,

717
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:24,726
this

718
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:28,988
needs to happen and we are in a place where if we do it right we could maybe

719
00:44:29,028 --> 00:44:29,668
make it happen.

720
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,689
And it was, it was not.

721
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:37,574
It's an easy, there's a lot of discussion.

722
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,475
There's a lot of frank discussion and some hits

723
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:42,117
and some misses and a lot of trial and a lot of error

724
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:43,498
and a lot of talking to people.

725
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,902
But we, Patrick and I got to go to Dragon Con last year

726
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:54,085
and met some people rocking some cram cosplay

727
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:56,147
who just came up to us and gave us hugs.

728
00:44:56,467 --> 00:45:00,250
And there's,

729
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,913
I don't know, it's hard to put.

730
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:15,081
in two words that it's humbling and it still feels like it's not enough.

731
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:21,285
You know, that a moment like that is so profound for someone is wonderful and also sad that

732
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:30,149
it's rare and that it's something that stood out for them and is wonderful to have happen

733
00:45:30,169 --> 00:45:32,971
and makes it really obvious we need to keep doing it.

734
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:39,983
We need to see a trans character in games, and let's be honest, it's not going to happen until Bioware does it."

735
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:41,264
And we went, okay, well...

736
00:45:42,964 --> 00:45:47,105
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, and I'm really, really worried about messing it up.

737
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:48,525
But...

738
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:52,146
If there are people who are telling us,

739
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,527
you know, you saved our lives about gay stuff,

740
00:45:56,707 --> 00:46:03,409
if we can do something that has some minor effect on the same way for trans people, for non-binary people,

741
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,963
We owe it to them and to ourselves to try to make that attempt.

742
00:46:08,764 --> 00:46:10,986
And again, we make entertainment. We make...

743
00:46:11,566 --> 00:46:12,227
You know, we're not...

744
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:16,231
We're not curing cancer, but if something like that,

745
00:46:16,251 --> 00:46:21,335
if that was someone who did not have that in their lives,

746
00:46:21,796 --> 00:46:27,501
and if our entertainment product helped someone hit that

747
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,163
and made their lives a little bit easier or gave them...

748
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:36,474
let them realize there were paths available to their lives that they saw only as dead ends until

749
00:46:36,514 --> 00:46:43,657
that point, then it's worth us having uncomfortable conversations and making mistakes and messing

750
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:52,361
stuff up. So it's not a secret that the game industry has had a problem with potential gamers

751
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:57,664
feeling excluded or feeling unsafe either as consumers or as people working on the games

752
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,104
themselves.

753
00:46:59,323 --> 00:47:02,564
And for a long time, when queer identity collided with gamer identity,

754
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:05,305
it left people feeling left out of both worlds.

755
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:07,766
But a lot of the people that we interviewed

756
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:10,887
found that those worlds don't have to collide so much as overlap.

757
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:14,728
And that overlap can form the basis of strong relationships,

758
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:16,649
provide shared meaning with partners.

759
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,430
Feeling attraction, falling in love, and forming relationships

760
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,031
are all fundamental aspects of queer identity.

761
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:24,692
And games that incorporate those themes...

762
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,321
can help queer people understand their own sexuality,

763
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:29,662
can improve the romantic bonds that they form with others,

764
00:47:30,062 --> 00:47:32,062
it can turn people from being game avoidant

765
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,543
into game obsessed.

766
00:47:34,263 --> 00:47:35,944
And so rather than being in conflict,

767
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:38,905
what we found is that queer culture and game culture

768
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:41,286
are a highly compatible pairing.

769
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:45,228
This presentation is just a small segment

770
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:46,588
of the stories that we've gathered.

771
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:47,989
We've spoken to 125 people in 19 states,

772
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:49,349
four countries at this point.

773
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:55,961
We've got over 100 hours of footage and lots more topics to explore.

774
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:59,624
We're still gathering first-hand accounts and sharing our findings.

775
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:05,250
So what's next for this particular project is you can sign up for updates.

776
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,393
You can see more of what we're doing at playingwithpride.com.

777
00:48:09,214 --> 00:48:13,077
We're still gathering more interviews and footage, and we'd love to get feedback.

778
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:16,961
There's some feedback form on what we're doing at playingwithpride.com.

779
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:19,378
And we're also incorporating some of the things

780
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:20,899
that we've discovered in doing these interviews

781
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:23,359
into our D&D show, Queens of Adventure.

782
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:25,680
That's a live show and a podcast

783
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,960
that features drag queens playing D&D.

784
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,021
And we've been very intentional with that show

785
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:31,641
about crafting something that's responsive

786
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,582
to what we learned in this project,

787
00:48:33,882 --> 00:48:35,582
something that builds community

788
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:38,243
and makes people feel incorporated, feel included,

789
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:41,303
and helps people feel connected to, you know,

790
00:48:41,343 --> 00:48:45,544
a big, wide world of LGBTQ heroes out there.

791
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:48,394
So you can find that at queensofadventure.com.

792
00:48:48,494 --> 00:48:50,595
And so we've got I think about 10 minutes left,

793
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:51,595
so we could do a Q&A if there's any questions.

794
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:52,035
Well, thank you.

795
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:52,355
Thank you.

796
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:52,616
Thank you.

797
00:48:52,636 --> 00:48:52,896
Thank you.

798
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:53,116
Thank you.

799
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:53,556
Thank you, thank you.

800
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:53,756
Thank you.

801
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:53,956
Thank you.

802
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:54,196
Thank you.

803
00:48:54,296 --> 00:48:54,536
Thank you.

804
00:48:56,918 --> 00:48:57,498
Thank you.

805
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,138
Thank you.

806
00:48:58,158 --> 00:48:58,598
Thank you.

807
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:08,683
Thank you.

808
00:49:08,703 --> 00:49:08,883
Thank you.

809
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:09,124
Thank you.

810
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:10,864
So if there are questions, there's the mic right there.

811
00:49:10,924 --> 00:49:12,645
Otherwise a question that I have just in general

812
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:13,606
for the audience is.

813
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:17,199
if there are games that have included queer content

814
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:19,540
or games that you kind of head-cannoned queer content into.

815
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,941
Like, what are games that you found are doing it right?

816
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:30,024
One game I was really surprised about was The Last of Us.

817
00:49:30,044 --> 00:49:32,405
Oh yeah, The Last of Us, fantastic.

818
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:35,906
It's my all-time favorite game.

819
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:39,327
Something that really surprised me about that game was

820
00:49:39,347 --> 00:49:40,148
as I, when I got to know,

821
00:49:40,388 --> 00:49:42,268
sorry, this is whether it's funny or not,

822
00:49:43,048 --> 00:49:50,092
But as I got to know Ellie's character, there was something about her that just made her kind of feel like me.

823
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:56,514
And I couldn't, like, the flag in my head, excuse the term, but I guess gaydar, was going off in my head.

824
00:49:56,975 --> 00:50:01,977
And I was just like, no, I'm just thinking this because of me, like, I'm just putting this in my own head.

825
00:50:02,337 --> 00:50:02,917
It's not real.

826
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:08,680
And then when we got to that part where something actually did happen, like, that was the first time I ever experienced that again.

827
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,501
My heart absolutely just blew up.

828
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:18,889
Sorry, sorry.

829
00:50:18,909 --> 00:50:19,430
But it was really amazing.

830
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,050
Also, Life is Strange.

831
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,491
Oh yeah, Life is Strange, my goodness.

832
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:23,373
You know, and that's something really frequent

833
00:50:23,393 --> 00:50:25,134
that we've heard from other people is like,

834
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:27,316
oh, it's just me, I'm just making this up.

835
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:29,057
It's all my own baggage that I'm bringing to the game.

836
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,119
And I think it's something that we're still like,

837
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,601
as queer gamers, kind of dealing with,

838
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:36,323
of like this sort of internalized homophobia,

839
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,284
or maybe not homophobia, but sort of like

840
00:50:38,324 --> 00:50:40,266
our own queer erasure of saying like,

841
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:41,907
oh no, no, no, there's no queer game,

842
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:43,088
there's no queer characters in games.

843
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:44,315
I just have to make it up.

844
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:49,218
And then when a game is like, no, no, it's real, you exist, it's okay, you're real, it's

845
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:53,440
kind of the reverse of Emperor's New Clothes of being like, no, no, this thing that you

846
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,921
thought was pretend is actually a real thing.

847
00:50:56,281 --> 00:51:00,383
Yeah, and if I may say one more thing, one thing that really surprised me also about

848
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:06,346
Life is Strange is I started noticing early on, when I was playing the game and making

849
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:10,348
all these different choices, I honestly thought it was going to be one of those joking things,

850
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:11,789
there's a lot of like...

851
00:51:12,341 --> 00:51:14,183
I thought it was going to be like, oh, ha ha, this isn't real.

852
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:15,224
This is just me thinking it.

853
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:17,246
And I'm a high school teacher.

854
00:51:18,146 --> 00:51:19,848
So I actually spoke to one of my students

855
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:22,811
about this who is bisexual.

856
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,593
And I was telling him, I thought it was just a troll thing.

857
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:27,935
So I started making all these different choices

858
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:29,637
to give myself a laugh.

859
00:51:29,717 --> 00:51:31,278
And I'm just like, oh, I'll just do this.

860
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:32,759
Ha ha, this isn't really going to happen.

861
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:33,400
And then it did.

862
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,321
And I was shocked.

863
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:35,662
And again, my heart exploded.

864
00:51:36,082 --> 00:51:39,367
And I mentioned this to my student and his response was,

865
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:41,609
well, maybe they're doing that because they want people

866
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,452
to realize that it's normal.

867
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,134
This is a normal thing and it's normalized.

868
00:51:45,154 --> 00:51:46,996
And when he said that, my heart just dropped

869
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:48,859
and I was like, that's absolutely, he's right.

870
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:49,660
It was absolutely true.

871
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,986
I'm a little bit shook because that whole thing was amazing and I was kind of tearing up for most of it,

872
00:51:56,086 --> 00:51:59,871
especially with the creme stuff, because that helped me with my own coming to terms with myself.

873
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:03,816
I just want to say with the social mobile gaming scene, I work with a thinking ape,

874
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:09,083
and we have a pretty strong queer, LGBT community in there that we've been really supportive of.

875
00:52:09,795 --> 00:52:12,896
And it's been kind of fun working over time

876
00:52:12,936 --> 00:52:16,158
to just build more and more content that just is there

877
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:18,538
and we're just up front about it.

878
00:52:18,578 --> 00:52:20,879
And it's been really amazing to have that opportunity

879
00:52:20,939 --> 00:52:21,720
as a content creator.

880
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,700
So it's been pretty cool.

881
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,821
And yeah, I mostly just shook.

882
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:25,621
Thank you for sharing.

883
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:27,201
Well, thanks for coming.

884
00:52:27,221 --> 00:52:29,182
And there's a couple people at the microphone too.

885
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:31,223
Hi there.

886
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:37,416
So I went to a Muslim, how to represent Muslims talk yesterday.

887
00:52:37,817 --> 00:52:41,599
And one of the things he said was, you know, include us.

888
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:46,141
It doesn't, you don't have to really talk about our religion, but you can include the way we dress.

889
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:48,143
And people are still going to identify with it.

890
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:49,583
And we need that too.

891
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:56,287
So my question for you is, are we at a place or are we moving in a direction

892
00:52:57,008 --> 00:53:00,050
where having someone who is

893
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:05,564
gay, queer, how do I put this?

894
00:53:06,985 --> 00:53:09,446
That it's at the forefront of the character

895
00:53:09,826 --> 00:53:11,307
and are we moving to a place

896
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:14,788
where it's part of the character and that's acceptable too

897
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:17,069
but it's not something that's played forward?

898
00:53:17,149 --> 00:53:17,810
Does that make sense?

899
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,210
I don't know if I'm, I don't know

900
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,311
that I'm saying it correctly,

901
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,772
but are both of them equally important?

902
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:25,293
Is there one that's more important right now

903
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:26,694
we're moving towards something else like?

904
00:53:28,235 --> 00:53:30,256
That is a great question and you know.

905
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:35,440
I've been looking at games, I've been a games journalist and sort of making this documentary

906
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,341
project for a long time.

907
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:43,947
And so I have to say it seems like games as a medium are maybe lagging ten-ish years behind

908
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:44,987
TV and film.

909
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:50,912
And if I'm understanding your question, it sounds like the question is like there's two

910
00:53:50,952 --> 00:53:52,433
ways that queer can be represented.

911
00:53:52,553 --> 00:53:54,975
One is this is a story about queer.

912
00:53:55,896 --> 00:53:58,878
And also this is a story about something else and queer is just an element of it.

913
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,451
And is one more important or where are we at with that?

914
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:08,255
And I have to say, my impression from speaking to people

915
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:11,077
is that there's kind of an equal need

916
00:54:11,157 --> 00:54:12,858
for both of those still.

917
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:16,000
It certainly reminds me of going back even further

918
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,582
where we were in the 1980s with TV and film

919
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:22,564
where every show or movie that had a queer character

920
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:25,005
was it was this huge crisis of like,

921
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:27,307
mom I'm gay and it's tearing the family apart.

922
00:54:28,586 --> 00:54:33,889
And so there was a need then for a lot of stories that were very much about, like, what is the queer experience?

923
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:36,430
Because it was something that hadn't been spoken about.

924
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:45,795
And I think my perception of the games, of games media, is that we are not entirely at a place where it's no big deal.

925
00:54:45,975 --> 00:54:52,078
And I think there's a lot of value to explicitly addressing what is queer, what does it mean to be queer?

926
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:54,039
Let's talk about it. Let's foreground that.

927
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:55,940
That having been said.

928
00:54:56,491 --> 00:55:01,254
there is a huge relief when you can just play a game and have a gay character there, and it's no big deal,

929
00:55:01,274 --> 00:55:02,815
and it's not even a part of the game, and it's just life.

930
00:55:03,475 --> 00:55:08,098
Because I think that's how a lot of people want to live, and not always be like, you know, I'm kind of...

931
00:55:08,758 --> 00:55:13,541
As a reporter and a producer, and all the different hats I wear, I'm sort of a professional gay.

932
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:15,602
And there are times when I'm like,

933
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:21,065
oh man, I just want to like, you know, go on a hike, or like, I just want to pet a cat, or something like that.

934
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:23,727
And like, it doesn't always have to be about queer all the time.

935
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:28,153
So it's a real relief, for example, when I play Stardew Valley and I'm like, okay, I'm

936
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:31,533
going to be in a queer couple in this playthrough and that's just how I'm going to play it.

937
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:34,954
And you know, Stardew Valley is certainly not about the queer experience.

938
00:55:36,435 --> 00:55:40,336
So I would love for us to get to the point where it's just no big deal and you've got

939
00:55:40,376 --> 00:55:41,616
a gay character there and it's nothing.

940
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:47,297
That having been said, it feels to me as though games media is still sort of in a state that

941
00:55:47,498 --> 00:55:50,318
is kind of pre-Glee, if that makes sense.

942
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:53,290
Glee was kind of a catalog.

943
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,590
The TV show was kind of a catalog of all the different ways

944
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,271
somebody could come out of the closet.

945
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:01,392
And I don't know that games have had their Glee moment

946
00:56:01,432 --> 00:56:03,633
where it's like, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay,

947
00:56:03,773 --> 00:56:04,333
and now we're done.

948
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:04,813
Are we done?

949
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:05,214
Are we done?

950
00:56:05,234 --> 00:56:05,574
We're done?

951
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,774
Okay, good, and now let's move on.

952
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,075
So I'm waiting for that point,

953
00:56:11,216 --> 00:56:14,497
that we could just move on and just have gay characters.

954
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,697
And I don't know, the next Dragon,

955
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:18,918
actually, it's interesting that that's the first one

956
00:56:18,938 --> 00:56:20,739
I thought of, because Dragon Age is a game

957
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:21,499
where you've got.

958
00:56:21,866 --> 00:56:22,106
Gay?

959
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:24,108
Like, same-sex relationships.

960
00:56:24,908 --> 00:56:27,170
And nobody comments on it, it's no big deal.

961
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,152
And that's something that we've been very deliberate about

962
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:31,353
with Queens of Adventure, is we've got queer characters

963
00:56:31,393 --> 00:56:33,875
in there, and at no point are they like,

964
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:35,416
oh, and I had this difficult coming out,

965
00:56:35,536 --> 00:56:37,038
or oh, and I had this, you know,

966
00:56:37,178 --> 00:56:39,159
my family rejected, da da da da.

967
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,902
Because, you know, there comes a point where you're like,

968
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:45,384
I just, I don't want any more, like,

969
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,005
the angst of being queer stories.

970
00:56:47,426 --> 00:56:48,547
I just want to go on an adventure.

971
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:51,088
And now that I think about it, there is a,

972
00:56:51,388 --> 00:56:53,950
in Dragon Age Inquisition, a whole storyline

973
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,572
about the angst of being queer with,

974
00:56:57,072 --> 00:56:59,433
spoilers, sorry, with Dorian.

975
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,914
I mean, he's got a whole storyline

976
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:02,395
about his relationship with his family.

977
00:57:02,476 --> 00:57:06,458
So, I guess Dragon Age kind of straddles the line

978
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:07,739
in a way that is very nice.

979
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:09,360
Because a lot of people talk about,

980
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,441
we don't have the clips in here,

981
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:11,742
but a lot of people talked about Dragon Age

982
00:57:11,782 --> 00:57:12,442
as an important game.

983
00:57:13,143 --> 00:57:15,124
And I think that one splits that balance

984
00:57:15,544 --> 00:57:16,345
in a way that's really nice.

985
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:17,886
Great, thank you so much for.

986
00:57:18,677 --> 00:57:23,020
expressing all that. Absolutely, yeah. Thanks for coming.

987
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,984
Hi, my name is Daryl. From what I've mostly observed, it seems like it takes that mature

988
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:34,649
rating for these issues to be really tackled so transparently in a game. So I don't know

989
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:38,132
if anybody has any example where there is something that's more targeted at a younger

990
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:41,415
audience that still is unapologetic about it.

991
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:49,528
So in this presentation we have some clips from Kitty Powers,

992
00:57:50,128 --> 00:57:51,770
who's a drag queen. She's based in the UK.

993
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,832
When we interviewed her initially I thought,

994
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,773
oh, this is great, this game company hired a drag queen

995
00:57:56,793 --> 00:57:58,975
to be the face of, you know, the mascot of their game.

996
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:01,336
No, it turns out Kitty Powers is the CEO of the company,

997
00:58:01,797 --> 00:58:03,358
is a drag queen who started her own company.

998
00:58:03,818 --> 00:58:04,378
Which, awesome.

999
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,980
And her game is extremely family-friendly.

1000
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,061
It's very kid-friendly.

1001
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:10,543
So she's got two games, Kitty Powers Love Life

1002
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:11,683
and Kitty Powers Matchmaker.

1003
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:15,126
And it's a dating sim and sort of a life sim.

1004
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:19,392
And they're just super, like, pure and lovely and adorable.

1005
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:24,054
And so there's, like, you know, I don't actually know what the games are rated, but I can't

1006
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:29,215
imagine anybody having an objection to any of the content, other than, like, if somebody

1007
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,576
wanted to make trouble about there being same-sex couplings in the game.

1008
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:35,997
So I don't think it's necessary that games have that mature rating.

1009
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:38,238
I do think that there is still a lingering stigma.

1010
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:44,365
you know, that there's sort of people are put on red alert when they see like same-sex couples or

1011
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:50,029
we're talking about trans identity, sort of a stigma of like, oh well this is inappropriate

1012
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:55,473
for children. But I think that's fading very fast. Faster I think in games than it took to

1013
00:58:55,533 --> 00:59:03,219
fade in TV and film. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. I just wanted to contribute to the list of games

1014
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,582
that I think handle it really well. Night in the Woods. Oh yeah.

1015
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:14,485
couple, Greg and Angus, they're like... there's obviously like a storyline with

1016
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:18,006
them or sort of a backstory involving their situation, but they're not really

1017
00:59:18,026 --> 00:59:22,467
the ones that I'm talking about. It's actually at some at a point in the game,

1018
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:27,047
Mae, the player character, hits on a girl, and you don't even really realize until

1019
00:59:27,207 --> 00:59:31,868
like afterwards that that's what it was, and it was just like, oh sweet, like it's

1020
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:36,489
so not an issue, and so you've got your like... this is the...

1021
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:44,748
like this sort of focal relationship where Greg and Angus are dealing with the town's

1022
00:59:45,028 --> 00:59:52,931
idea of them, but then you get that extra identification in the player character also.

1023
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:57,373
Yeah, and it's very similar to what Laura was bringing up in her interview. She was the

1024
00:59:57,733 --> 01:00:03,936
person who had blue hair, about how you can kind of sneak some queer content into games sometimes

1025
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:06,417
and catch people by surprise and say, oh, here's just something fun.

1026
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:10,415
She made reference to a podcast that I actually don't know if she's doing anymore called Gaming

1027
01:00:10,435 --> 01:00:12,135
Butts where she just talked about butts in games.

1028
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:15,656
Because it's so much of what you see in your character sometimes.

1029
01:00:17,176 --> 01:00:19,597
And so, you know, it's just a goofy little podcast that she was doing.

1030
01:00:19,697 --> 01:00:24,178
And then, you know, she's trans and she has a lot of colleagues that are trans.

1031
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:28,839
And so they would incorporate that, you know, you're already friends with these people through

1032
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:31,000
the podcast as much as you can be friends with someone through a podcast.

1033
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,661
And then you throw in some inclusive content and people like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, that's

1034
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:36,241
actually okay.

1035
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,981
I don't have a problem with that after all.

1036
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:02,392
like have sex once. You can have a lot of sex in Robert Yang's games, which I think

1037
01:01:02,432 --> 01:01:06,155
is like really important when we're talking about sort of reaching this

1038
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:11,979
point that you're talking about. I mean it's a lot of like cis male gay stuff,

1039
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:18,404
but from that perspective I think he's really doing incredible things and also

1040
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:20,886
confronting a lot of those like censorship and rating.

1041
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:25,588
things head on. I mean like one of the interesting things he did with the tea room is like they

1042
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:32,313
wouldn't let him have penises on Steam so he replaced all of them with guns which is

1043
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:40,619
allowed. So just like really clever. But yeah I just wanted to shout out to what he's doing

1044
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,182
because I think it's really amazing and also how he handles consent in one of his games

1045
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:45,683
actually.

1046
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:53,280
if you, it's like a kind of a BDSM sim, and if you go too far with the NPC, you literally are

1047
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:59,483
locked out of the game. So really exploring a lot of issues, like I think within our own community,

1048
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:06,285
in a way that like doesn't feel like, oh I'm just checking some sort of like token box, or yay,

1049
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:13,268
I get to like hit on or like make out with this cute dude, but like actually experiencing, you know,

1050
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,062
an element of life and queer history that a lot of other games don't do.

1051
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:23,506
Yeah, I love all of Robert's games. They're fantastic. Robert Yang, I highly recommend

1052
01:02:23,526 --> 01:02:29,790
checking those out. They're really challenging games. And we're running up on time, but I just

1053
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:35,914
want to get one more question from the microphone. Hi, my name is Carter. I'm actually a student

1054
01:02:36,454 --> 01:02:41,318
a little while south of here. For one thing, this was a great talk.

1055
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:48,288
I'm actually working on creating my own VR experience right now, and I was wondering

1056
01:02:48,468 --> 01:02:50,269
if you would have any advice to...

1057
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:57,070
I want my main character, the player character, to be non-binary, and I was wondering how

1058
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:00,691
I would be able to explore that in a setting where it's a first-person game.

1059
01:03:02,072 --> 01:03:05,993
That's a really interesting question, and I think that's something...

1060
01:03:07,665 --> 01:03:11,287
I don't know that I have great advice for that just off the top of my head, but I bet

1061
01:03:11,427 --> 01:03:16,828
like, I know there's an overflow room where we can do Q&A after the panel, and I bet if

1062
01:03:17,028 --> 01:03:19,709
folks have thoughts on that, that would be a great place to pick that up.

1063
01:03:19,749 --> 01:03:24,331
Do we just, GDC folks, where's that room?

1064
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:25,531
Do you know where the overflow room is?

1065
01:03:26,752 --> 01:03:27,732
Okay.

1066
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:32,053
Because I'd love to give that two or three more minutes of thought before I answer that.

1067
01:03:33,034 --> 01:03:36,435
Just off the top of my head, I think just having those moments where you look in a mirror

1068
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:36,995
or you...

1069
01:03:38,053 --> 01:03:43,335
see your hands or something like that as an opportunity to, you know, inhabit a body that

1070
01:03:44,636 --> 01:03:47,897
is not the body you're used to seeing or maybe reflects the body or affirms the body that

1071
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:55,161
is more natural for you. That's, I guess, where I'd start. And just, like, making people aware

1072
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:58,942
from the beginning this is an option. I think Dream Daddy did a really interesting thing in

1073
01:03:58,962 --> 01:04:02,824
their character creator where binders were an option, like, right from the start, like,

1074
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:05,826
when you're creating your character, which, like, I've never seen that in a game before.

1075
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:06,646
It was really profound.

1076
01:04:07,933 --> 01:04:10,434
So just like being clear, you can be non-binary,

1077
01:04:10,454 --> 01:04:11,935
you can be any gender, you can be any orientation.

1078
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:14,056
But let me think about that for a few more minutes.

1079
01:04:14,076 --> 01:04:14,556
And then where?

1080
01:04:14,576 --> 01:04:21,680
Wrap up the room, so straight back to 2022. 2022?

1081
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:21,920
Yeah, 2022.

1082
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:22,820
Yeah, so back that way, 2222.

1083
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:26,242
That's where we'll do some wrap up conversation.

1084
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,423
Thank you again, everybody, for coming.

1085
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:28,163
Please leave feedback.

1086
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:30,004
Great.
