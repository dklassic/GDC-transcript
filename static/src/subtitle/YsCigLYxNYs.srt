00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:12,933
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:18,657
I'm Soren Johnson, and welcome to You Have No Idea How Hard It Is to Run a Sweatshop.

3
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:22,739
And I'll just say I'm very pleased to see everyone who came out for a talk with this

4
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:23,240
type of title.

5
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:29,724
So here are the published games that I've worked on over my career, some of which I

6
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:31,165
will touch on over the next hour.

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,432
I also do a podcast where I interview game designers

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,473
about why they make games.

9
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:39,215
The episodes tend to run long, so check it out

10
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,217
if you have any four-hour road trips coming up.

11
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,622
So the talk I'm about to give is something of a sequel

12
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:49,725
to one I gave in 2010, which was entitled,

13
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:50,585
Theme is Not Meaning.

14
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,047
I argued then that we need to stop

15
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:57,371
assuming that a game's theme or setting determines its meaning,

16
00:00:57,872 --> 00:01:00,494
and instead that meaning comes from the mechanics themselves.

17
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,327
Since then, I've spent a lot of time thinking about games

18
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:07,088
which do a good job of constructing meaning

19
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:09,689
from their mechanics, and also about ones which do it poorly.

20
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:12,870
I'd like to talk about some of these examples today,

21
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,431
examine how best to build meaning in our games.

22
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,132
Games have great power to affect players,

23
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:20,373
but, and I'm going to be bringing this up

24
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:24,175
over and over again, that power can so easily slip

25
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:26,535
out of the designer's hands, and sometimes end up

26
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:28,076
delivering the exact opposite message

27
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:29,457
from what the designer intended.

28
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,903
So first, let's talk about soccer and the 1994 Caribbean Cup,

29
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:39,104
where they introduced a unique rule concerning golden goals,

30
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,865
which are overtime goals that instantly end the game.

31
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:44,786
In this tournament, golden goals would now

32
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:47,047
be worth two goals instead of one, which

33
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,608
could matter if two teams are tied in the standings

34
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:52,229
and need to use the difference in goals scored

35
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:52,949
as a tiebreaker.

36
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,551
So here are the standings before the final game

37
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:59,232
between Barbados and Grenada.

38
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,695
Let me explain what we're looking at here.

39
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:05,897
These columns are the number of games played

40
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,378
and the wins and losses so far.

41
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,719
Note that if Barbados beats Grenada,

42
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,100
there will be a three-way tie.

43
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,923
In a three-way tie, each team will have three points in the standings

44
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:18,004
because each win is worth three points.

45
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:21,686
So, in the event of a three-way tie,

46
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,068
the team which advances is the one with the best goal differential,

47
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:28,790
which is goals four, subtracted by goals allowed.

48
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:33,826
Thus, even though Barbados is currently in last place here,

49
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:36,087
if they can beat Grenada by two goals,

50
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:37,568
they will advance from the group

51
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,409
by having the highest goal differential.

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,551
Remember when I said earlier

53
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,172
that a golden goal is worth double?

54
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:44,833
That's called foreshadowing.

55
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,315
Near the end of the game,

56
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:49,996
Barbados is up by exactly two goals

57
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:51,397
with a score of two to zero.

58
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,378
So if the game were to end at that moment,

59
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,219
Barbados would have the goal differential

60
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,380
they need to win the tiebreaker.

61
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,548
But then, in the 82nd minute, Grenada scores,

62
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:03,091
and even though Barbados is still winning the game,

63
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:06,094
they will not advance because they have lost a point in goal differential.

64
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:09,177
Barbados needs another goal, or they will be eliminated.

65
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:15,063
So, if Barbados can score a third goal in the final eight minutes of the game,

66
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,185
the standings will look like the chart on the right.

67
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,188
Barbados will get back to a plus-one goal differential,

68
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,310
win first place, and advance to the next round.

69
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:26,577
Five minutes pass and Barbados is running out of time

70
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:28,418
to score the third goal they need.

71
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,760
If nothing changes, they will win the game,

72
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,840
but be eliminated.

73
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,922
However, someone on the Barbados team

74
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,663
remembers the special golden goal rule

75
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:40,245
and realizes that if they score on themselves

76
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,026
and force the game to overtime,

77
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:45,048
they would have a full 30 minutes to score a golden goal,

78
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,648
which would then be worth two goals

79
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,510
and put Barbados into first place,

80
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,010
as you can see on the right.

81
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,971
And so, this happens.

82
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,443
Barbados brings the ball back to their own side and

83
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,303
intentionally scores on themselves.

84
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:01,625
Obviously, Grenada figures something is up, and they

85
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:04,527
quickly realize that they now have two very different paths

86
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:07,428
to first place, represented by both charts here.

87
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,010
So either they score a goal to break the tie, you know, the

88
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:13,971
old-fashioned way.

89
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:18,993
Or instead, they intentionally score on themselves to lose the

90
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,854
game but win the group by goal differential.

91
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:33,414
Which leads to what must be the most unusual soccer game of all time, because Barbados

92
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,075
now needs to defend both of the goals.

93
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:41,280
And Grenada just needs to score in either one, leading to this totally, totally normal

94
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,141
arrangement of players.

95
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,126
Ultimately, Grenada fails to score another goal,

96
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,528
and the goal goes to overtime.

97
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,669
Game goes to overtime.

98
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:53,152
Naturally, Barbados does score a goal in goal,

99
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,435
now worth double, and goes on to the next round.

100
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,076
Their plan to score on themselves

101
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,498
and win in overtime actually worked.

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,402
Here's the response of Grenada manager to this outcome.

103
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:03,956
I feel cheated.

104
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:07,619
The person who came up with these rules must be a candidate for a madhouse.

105
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,282
Our players did not even know which direction to attack, our goal or their goal.

106
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:16,086
In football, you're supposed to score against the opponents to win, not for them.

107
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,009
Of course, Barbados did nothing wrong.

108
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,070
They're just playing by the rules of the game.

109
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:28,075
And the rules put them in a situation where scoring against themselves made sense.

110
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:32,198
I've certainly had the same experience where a rule or mechanic I've added to a game

111
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,903
ends up creating some perverse incentive

112
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:37,445
that leads to the exact opposite player behavior

113
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:38,366
that I wanted to encourage.

114
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:43,010
One way to put this is that nobody knows anything.

115
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,234
Here's the rest of the quote from screenwriter William Goldman.

116
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:50,056
Not one person knows for a certainty what's going to work.

117
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:51,858
Every time out, it's a guess.

118
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:53,980
And if you're lucky, an educated one.

119
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,292
Certainly, that could be said for video games.

120
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:02,033
I would never have bet on an ultra-detailed dwarf simulator

121
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:03,114
using ASCII art,

122
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:07,335
or on a game with one winner and 99 losers,

123
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,317
or on a turn-based game that plays itself,

124
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,459
or on a twin-stick shooter minus one of the sticks.

125
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,861
Much of game design is determined by constraints

126
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,541
which are out of the hands of the developers.

127
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:29,015
Dota 2 and League of Legends both inherited their design from the original Warcraft 3 mod, Defense of the Ancients,

128
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:33,738
which had two distinctive mechanics that were just baked into how Warcraft 3 worked.

129
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,481
Creep Denial, which means being able to kill your own minions and last hitting,

130
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:42,023
meaning that the experience points go to the last hero to hit the target.

131
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:44,304
Dota 2 kept Creep Denial.

132
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,649
and both games kept last hitting,

133
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:50,211
which suggests that their existence is a happy accident,

134
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:53,033
as no one actually, quote-unquote, designed them.

135
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,695
They were just inherited constraints from a game in a different genre.

136
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:02,158
So is game design just sorting through accidents like this to see what works?

137
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,240
Consider the case of Fortnite.

138
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:08,980
which started as a game about building forts

139
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,461
while fighting off waves of zombies.

140
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:12,681
Even after Fortnite blew up

141
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,722
into the world's largest battle royale game,

142
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,383
these building mechanics stuck around

143
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,844
as this weird inherited vestige of the original game.

144
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:21,404
It took epic years to finally do the obvious thing

145
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,805
and just get rid of them entirely,

146
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,486
so that the end of a Fortnite match

147
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:27,267
was no longer this strange, frantic building contest.

148
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,788
Indeed, it's hard to describe Fortnite

149
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,088
as intentional design at all

150
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:34,029
when you draw the strange path things took.

151
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:37,129
Here's a rough history of the various games and mods

152
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,431
that led to Fortnite Battle Royale as we know it today.

153
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,614
Arma is a realistic tactical shooter,

154
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:45,196
while DayZ is a free-form survival game,

155
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:48,019
while PUBG is a 1 versus 100 cage match.

156
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,801
Nobody planned this all out, it just sort of happened.

157
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,584
Fortnite was more discovered than designed.

158
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,667
So, when we design a game,

159
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,808
are we really just throwing darts?

160
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,950
Do we have any idea what we're doing?

161
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,931
Another problem with game design is that we often overcorrect

162
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,552
for whatever lesson we just learned.

163
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,273
With Offworld Trading Company,

164
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,714
because the game had random maps,

165
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:14,656
each game started with a short exploration phase

166
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,057
where you scanned the map and found your colony,

167
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:19,819
and with only part of the terrain revealed.

168
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,301
We learned quickly during early access

169
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,461
that the multiplayer community

170
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:25,122
didn't want exploration at all,

171
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,223
because it added luck,

172
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:28,444
and they wanted no luck at the game's start.

173
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,226
So we added a mode with a fully-revealed map

174
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:31,866
for these players.

175
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,430
So when we built Old Worlds multiplayer,

176
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,352
we assumed that we would have a similar multiplayer community,

177
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,292
which would want us to minimize randomness.

178
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:44,114
So with great effort, we maintained a no characters mode,

179
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,895
where the game has literally no characters, no events, no families,

180
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:49,836
nothing that could add randomness to the game.

181
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:52,597
However, almost no one uses this mode.

182
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:56,379
To our surprise, the multiplayer community loves the randomness.

183
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,220
They love seeing and adapting to fresh events each game.

184
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,693
The lesson here is that every game finds a unique subset of players

185
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:05,736
from the audience that you think you are targeting

186
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,157
and from the ones that you aren't.

187
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:20,051
You might have made the same mistake if you listened to my GDC Offworld Postmortem.

188
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,663
None of us really know what we're doing.

189
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:28,225
Remember that at GDC, we are talking about why we think we were successful,

190
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:31,847
not why we actually were successful, which is essentially unknowable.

191
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:35,769
Like the chart says, half of what you hear at GDC is BS.

192
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,830
Half of the rest doesn't apply to your game.

193
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,871
Most of what remains, you can't implement.

194
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,611
The rest might be useful, maybe.

195
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:44,693
Keep in mind, this chart itself might also be BS.

196
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,877
For example, the type of thing you might hear at GDC that turns out to be wrong,

197
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:53,258
we've been told for years by product managers that people buy cosmetics

198
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,579
in free-to-play games so that they can peacock,

199
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:57,840
to show off their skins in front of everyone else.

200
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,301
Well, in Valorant, all animations, graphical effects and sounds

201
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,982
are only visible to the purchaser.

202
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:05,402
Your enemies don't see them.

203
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,803
So it turns out people will pay for cosmetics,

204
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:09,524
even if they are the only ones who can see them.

205
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:14,802
Besides the question of whether we know what we are doing as designers,

206
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,003
what about the question of whether games can teach us anything about our world?

207
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,784
Or maybe, let's actually set the bar lower

208
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:24,985
and see if games can at least teach us anything about sports.

209
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,307
To do that, we need to talk about baseball analyst Boris McCracken,

210
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:34,848
who, despite his preposterous name, has no relation to either

211
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,829
Zach McCracken or the Alien Mindbenders.

212
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,968
Instead, Boris McCracken revolutionized our understanding of baseball

213
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:44,911
with an idea he first published on Usenet in 1999.

214
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:50,396
He called it DIPS, which stands for Defense Independent Pitching Stats.

215
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:56,401
The basic idea is that while pitchers do have control over balls and strikes,

216
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,904
once the batter hits the ball, the results are no longer in their control.

217
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,667
In other words, barring a strikeout or a walk,

218
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:04,849
pitchers don't control how many hits they allow.

219
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,913
This may seem like a fairly simple observation,

220
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:10,555
but baseball is a very old game,

221
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:11,676
and for over a century,

222
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,558
everyone had assumed the opposite was true,

223
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,801
that some pitchers were better at getting outs,

224
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,663
getting batters out, than others.

225
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:22,028
The initial response to McCracken's idea,

226
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,750
which threatened to turn our understanding

227
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,852
of pitching upside down,

228
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:27,275
was shock, disbelief, even hostility.

229
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:34,369
Although Bill James, the patron saint of progressive baseball analysis,

230
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,392
was initially skeptical, after doing the research,

231
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:39,233
he determined that McCracken was correct,

232
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:40,994
and that he felt, quote,

233
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:44,097
stupid for not having realized this 30 years ago.

234
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,140
So, why am I talking about dips?

235
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,162
What does this mean for video games?

236
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,724
Well, one part of the appeal of games

237
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,966
is that they can theoretically simulate the real world

238
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:56,046
and teach us about it.

239
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:00,266
that we can make choices and see those choices be modeled accurately.

240
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,628
But to use just this one specific example,

241
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:07,551
how could a game written before McCracken's insight on pitching

242
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,692
have any claim to accurately model baseball?

243
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,254
The programmers writing these games

244
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:16,417
would absolutely make some pitchers better than others at preventing hits,

245
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,399
because that was how everyone thought baseball worked before McCracken.

246
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,621
And of course, if garbage goes in, garbage comes out.

247
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:27,049
These games could only simulate a faulty understanding of how baseball works.

248
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:34,835
To underline this point even more, consider this article Bill James wrote in 2015, arguing

249
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,717
that baseball managers were using their starting pitchers incorrectly.

250
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,481
For decades, teams have used a five-man rotation, meaning that there is a new starting pitcher

251
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,624
every fifth day so that each one can pitch at full strength after four days of rest.

252
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,017
James argued that teams should instead use a three-man rotation,

253
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:56,164
but with much lower pitch counts, relying more on relief pitchers.

254
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,975
Let's say someone wanted to test this theory with a baseball simulation.

255
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:04,719
Well, even with a sport like baseball that is ideally suited for simulation,

256
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,460
as it is essentially a term-based game,

257
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,422
there is no way to get good results on a three-man rotation

258
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:13,125
because baseball simulations are written by trying to get their internal numbers

259
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:15,147
to match real-world results,

260
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,509
not for some deeper understanding of how baseball actually works.

261
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,410
which would then produce accurate results.

262
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,511
Because no one has ever tried a three-man rotation in real life,

263
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:25,392
no one knows what would actually happen,

264
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,893
how a pitcher would hold up to pitching every three days

265
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:28,833
instead of every five.

266
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:30,473
Game designers would just be guessing.

267
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,735
So, what can games simulate?

268
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,556
Strangely, the best example I can think of

269
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,637
is a game trying to recreate a situation

270
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:43,357
much more difficult to simulate than baseball.

271
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,298
Life as a border guard in a totalitarian country.

272
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,543
Papers, Please succeeds because instead of trying to simulate reality,

273
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:54,626
it's trying to simulate the personal tensions someone in this position might feel.

274
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:01,030
The game puts you in difficult situations as a border agent,

275
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:05,473
processing immigrants who have compelling stories for why they are trying to cross the border.

276
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:11,238
Would you stop a young girl fleeing from abuse just because she doesn't have all her papers in order?

277
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:14,715
Who will let you in and who will you keep out?

278
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,677
Sorry, who will you let in and who will you keep out?

279
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:19,638
What laws will you enforce

280
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:21,439
and what will you turn a blind eye towards?

281
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,661
However, letting people in illegally

282
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:28,182
can lead to citations which carry fines

283
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:29,503
that might lead to your son dying

284
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,944
because you don't have enough medicine.

285
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:33,185
Is this an accurate simulation?

286
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,766
I mean, who knows?

287
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:37,648
But it creates a genuine emotional conflict

288
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:38,548
which we can all relate to.

289
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,246
Is there a right thing to do when helping someone in need will hurt your family?

290
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,289
Losing your family is a loss condition, so you can't just perform as a paragon.

291
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,013
Through this tension, Papers, Please! gives players an understanding of why resistance against an oppressive system

292
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:59,496
is so hard for people with real lives, and thus, why the powerful are able to stay in power.

293
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:07,061
So to put it simply, games can simulate empathy much better than they can simulate reality.

294
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:13,660
Speaking of which, here's a classic line in one of the game's most famous simulations.

295
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,465
SimCity doesn't actually simulate a real city.

296
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,729
It simulates the inside of Will Wright's brain.

297
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:23,096
Except that's not exactly true.

298
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:27,339
Very crudely, here are the two poles of 20th century urban planning.

299
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,723
Le Corbusier, who was a proponent of top-down, rationalist city planning,

300
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:35,905
which separated residential, commercial, and industrial areas.

301
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:42,650
In contrast, Jane Jacobs challenged this idea with proposals for mixed-use development,

302
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,772
which reflected how cities traditionally grew without central planning.

303
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:51,219
When Will Wright talks about urban planning,

304
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,301
he is much more likely to praise Jacobs than Corbusier.

305
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:57,002
Her more contemporary ideas are the ones

306
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,162
he would commonly refer to

307
00:15:58,262 --> 00:15:59,723
in his sprawling game design talks.

308
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,405
For example, in this interview,

309
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,986
when asked about the inspirations for SimCity,

310
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:09,148
the one urban planner he mentions is Jane Jacobs,

311
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:10,188
not Corbusier.

312
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:13,089
However,

313
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,223
Wright was not making a game in the abstract.

314
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:18,405
He was trying to create a whole city

315
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:19,987
on a very real Commodore 64.

316
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,210
And the ideas of these two designers

317
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,952
required very different types of coding.

318
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,254
Jacobs' mixed-use urbanism,

319
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,437
which focused on pedestrian flow,

320
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:31,098
would require agent simulation.

321
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,031
which would be much too complex for an 8-bit system.

322
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:35,132
On the other hand,

323
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:38,656
Corbusier's residential, commercial, industrial superblocks

324
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,259
could be handled by much simpler cellular automata,

325
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,961
which is what Wright chose to use.

326
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,343
In other words, the limits of the technology

327
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:48,167
determined what type of city SimCity would simulate,

328
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:50,890
regardless of what Will Wright might actually have believed.

329
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:57,594
So, SimCity ended up with a famous residential, commercial, industrial split

330
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:00,615
that a rationalist planner like Corbusier might admire,

331
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:05,158
and which, it needs to be said, is to today considered bad urban design

332
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:10,201
that leads to crime, slums, and general economic and social decline.

333
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:14,144
As an admirer of Jacobs, Wright probably understood this too.

334
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:16,905
So that leaves us with a question.

335
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:18,967
What meaning should we take from the first SimCity

336
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,569
if it represents an urban model that the designer himself doesn't even believe in?

337
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,730
Is this intentional design?

338
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,311
Accidental design?

339
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:27,811
Something else?

340
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:31,912
There is actually a successful city builder

341
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,613
based on this type of agent simulation,

342
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:35,813
based on the type of agent simulation

343
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,334
needed to support Jacob's ideas.

344
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,595
Faro doesn't use districts.

345
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,975
Instead, its systems are built around little walkers

346
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:44,056
that move around your city and do their jobs

347
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,796
so that the layout of your streets

348
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,057
and the adjacency of your buildings actually matter.

349
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,356
The game is considered a high watermark for city builders

350
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,778
and a testament to how choosing the right model can matter.

351
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:04,164
So next I'd like to talk about another game, Kent Hudson's

352
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,846
narrative simulation, The Novelist, which explores

353
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,847
the story of a title character who

354
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:13,170
has trouble balancing his three biggest priorities, his wife,

355
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,551
his work, and his son.

356
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:21,006
The game presents you with choices over the course of nine chapters,

357
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:23,929
moving you up or down in those three different categories.

358
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:25,890
The inner math is zero-sum,

359
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,972
so if you gain two points in your marriage,

360
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:31,094
you lose two points between your work and your son.

361
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:37,219
However, after playtesting, Hudson realized that his game's meaning

362
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:38,980
was the exact opposite from what he wanted.

363
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,983
My game was telling players you can't have it all.

364
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,884
Life is zero-sum. You can't win.

365
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:48,076
I don't believe that statement to be true, but people were taking a message from the

366
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:49,657
game that I fundamentally disagreed with.

367
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:53,980
Games can escape the intentions of their designers just so easily.

368
00:18:56,662 --> 00:19:01,386
I think one of the issues games like the Novelist face is that it's hard to find human meaning

369
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:03,347
in a game with just simple math at its core.

370
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,590
Yet games absolutely can teach us about ourselves.

371
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,413
Telltale's Walking Dead games provide a great example of this by showing you how your choices

372
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,414
compare to everyone else's.

373
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,895
If you are one of the 25% of players who kill Stephanie,

374
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:18,318
you might reflect on why you made that choice

375
00:19:18,678 --> 00:19:19,599
when so many others didn't.

376
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,321
Maybe the best way for games to be about people

377
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,804
is simply to inject more real people into the game.

378
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,087
Let's talk about another example

379
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:30,809
of designer intent gone awry.

380
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,451
This is Spent, a well-intentioned game

381
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:35,553
that wants to build empathy for the poor

382
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,996
by showing players just how difficult their life can be.

383
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:43,541
how they sometimes need to choose between paying the gas bill, repairing the car, and

384
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:44,921
attending their grandfather's funeral.

385
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,743
That's a bold goal, but is it effective?

386
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,504
One researcher actually aimed to find out.

387
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:57,126
Here's an article from Psychology Today about an experiment she ran to see how effective

388
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,087
spent was at increasing empathy for the poor.

389
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,721
She writes, after I analyzed the results from the study,

390
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,722
I was dismayed to find that playing the game

391
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:08,064
had no effect on positive feelings towards the poor.

392
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,946
In fact, the game had a negative effect on attitudes

393
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,308
among certain participants, including some people

394
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,009
who were sympathetic to the poor to begin with.

395
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:18,692
The problem is agency.

396
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,534
When holding the mouse and making the decisions,

397
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,975
it's very natural to assume that the poor

398
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,057
have the same agency that you do as the player.

399
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:27,978
Consider this choice right here.

400
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,820
Should you spend the money to attend

401
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,720
your grandfather's funeral?

402
00:20:31,488 --> 00:20:34,470
The problem is that it's very easy for the player to not spend the money

403
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:36,232
by just hitting the skip memorial button,

404
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:37,613
and then end up thinking,

405
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:40,275
why do these poor people have such a hard time saving their money?

406
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:45,300
One very interesting finding was that the game did produce empathy

407
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,862
when people watched the game instead of playing it.

408
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,275
From my perspective, this is a devastating finding,

409
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,176
because the whole thing we as game designers

410
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:55,496
have been going on and on and on about for decades

411
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:57,037
is how games are empathy machines,

412
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:59,437
because they put you in the shoes of someone else's life.

413
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,678
But here we see the exact opposite effect,

414
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:04,678
and to make it worse, a passive, non-interactive medium

415
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,559
is the one that produces empathy instead.

416
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,380
However, maybe things are not so dire.

417
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,541
Why, for example, does Papers, Please succeed where Spent fails?

418
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,282
The answer is actually just game design.

419
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,932
Papers, Please took the time and energy to give bite to your decisions,

420
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:23,654
either from what happens when you turn away those in need

421
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,395
or from how your acts of defiance hurt your family.

422
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:31,037
In Spent, there's no actual cost to pressing the skip the memorial button

423
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:33,239
and saving the money, which prevents the player

424
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,220
from actually empathizing with the protagonist.

425
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,282
However, even if designers take the time

426
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:43,304
to build out all the mechanics needed to create real emotional tension,

427
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:44,884
things can still go awry.

428
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:46,665
Consider Sweatshop.

429
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,891
A game designed to raise awareness

430
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:51,272
about the hostile labor conditions in modern sweatshops.

431
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:53,794
Indeed, this game earned the honor

432
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,476
of being banned from the Apple App Store

433
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:57,037
for its depiction of child labor

434
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,618
and unsafe working conditions,

435
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,240
which perhaps hit a little too close to home for them.

436
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:06,243
The game puts you in the role of the sweatshop manager

437
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,725
who, in order to meet increasingly unreasonable

438
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,206
quota demands from the corporation,

439
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,848
has to cut corners by lowering safety standards,

440
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:15,690
hiring children, and pushing workers past their limits.

441
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:22,606
This is what Simon Parkin, one of the designers, had to say about their intentions and the game's meaning.

442
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:28,690
Whereas a film documentary might piece together the sweatshop story through footage and anecdote,

443
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:32,393
the game allows players to experience the system from the inside,

444
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:35,316
with all its cats' cradle of pressures and temptations.

445
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:38,478
A game can present the system in a more objective manner,

446
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:41,460
thereby building a different sort of empathy and understanding.

447
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:48,300
However, trying to get a game across with interactivity is playing with fire.

448
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,004
This is what journalist and game designer Tom Francis said about his experience playing Sweatshop.

449
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,767
At the end of it, I thought, shit, it's hard to run a sweatshop.

450
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:00,550
Previously, I was like, oh, it's terrible, these conditions in the sweatshop.

451
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,112
Now I'm like, man, you don't know what pressures they're under.

452
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:04,973
It's hard to meet these quotas.

453
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,857
The problem is that the game puts you in the role of the manager.

454
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:12,860
So your empathy is for the pressure he is under instead of the workers.

455
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:16,974
you end up understanding why managers make the compromises they do

456
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,115
and why children end up being mutilated.

457
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,177
Now, there are a couple of different ways to look at that.

458
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:25,638
If players are able to step back and think about what they just did,

459
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:31,321
it's sort of amazing that a game could get you to kill kids to hit your t-shirt quota.

460
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:34,463
But I think it's just as likely that,

461
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:37,864
in less obviously baleful situations like a sweatshop,

462
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:41,867
players will always subconsciously identify with whoever they control in a video game.

463
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:44,785
What does that mean for games where you play the king,

464
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,367
the queen, the ruler, or more generally the status quo,

465
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:49,848
the existing power structure?

466
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,951
Perhaps the most famous example of a designer's intent

467
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:57,752
being thwarted is Elizabeth Maggie's

468
00:23:58,072 --> 00:23:59,172
The Landlord's Game from 1906.

469
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,695
It was designed to show the negative effects of rampant capitalism

470
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,517
with an alternate set of rules to show how all the players

471
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:09,499
would be better off if they adopted a tax system

472
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,781
where rents were paid in the public treasury instead of into the landlord's pockets.

473
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:19,436
The original rule set contains a very interesting passage

474
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:21,457
that lays out the designer's intentions.

475
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,999
Maggie points out that players will quickly realize

476
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,700
that under the default monopolistic rule set,

477
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,902
one player will own everything on the board.

478
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:34,223
The landlord's game was Das Kapital,

479
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:35,524
made of cardboard and dice.

480
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:40,117
She invented player elimination to prove out the evils of Monopoly.

481
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:44,521
Unfortunately for Maggie, collecting rents from your properties and pushing your rivals

482
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:48,385
into bankruptcy proved to be a lot more fun than having all the money going to the public

483
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:53,910
treasury and today the game is known as Monopoly, minus the socialist tax rule set.

484
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,252
The lessons here are subtle.

485
00:24:56,752 --> 00:25:00,374
Monopoly absolutely does demonstrate how a capitalist system

486
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:02,555
will concentrate wealth in the hands of the few

487
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:03,876
and impoverish the many,

488
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,917
which is what Maggie intended, after all,

489
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:10,039
by somehow doubt that this is exactly what she had in mind,

490
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,161
or if players perceive of the game as a critique of capitalism.

491
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:19,284
Fun is an insidious requirement for a game to be played,

492
00:25:19,524 --> 00:25:21,265
and perhaps more importantly, replayed.

493
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,711
Games that aren't much fun tend to just disappear,

494
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:27,992
and we have to grapple with that as designers.

495
00:25:31,274 --> 00:25:33,655
The very nature of a game makes it extremely difficult

496
00:25:33,695 --> 00:25:35,596
to express a strong position on an issue.

497
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:39,298
In order to be a game with different potential strategies,

498
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:42,359
Prison Architect has to suggest that rehabilitation

499
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,561
and punishment are both equally viable options.

500
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,102
The game shape box it is in

501
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:48,562
prevents it from picking a side,

502
00:25:49,023 --> 00:25:50,283
regardless of what the designers think.

503
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,695
What it can do is show the problems with each path.

504
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:56,977
You can punish prisoners by searching for contraband every day,

505
00:25:57,397 --> 00:25:59,098
which means your addicts will go into withdrawal

506
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,479
when they can't get their drugs and act out violently.

507
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,921
On the other hand, you can create job training programs,

508
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:07,643
but that lets the prisoners get their hands on screwdrivers

509
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,924
and other items that can be turned into weapons.

510
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,366
You can have visitation programs,

511
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:15,688
but then you'll discover a pipeline of drugs being smuggled into the prison.

512
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:18,970
The game is not, and never could be,

513
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:22,856
an accurate simulation of prison, because that's impossible.

514
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:28,239
But it can help players understand the tradeoffs, compromises, and tensions that they may not

515
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,319
have considered before playing.

516
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:34,822
Now let's talk about DEFCON, a game about nuclear holocaust.

517
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:37,083
We really are hitting the high points, aren't we?

518
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:43,687
An interesting study was conducted on how playing the game affected players' opinions

519
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:44,928
of nuclear war.

520
00:26:51,715 --> 00:26:53,917
The experiment separated the subjects into two groups.

521
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:56,578
A control group that read articles

522
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:58,139
on the dangers of nuclear war,

523
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,841
and a treatment group which played DEFCON instead.

524
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:03,342
There were significant differences

525
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,583
in how these two groups changed their opinion

526
00:27:05,703 --> 00:27:06,384
after the experiment.

527
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:09,746
Although the control group became more worried

528
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:11,347
about a nuclear war in the near future,

529
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:14,208
the DEFCON players strangely became less concerned.

530
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,850
On the other hand, the game players were more pessimistic

531
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,931
that they would survive a war.

532
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:23,030
The researcher's conclusion, based also on qualitative data,

533
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,251
was that playing DEFCON was more effective

534
00:27:25,391 --> 00:27:28,132
at showing players how destructive nuclear war would be

535
00:27:28,712 --> 00:27:30,453
so that they then assumed that our governments

536
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:32,834
would be more incentivized to never resort to it.

537
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:37,836
However, there is one important wrinkle

538
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:40,157
in the overall results, which are divided up here

539
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:42,358
by high, medium, and low frequency gamers.

540
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,500
Note that every single group became more concerned

541
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,841
about the threat of nuclear warfare, except for one.

542
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,318
the high frequency gamers in the treatment group,

543
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:53,620
meaning the ones who play games the most frequently.

544
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,483
The hypothesis is that core gamers quickly saw past

545
00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:00,625
the setting and no longer saw a game about nuclear war

546
00:28:00,786 --> 00:28:03,288
and instead saw an RTS with an unusual art style.

547
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,951
This highlights a huge challenge for trying

548
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:08,432
to communicate using game design.

549
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,374
If you are working within familiar genre constraints,

550
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,437
over time, both the game's setting and meaning

551
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:15,338
will eventually disappear.

552
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:22,876
A similar finding showed up in a study run by Dr. Stephen Blessing and Elena Sakosky

553
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:27,520
based on a Jeff Engelstein thought experiment about whether players of Ink and Gold would

554
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,423
change their behavior based on simply changing the setting of the game.

555
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:36,287
Ink and Gold is a push-your-luck game where you delve into an ancient temple for gems

556
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:39,729
and artifacts, but risk losing it all the farther you go.

557
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,353
To see if the setting affected players, they re-skinned the game twice.

558
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,252
First, as a firefighter game where you rescue victims instead.

559
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,952
And second, as an abstract version where you're just playing for points.

560
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:57,794
The results they found were that players did change their behavior

561
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:00,514
based on the setting, at least at first.

562
00:29:01,294 --> 00:29:03,775
This graph shows how often players return to the base,

563
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,016
which means that they have stopped pressing their luck.

564
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:09,896
In the firefighter setting, this means rescuing less of the victims,

565
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:13,417
while in the abstract version, it simply means scoring less points.

566
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:17,093
In this experiment, the firefighters would push their luck more,

567
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:19,374
taking more risks to save more people.

568
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:22,335
However, and this is the important part,

569
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:25,877
by the fourth game, the results had largely converged

570
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:28,518
and players of all three versions were playing the same way.

571
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:31,439
Players were now seen past the setting

572
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,600
and just optimizing to scoring the most points,

573
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,701
whether they were called gems or victims or just points.

574
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:40,229
Setting can matter, but we need to be aware

575
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:41,870
that players will eventually gravitate

576
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,311
to the game's inner logic and start to ignore the setting.

577
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,152
The more the setting and the rules are disconnected,

578
00:29:47,532 --> 00:29:48,773
the bigger a problem this becomes.

579
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:54,315
These four games have very different settings and meanings

580
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:56,596
with a very different set of messages

581
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:57,596
and emotions for the player.

582
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:00,778
And yet there are significant parts of these four games

583
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:02,238
that play out the exact same way,

584
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:04,579
could even be built on the same shared code base.

585
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:10,744
Putting players into an established genre dulls the designer's intent because over time

586
00:30:11,224 --> 00:30:15,926
players will stop engaging with the message and meaning of the game and instead just fall

587
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:16,666
back on instinct.

588
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:22,628
They are now playing shooter number 34, not a philosophical game about a submerged dystopia

589
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:27,710
or jaunty adventure with a lovable rogue or contemporary high-tech military thriller.

590
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:31,492
Instead players are warped back into their dorm room in 1994 and booting up Doom.

591
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:36,636
Meaning is not a layer built on top of someone else's game.

592
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,637
A game's meaning starts with its basic building blocks,

593
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:43,058
the core actions that the player is going to be repeating over and over again.

594
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,220
Conflict between designer intent and player behavior

595
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,681
actually predates video games,

596
00:30:50,881 --> 00:30:52,842
as it is a common issue with historical war games.

597
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:57,266
One of the basic challenges of war game design is how to encourage historical play

598
00:30:57,746 --> 00:31:01,588
when no one knows what the likely or even plausible alternate results could be.

599
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:05,089
For example, could the South have ever won the Civil War?

600
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,191
And how to recreate the pressures that led to bad decisions,

601
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:09,552
even when we all know the outcome.

602
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:13,033
Maybe Napoleon should have known better than to invade Russia,

603
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:15,735
but even my kids know not to start a land war in Asia.

604
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,285
A good example of this problem is Volko Arunke's Labyrinth, a game about the war on terror

605
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:26,387
that starts in 2001 and pits the US against Al-Qaeda.

606
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:32,152
It must have been a difficult game to design for many reasons, one of which is that many

607
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:37,316
of the US's historical actions, such as the invasion of Iraq, backfired horribly, which

608
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:39,177
players would presumably want to avoid.

609
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:44,582
However, when you read the rules for the game, it comes across like a Bush administration

610
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:45,923
neocon fantasy world.

611
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,503
The mechanics enable a domino effect of Western support throughout the region.

612
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:55,107
Establishing a democracy in one Middle Eastern country will cause it to spread to its neighbors,

613
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:58,370
just like we were told would happen in Iraq back in 2003.

614
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:02,033
When I first encountered the game, I was actually a little shocked,

615
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:06,617
because it's easy to assume the designer had fallen for this neocon propaganda.

616
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,962
Years later, the designer actually addressed that question head-on.

617
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:15,310
What if you, as the designer, have a different view

618
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,571
of how the world works than the historical contestants?

619
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:19,953
To get your players to behave historically,

620
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:21,694
for your model to work and produce

621
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,215
historically plausible outcomes,

622
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:25,217
you have to incentivize your players

623
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,919
the way people at the time were incentivized.

624
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,500
What was the US administration's strategy

625
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:31,961
and what did they think would work?

626
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:34,623
I have to allow that to work in the game.

627
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:36,785
Otherwise, the US player doesn't play

628
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:38,085
like the US in the War on Terror,

629
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:41,408
regardless of whether Volko thinks those ideas are correct.

630
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,765
This raises the question of what is the point of a historical game?

631
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:47,907
Is it an attempt to model history?

632
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,189
To actually experiment with alternate outcomes?

633
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,712
Or is it to help us understand why people made decisions

634
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:56,393
that we find baffling or shocking today?

635
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:00,756
With Labyrinth, Runke is not trying to recreate history.

636
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,238
Instead, he's trying to recreate the historical mindset of the time.

637
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:08,641
As we've covered, the ability of a game to simulate the actual world

638
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:10,683
is extremely limited and thus misleading.

639
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:13,794
Labyrinth shows a clear example of an alternative,

640
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:16,056
simulating the pressures, the desires,

641
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,857
and the fears of historical actors,

642
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:19,478
which can be much more illuminating.

643
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:23,621
The study of the past is not just about what people did,

644
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:25,102
but also about why they did it.

645
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:27,584
And a game can probably do a better job

646
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:30,846
of teaching the question of why people made choices

647
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:32,227
they did than any other media.

648
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,650
Let's move that question to a different era,

649
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,932
the medieval world of Crusader Kings.

650
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:43,027
Now, they could have made the game with a very different focus.

651
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,409
Maybe how best to conquer the world,

652
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:48,051
or what is the fastest way to advance out of the Middle Ages,

653
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:50,233
made it more like Civilization, in other words.

654
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:54,096
Instead, they lead into empathizing with medieval rulers,

655
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:57,899
putting you under the same pressures that made it difficult to maintain a dynasty

656
00:33:58,259 --> 00:33:59,520
and keep your realm from fracturing.

657
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:00,921
Which leads to...

658
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:03,363
lots of posts like these.

659
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:06,426
How to kill off your hair.

660
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,013
Is it worth it to kill off your brothers?

661
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:11,656
Indeed, what is the best way to kill off your brothers?

662
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:15,218
Now that's an interesting question for players to ask

663
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:18,801
because fratricide was actually official policy

664
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:20,783
during a certain period of Ottoman history.

665
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:24,346
For example, when Selim I assumed the throne in 1512,

666
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:27,088
he quickly executed his two brothers.

667
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,071
Muhammad III had 19 of his brothers and half-brothers murdered.

668
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:34,854
Eventually, they began imprisoning their family members instead,

669
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:35,955
which was quite an improvement.

670
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:40,645
So Crusader Kings certainly meets Runke's goal for a historical game,

671
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:44,549
to encourage players to behave historically, regardless of whether the designers,

672
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,612
regardless of what the designers of Paradox think,

673
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:50,575
who presumably have neither killed nor imprisoned their own brothers.

674
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:55,701
It requires creativity for a game to recreate a historical mindset,

675
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:58,103
as opposed to being just a historical reenactment.

676
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,428
For example, Europa Universalis includes a randomized new world mode

677
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:04,249
which makes the game less realistic,

678
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:07,511
but instead more true to the human experience of the age,

679
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,733
of being an explorer and not knowing what is over the horizon.

680
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:15,175
There is a similar issue with Victoria,

681
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:17,657
which designer Chris King outlined a number of years ago.

682
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:20,258
Historically, colonies just didn't pay.

683
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:23,740
They tended to be a net loss for the controlling countries,

684
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,162
as it costs more to subjugate, manage, and defend

685
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,164
than it brought back home to the colonizer.

686
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:32,526
However, a game about 19th century Europe,

687
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:34,648
in which those nations did not race for colonies,

688
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:38,251
even if to the detriment of literally everyone in the world,

689
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,553
would clearly put players in an ahistorical mindset.

690
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,721
In Victoria, they solve this problem by making colonies

691
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:46,642
a necessary part of their economic model,

692
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:49,023
providing the raw goods and eventually markets

693
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:51,103
to the players' factories and businesses needed.

694
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:54,184
It's not a realistic model of history,

695
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:57,386
but it is a realistic model of what 19th century Europeans

696
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:59,046
thought was important to them at the time.

697
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,728
An important consideration here is whether players

698
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:05,528
will understand the line between the game

699
00:36:05,568 --> 00:36:07,129
incentivizing historical behavior

700
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:08,950
and the game espousing a worldview.

701
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:15,332
In Cole Whirly's infamous Traffic, you play English aristocrats who are profiting from

702
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:17,573
selling opium in China during the 19th century.

703
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:23,296
You are playing bad people doing bad things, and the designer underlines this by how victory

704
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:23,557
works.

705
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:27,979
The money you earn in China gets converted into frivolous prizes back home in London,

706
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,220
including my favorite, a fancy hat.

707
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,543
The game is telling you that it knows you are doing bad things, and you shouldn't feel

708
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:37,004
good about the fancy hat you ended up with as your prize.

709
00:36:37,993 --> 00:36:41,915
A game's framing can matter a great deal to help players separate a historical mindset

710
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:42,876
from actual reality.

711
00:36:43,956 --> 00:36:48,399
What if, at the end of Civilization, instead of telling you how much land you conquered,

712
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:53,142
the wrap-up screen told you how many cultures you destroyed, and how many languages disappeared?

713
00:36:56,468 --> 00:36:59,171
I started my career very passionate about making games about history.

714
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:04,456
Games that could sit next to a book or document as a legitimate secondary source on world

715
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:04,797
history.

716
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:09,802
My history thesis paper in college was a game that simulated the life of a shopkeeper living

717
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:13,666
in early modern Oxford, based on my research in the Oxford Shire archives.

718
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:16,966
It didn't just model the change in prices over time,

719
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:19,728
but also your standing in the local Mercer's and Grocer's Guild,

720
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:23,511
as well as your family life, as the line between personal and business affairs

721
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:24,992
was not as fixed back then,

722
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,214
so you have to worry about your children and their future.

723
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,478
Two years later, I started working on Civilization III,

724
00:37:31,738 --> 00:37:32,519
and I was super pumped.

725
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:34,741
I had just read Guns, Germs, and Steel

726
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:36,542
and was inspired to make the video game version.

727
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:40,305
However, I quickly ran into the goofy reality of video games,

728
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:43,228
of how players will twist your games into what they want to play.

729
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:48,185
I learned that you can't just put horses and wheat and pigs on one continent but not on

730
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:51,387
another and expect players to be okay with starting in the wrong place.

731
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:55,109
And then I met the twin evils of civilization.

732
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,092
Infinite City Sprawl, which is how the game encourages cramming cities into every possible

733
00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:06,176
spot on the map, and the Eternal China Syndrome, which is how once the initial expansion phase

734
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,198
is over, the game becomes static and dull.

735
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:12,969
These effects have nothing to do with history and everything to do with players

736
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:15,631
seeing past the historical setting to the game's inner math.

737
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:22,777
So, after making Civ III and abandoning the idea that I was making a history simulator,

738
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:27,561
I had to ask myself, what could I actually communicate with Civ IV?

739
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:28,502
Why make that game at all?

740
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:33,046
In doing so, I started down a path that led me to why I make strategy games.

741
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:37,744
Here is the Civ IV civics screen.

742
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:41,349
In Civs I through III, you adopted an ideology.

743
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,854
Monarchy, despotism, communism, democracy,

744
00:38:45,695 --> 00:38:47,738
which came with a bunch of bonuses and penalties.

745
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:50,542
Basically, judgments on the designer's part

746
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,405
on what those ideologies meant.

747
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:57,815
I dropped that entirely for Civ IV and implemented a build-your-own-government system where you

748
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:02,697
choose where power lies, the type of economy, how the legal system works, and so on.

749
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:07,199
You could have a police state with a free market, or you could have slavery mixed with

750
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,600
free speech, or you could mix universal suffrage with state property.

751
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:15,743
The whole point was to defy ideological labels to get the player to see past them.

752
00:39:25,815 --> 00:39:30,198
If the 20th century has a single theme, it is that ideology itself is a failure.

753
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:34,541
Dogmatic leaders used ideologies to demonize the opposition,

754
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:37,884
which usually meant helping the strong to terrorize the weak.

755
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:43,348
From Nazi death camps to the Soviet gulags, to China's Cultural Revolution,

756
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:48,892
to America's McCarthyism, the 20th century was full of ideas

757
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,834
that gave power to autocratic leaders,

758
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,736
not afraid to destroy the lives of those who resisted.

759
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:58,189
Much as we hate to admit it, those leaders were often supported by masses of people

760
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,652
who believed in the stories those leaders told, the ideologies they espoused.

761
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:08,957
Demagogues love the labels that ideologies provide because they obscure and dehumanize

762
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:09,557
the opposition.

763
00:40:10,758 --> 00:40:17,302
Both sides of the Cold War made liberal use of the terms communist and capitalist to define

764
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:22,345
and differentiate each other, even though the U.S. government has slowly adopted communist

765
00:40:22,385 --> 00:40:24,127
programs piecemeal over the last century.

766
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:31,601
Why exactly was the US, a country with Social Security, Medicare, welfare, a minimum wage,

767
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:36,123
labor laws, and trade unions, killing people to keep communism out of Vietnam?

768
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:41,685
In fact, if you took a typical red-fearing, union-busting industrialist from 1923

769
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:46,006
and sent him 100 years into the future and explained to him how America works now,

770
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:48,787
he would probably assume that the communists won after all.

771
00:40:51,472 --> 00:40:54,953
Labels exist to separate and control people, and I wanted the civic system to encourage

772
00:40:54,993 --> 00:41:01,075
people to look past these labels and at the actual choices a society needs to make when

773
00:41:01,115 --> 00:41:01,795
governing itself.

774
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:05,196
It was no accident that I attached Mount Rushmore to fascism.

775
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:10,397
Carving mammoth statues of your country's leaders into a mountain is fascist, even if

776
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:12,238
we do not live under Capital F Fascism.

777
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:17,839
Our own self-labeling as a capitalist democracy does not protect us from charges that our

778
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:20,860
country is damaging the world when our policies hurt real people.

779
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,999
I often get asked whether Offworld is a free trade game,

780
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,539
or an anti-capitalist game,

781
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:30,440
or some other statement on the world economy.

782
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:33,101
I don't think games should make broad statements like

783
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:35,883
capitalism is good, or capitalism is bad.

784
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:38,624
It's just too simplistic, and as we've discussed,

785
00:41:39,484 --> 00:41:42,326
injecting a heavy-handed message can so easily go off the rails.

786
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:46,848
In Offworld, if iron costs more than steel,

787
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:48,329
something has gone wrong,

788
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:51,450
and you win by taking advantage of those discrepancies.

789
00:41:52,317 --> 00:41:54,078
There's a reason why everything costs what it does.

790
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,882
Sometimes that goes beyond just supply and demand

791
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:01,344
to government policy and cultural factors,

792
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,605
but there's always a reason.

793
00:42:03,205 --> 00:42:04,586
And if we don't like what something costs,

794
00:42:05,026 --> 00:42:07,208
we should find out why instead of just complaining about it.

795
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:12,011
More broadly, I made Offworld for the same reason I made Civ IV,

796
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,693
to push against dogmatic, ideological thinking,

797
00:42:15,193 --> 00:42:17,235
the idea that there is one solution to everything.

798
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:20,228
In a good strategy game, the answer to every question,

799
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:22,069
which resource is most important,

800
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:23,690
what should I research first,

801
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,491
must always be, well, it depends.

802
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,393
The point of having to make tough choices

803
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:30,773
and to adapt to the environment

804
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:32,914
is that there is never, ever,

805
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:35,216
just one right approach to every situation.

806
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:38,777
Ideologies inevitably lead to a belief

807
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:40,958
that there is one set of solutions to the world's problems.

808
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,139
And I believe that a good strategy game

809
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:45,020
always challenges this type of thinking.

810
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:52,882
So let's go back to the question about whether games can teach us anything about our world.

811
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:57,264
I hope I have demonstrated the folly of thinking that we can simulate the world,

812
00:42:57,944 --> 00:42:59,985
even on a scale as small as a baseball season,

813
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:05,166
while still showing the value in using games to build empathy for others across place and time.

814
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,708
How can we do more of that and how can we do it better than we have so far?

815
00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:16,410
Okay, now I'm going to tell you something that is definitely in the 10% useful chart,

816
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,091
in the 10% useful part of this pie chart.

817
00:43:20,303 --> 00:43:22,504
We game designers have no idea what we are doing.

818
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:26,166
To be a good designer, you have to abandon the idea

819
00:43:26,266 --> 00:43:27,946
that you're anything other than an explorer.

820
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:32,228
You know how we all feel like we are impostors?

821
00:43:32,828 --> 00:43:34,269
Well, what if we were actually right?

822
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:37,010
It's actually bad to lose this feeling.

823
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,110
If you think you have figured out game design,

824
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,071
your career is over.

825
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,652
We are not creating order systems.

826
00:43:44,192 --> 00:43:46,733
We are creating chaos for the player to find order in.

827
00:43:47,945 --> 00:43:51,727
I would extend this quote to say that designers who try to make ordered systems put their

828
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:56,511
intentions, the meaning of their game, at risk, because players will break those systems.

829
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:59,673
Players don't care about the imaginary game you have in your head.

830
00:44:01,914 --> 00:44:04,716
Indeed, players understand our games better than we do.

831
00:44:05,757 --> 00:44:09,620
When evaluating design talent, the most important trait I look for is humility.

832
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:15,124
Designers need to be able to hold two contradictory ideas in their heads at all times.

833
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,341
to hold true to their design vision,

834
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:18,902
even when success is uncertain,

835
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:23,283
but also to always assume that their vision is meaningless

836
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:25,464
until they see it in the hands of real players.

837
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:28,406
They need to have both a big enough ego

838
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:29,426
to follow their own path,

839
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:31,827
but a small enough ego to assume

840
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:32,928
that they are probably wrong.

841
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:37,189
So, why make games at all

842
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:39,010
if the players ultimately take them away from us?

843
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:42,672
Why am I still here trying to climb up that hill?

844
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:44,713
Well...

845
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:51,847
What if that infamous Barbados-Grenada match was actually the most interesting game of soccer ever played?

846
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:56,248
Maybe it's amazing that the soccer team ended up defending both goals.

847
00:44:58,108 --> 00:45:02,670
Maybe it's amazing that the socialist landlord's game turned into the capitalist monopoly.

848
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:09,271
Maybe it's amazing that Sweatshop created more empathy for sweatshop managers than for the suffering workers.

849
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:16,142
Maybe it's even amazing that spent somehow made people less sympathetic towards the poor.

850
00:45:16,803 --> 00:45:19,345
Strictly speaking, these four examples are all failures,

851
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:22,668
but the way they fail doesn't at all suggest that games are useless.

852
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:27,193
Instead, their failures show us just how powerful games can be.

853
00:45:28,774 --> 00:45:30,956
Right now, we are like children playing with fire.

854
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:34,760
We don't know what we are doing, or we might end up setting the wrong thing ablaze.

855
00:45:37,365 --> 00:45:40,067
So in the spirit of humility, I don't have the answers

856
00:45:40,147 --> 00:45:42,928
for how to make sure our games don't end up conveying a message

857
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:44,889
that is the opposite of what we intended.

858
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,851
But I do know of some games that have succeeded better than others.

859
00:45:49,492 --> 00:45:50,332
And I bet you do, too.

860
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:54,654
Just remember that simply stating that your game is about X or Y

861
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:55,635
doesn't make it so.

862
00:45:56,675 --> 00:45:59,017
The only people who truly understand your game are your players.

863
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:02,278
So if you want to know what your game means, make sure you ask them.

864
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,880
And thank you for your time.

865
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:25,349
Alright, thanks everyone. Be sure to fill out your evaluations. I know I'm supposed to say that, I actually did it this time.

866
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:32,235
And, I know it's a broad talk but we do have time for questions if anyone wants to ask anything.

867
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:35,318
Hello Chris.

868
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,742
Great talk. I wanted to talk about Fortnite.

869
00:46:40,363 --> 00:46:42,785
Okay, that's funny, we were just talking about this last night.

870
00:46:44,146 --> 00:46:46,647
I play way too much Fortnite, and I wanted you to...

871
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:52,672
The arc you laid out was slightly wrong in that the pros don't play Zero Build.

872
00:46:53,632 --> 00:46:58,396
And I'm curious what you think, since players are the ones who are the final arbiter of what the game is about.

873
00:46:58,836 --> 00:47:02,939
Zero Build is kind of considered a thing for casuals, like get those people out of the game,

874
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:06,181
and building is where the actual magic is, which I think actually is true.

875
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:10,737
There's that aspect of the question about pros versus amateurs in games.

876
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:17,240
And then the second thing is like, one thing about building is they managed to not fuck it up.

877
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:20,102
Like they took, they made the game as a fast follow to PUBG, obviously.

878
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:22,203
The building was in there, they left it in there.

879
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:27,306
They were, and it, the pros like found the amazing thing there.

880
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:31,729
And Epic eventually, after trying to slow it down and stuff, realized, you know, this is where the real game is.

881
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:38,168
kind of reading the game, listening to the game, and the players, and like doubling down

882
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:39,269
on that is really important, I think.

883
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:39,769
Right.

884
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,392
So I did spend some time, you know, I saw that they, you know, they took out building,

885
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:48,836
and to me building was always like, it's so bizarre that this is part of this game, because

886
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:54,821
obviously that was not, that was not the, sorry to put this, you know, PUBG or whatever

887
00:47:54,841 --> 00:47:56,102
does not have building, right?

888
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,704
Like that's not always a key part of what made the game work, right?

889
00:47:59,224 --> 00:47:59,845
And Fortnite...

890
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:02,341
did, you know, whatever, the fast follow, right?

891
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:03,743
They're like, we're gonna, we're gonna adapt,

892
00:48:03,803 --> 00:48:05,865
but we've got all this other baggage that comes along with it,

893
00:48:05,985 --> 00:48:07,526
and we'll just see if it works, right?

894
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:13,333
And so, you know, it's like that for sure is accidental design, right?

895
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:14,354
Like, who knows what happens?

896
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:15,595
Maybe that's great, maybe it's not.

897
00:48:16,236 --> 00:48:18,077
And so, yeah, I spent some time trying to figure out,

898
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:19,579
because I saw that, okay, great, they took it out.

899
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,380
Or at least there's a mode without it.

900
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,281
So that means they at least have understood that.

901
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:27,863
And I couldn't quite figure out what the community thought.

902
00:48:27,883 --> 00:48:30,123
I saw that some people said that that was good,

903
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:31,184
and they were happy with it.

904
00:48:31,504 --> 00:48:32,364
But I knew that like...

905
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,011
You know, it's possible that that would not,

906
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:37,291
but that's kind of the whole point.

907
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:38,872
Like, I know that the player's gonna choose

908
00:48:38,892 --> 00:48:39,812
one of those paths or not.

909
00:48:39,892 --> 00:48:40,952
Yeah, I mean, it was a parallel mode.

910
00:48:40,972 --> 00:48:41,872
They didn't actually take it out.

911
00:48:41,912 --> 00:48:42,533
They removed it.

912
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:43,393
I understand, yeah.

913
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:44,653
Like, I mean, that's good.

914
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,814
Like, first of all, that is a great way to do development.

915
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:50,034
Right, like if you're making the radical shift to your game

916
00:48:50,114 --> 00:48:51,715
and you can make it that simple, like go for it.

917
00:48:51,735 --> 00:48:52,935
I mean, it's them admitting they don't know.

918
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:54,035
Yeah, exactly.

919
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:54,516
Right, this is, yeah.

920
00:48:54,656 --> 00:48:55,696
Yeah, yeah.

921
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:59,537
I mean, yeah, it kind of just comes back to the idea

922
00:48:59,557 --> 00:49:03,038
that like, it's, you know,

923
00:49:04,465 --> 00:49:07,027
And it's also interesting that different layers of the game,

924
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,347
people have different opinions, right?

925
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:10,589
Like Casuals versus Hardcore, right?

926
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:13,271
They have a different purpose when they're playing the game.

927
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,393
No, and in fact, streamers came back to play Zero Build

928
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:17,754
because those people all aged out,

929
00:49:17,774 --> 00:49:20,836
because you have to be 12 with 12-year-old reflexes to build.

930
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,677
Like, it's so crazy now.

931
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:25,039
And then, you know, somebody like Tfue or whatever,

932
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:27,040
who's 23, just can't do it anymore.

933
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:28,821
But they came back for Zero Build.

934
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:31,463
So it's like, it's a very high-dimensional space

935
00:49:31,503 --> 00:49:32,124
they were playing in.

936
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,433
All right, does anyone have a non-Fortnite question?

937
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:37,236
Yeah, hi.

938
00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:44,160
So I was curious with those games that were considered failures, it seemed like

939
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,503
that, and maybe this is a bit reductionist as a way of looking at it,

940
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:52,507
it seems like the best thing to affix those would have been to find the right,

941
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:56,670
you know, POV instead of, you know, maybe playing as a sweatshop owner, you're

942
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:59,632
playing as one of the workers. Do you think that a lot of those problems

943
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:03,755
could have been solved just from changing the vantage point of where

944
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,356
those games were being designed from?

945
00:50:06,932 --> 00:50:11,775
Um, possibly. I mean, the hard part is I'd really have to think through how to,

946
00:50:11,795 --> 00:50:15,657
what's the right way to make a game about sweatshops. And I don't necessarily think

947
00:50:16,337 --> 00:50:21,541
that the game is a failure. I think it's, it's complicated, right? Like, I think for some people,

948
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:25,943
they'll play the game and, you know, they'll, they'll go down the path of like, oh, I'm making

949
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:27,204
the, you know, do these choices.

950
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:31,927
And, you know, like maybe later they'll be like, wow, I can't believe I did that stuff.

951
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:35,629
You know, I see, you know, it makes me think Sweatshop is horrible.

952
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:39,651
Whereas other people... I mean, I think generally speaking,

953
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:41,592
what I was really trying to get at was that...

954
00:50:43,814 --> 00:50:47,656
I don't think anyone plays Sweatshop and comes away thinking like, I guess Sweatshops are fine.

955
00:50:48,396 --> 00:50:52,239
I don't think anyone actually thinks that. I was trying to like use that point to kind of illustrate

956
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:55,981
like, okay, fine, but guess what? We have a bunch of games where you play the government.

957
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,396
Or you play the status quo, or you play the king, or whatever.

958
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:03,378
And we need to think about, OK, that framing very much

959
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,379
affects what you think is OK or not OK.

960
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,161
Where are we engendering empathy?

961
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:09,462
Yeah, exactly.

962
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:10,983
Thank you.

963
00:51:11,003 --> 00:51:12,724
Hello.

964
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,985
Thank you very much for a very inspirational talk.

965
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,146
It was fantastic.

966
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:19,168
In his 2006 GDC talk, Glenn Hawking

967
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:21,770
described the self-exploration systems.

968
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,561
that would drive player values into conflict.

969
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:27,543
Maybe that's a solution to make people conflicted

970
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,444
about their values instead.

971
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:32,666
As you were asking the question,

972
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:33,647
I was really realizing,

973
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:34,888
oh, I forgot to repeat the questions.

974
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:37,129
And then I need you to repeat your question.

975
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:38,550
Okay.

976
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,391
In his 2006 GDC talk,

977
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:42,012
Exploration from Spaces,

978
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:42,552
from,

979
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:49,149
Systems to Spaces to Self, Clint Hocking has proposed a self-exploration system, a method

980
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:54,651
of attaching core verbs into various hidden values that would drive those values into

981
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:57,433
conflict and make players question about themselves.

982
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:04,436
Maybe that's a solution to make people conflicted about their own values instead of the objectives

983
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:04,876
of the game.

984
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:08,978
Okay, could you give me an example?

985
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,620
I'm trying to understand what you mean.

986
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,580
I understand.

987
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:18,883
Clint Hawking has suggested an Ultima 4 where there are various hidden values that the player

988
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:23,624
did not directly see, but sort of allow those specific values to explore themselves.

989
00:52:25,945 --> 00:52:31,267
You mean that to be less explicit about these are your values, it's more like you're performing

990
00:52:31,287 --> 00:52:33,748
them or like you're giving a chance to be them?

991
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:34,409
Is that what that means?

992
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:34,629
Right.

993
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:34,869
Like...

994
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:43,675
We usually have in games that you lose, you make enemy NPCs lose morale, but you don't

995
00:52:43,755 --> 00:52:47,577
feel like you've broken their will, sort of drive their conflict to let them actually

996
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:48,978
experience what they were doing.

997
00:52:49,978 --> 00:52:50,178
Right.

998
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:50,799
Right.

999
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:51,659
Okay.

1000
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:58,863
Yeah, I mean I think that, I think a lot of times in games, you know, we can...

1001
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:02,756
But you put labels of something, this is honorable,

1002
00:53:02,816 --> 00:53:04,857
this is good, this is evil, this is whatever, right?

1003
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,217
But like, you know, we should be,

1004
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:07,678
what's much more interesting is like,

1005
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:08,658
what's actually happening.

1006
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,259
Like, you know, this is why I say at the end,

1007
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:12,499
like just saying something is X or Y

1008
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:14,020
doesn't kind of make it that way.

1009
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,220
Right.

1010
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,280
So, yeah.

1011
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:15,800
Thank you.

1012
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,220
Cool, thank you.

1013
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:21,742
Hi, I was wondering what is the origin story of this talk?

1014
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:24,063
Like, what made you wake up one day and say,

1015
00:53:24,343 --> 00:53:27,304
I'm gonna teach a master class on empathy in game design?

1016
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:29,400
Right, okay, so I got that one.

1017
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,303
The question is, what is the origin of this talk?

1018
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,487
So I've been basically squirreling,

1019
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:37,049
like I mentioned, I gave that talk in 2010.

1020
00:53:37,149 --> 00:53:40,553
And that one, that was really initiated

1021
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:43,816
by just being bugged by the rules of Ticket to Ride.

1022
00:53:45,638 --> 00:53:49,761
That was like, it's a really bizarre game because if you ask, you take anyone, you say,

1023
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:51,362
hey, have you played Ticket to Ride?

1024
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:52,343
Like, yeah, Ticket to Ride is great.

1025
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:52,883
What's it about?

1026
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:58,527
Oh, you're a train company and you're building trains, train tracks across the country

1027
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,869
and you're monopolizing markets and you're controlling everything.

1028
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:01,789
And it's like, yeah, that's right.

1029
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:02,430
That is what it's about.

1030
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,212
Then you crack open the rules, like, no, it's actually about a contest

1031
00:54:06,252 --> 00:54:09,995
to cross the US the fastest or hit the most cities or whatever.

1032
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:10,315
It's like a...

1033
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:16,300
across the US in 80 days type thing, I don't know. Um, and it makes no sense, especially

1034
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,363
because like the mechanics don't support that at all, right? Like, there's no reason why

1035
00:54:20,564 --> 00:54:25,448
one person can, you know, why, if someone gets the, you know, Chicago to St. Louis route,

1036
00:54:25,488 --> 00:54:27,870
why can no one, anyway, I'm going on too long, but anyway, the point is, um,

1037
00:54:29,452 --> 00:54:31,172
There was this huge mismatch, and I was like,

1038
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:35,634
okay, it really made, the designer does not have the right

1039
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:37,575
to determine what the game's about

1040
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:39,876
when the players clearly realize

1041
00:54:39,896 --> 00:54:41,517
the game's about something else, right?

1042
00:54:42,677 --> 00:54:44,418
And so, you know, I kinda did that talk,

1043
00:54:44,938 --> 00:54:47,340
and then, you know, I just kept noticing

1044
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,900
these kind of examples come up of like,

1045
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,101
a designer was trying to do this,

1046
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,402
and then it ends up, kind of ended up in the wrong place,

1047
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:56,604
at the opposite place, and so, you know, I,

1048
00:54:57,904 --> 00:55:05,951
I just wanted to frame that for people to remember that it's a spirit of humility.

1049
00:55:06,192 --> 00:55:11,176
It's very easy to get the stuff wrong, and I thought it'd be important to highlight places where it's gone wrong,

1050
00:55:11,216 --> 00:55:13,698
but also places where people have done a really good job with it.

1051
00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:17,281
I don't know, I hope that's a good answer.

1052
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:18,022
Thank you.

1053
00:55:19,704 --> 00:55:21,745
This is kind of following up on things going wrong.

1054
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,763
I was interested in Spent, where it was a more successful message when it failed as

1055
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:31,966
a game, like when it was a screen recording rather than something with player agency.

1056
00:55:34,073 --> 00:55:36,054
When you're thinking about how to get across a message,

1057
00:55:36,234 --> 00:55:38,356
if there's times when you feel like sacrificing things

1058
00:55:38,396 --> 00:55:41,618
that are generally considered traditionally just good game

1059
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:43,879
design works best for the message,

1060
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:47,281
rather than always shooting for best design that then also

1061
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:47,762
conveys it.

1062
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:49,763
Are there places where you have to sacrifice things,

1063
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:53,045
like player agency, that maybe is a worse quote unquote game,

1064
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:55,426
but ends up being better in terms of message?

1065
00:55:55,446 --> 00:55:56,827
If that makes sense.

1066
00:55:57,548 --> 00:55:58,088
You're asking?

1067
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:07,147
Let me just say that, I mean, to me the issue with spent is that they needed to go farther,

1068
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,607
right?

1069
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,848
They needed to kind of build out the rest of the world, which is like, you know, more

1070
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,609
gameplay like surround it so like you actually see what's happening.

1071
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:18,151
Could you kind of like, what are you asking exactly in that context?

1072
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:22,352
Yeah, because I guess I was thinking about like things like feeling like a lack of agency

1073
00:56:22,552 --> 00:56:26,954
and like one of the ways to do it is like make people feel like there's, you know, like

1074
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:27,994
cost to their decisions.

1075
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,010
But do you feel like, in general,

1076
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,271
are there ways where you can make people feel bad,

1077
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,712
I guess, and have it be a,

1078
00:56:34,052 --> 00:56:35,453
like would it be sort of like papers please,

1079
00:56:35,473 --> 00:56:37,093
or are there, I don't know, sort of less?

1080
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:37,633
Right.

1081
00:56:37,754 --> 00:56:40,235
Yeah, so the question is how to make people feel bad.

1082
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:42,095
Yeah.

1083
00:56:42,335 --> 00:56:44,156
Well, that's a good question.

1084
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:45,417
Maybe that'll be my next talk.

1085
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,822
I've often kind of wondered about this, because in Papers, Please, it's just a simple thing.

1086
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:58,143
You don't even see a picture of your son. You don't see you guys throwing the ball back and

1087
00:56:58,183 --> 00:57:05,084
forth or whatever they do in their dystopian country. They don't have a name. You just see

1088
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:13,946
son. Son is sick. Son is dead. We're humans, so we map our lives onto that. You don't necessarily

1089
00:57:13,986 --> 00:57:17,047
have to do all that much, so it's kind of amazing that that kind of works.

1090
00:57:18,788 --> 00:57:21,252
The thing that pops in my head is the...

1091
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:27,170
No, no, the guy who does the comic book,

1092
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,691
Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud.

1093
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:31,452
Yeah, you know, like that thing of like,

1094
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:33,132
okay, the thing we can most relate to

1095
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:34,873
is just the simplest happy face, right?

1096
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:37,414
Like it's kind of like in that ballpark, right?

1097
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,755
Like you don't, you actually, if you give a lot of room

1098
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:41,895
for the player to map their lives onto,

1099
00:57:41,935 --> 00:57:43,776
it kind of like, there's probably more there,

1100
00:57:43,996 --> 00:57:46,197
so maybe less is more in that regard,

1101
00:57:46,217 --> 00:57:47,617
but you gotta do something, right?

1102
00:57:47,657 --> 00:57:48,938
You gotta give some bite to it.

1103
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,178
Awesome, thank you.

1104
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:55,033
I think the fact that it allows that there's a stage before dead, the sick, matters because you fail.

1105
00:58:11,503 --> 00:58:17,289
So there's a similar conversation happening right now in AI ethics about what they're

1106
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:18,891
calling the Waluigi effect.

1107
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:22,195
This is a real thing, Google it.

1108
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:26,800
But basically the idea is that in order to teach an AI to be anti-racist...

1109
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:29,623
You are essentially also teaching them to be racist.

1110
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:31,505
Right? Like, you know, whatever.

1111
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:33,407
Like, don't do X, don't do Y, don't do Z.

1112
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:35,549
All you have to do is invert those things.

1113
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:38,752
And now suddenly, you know, so you can teach them to be an anti-racist

1114
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:40,934
and then suddenly say, oh, by the way, you're a secret Nazi.

1115
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:43,536
And then it pulls the mask off and suddenly, right?

1116
00:58:44,017 --> 00:58:46,739
And so one of the questions that's kind of coming up is like,

1117
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:49,522
how bi-directional is that?

1118
00:58:50,182 --> 00:58:55,128
Right, like can you then say you're a secret, like, and yeah, if you can sort of bring,

1119
00:58:55,229 --> 00:59:01,416
maybe we can bring this back to the, like, to the games going opposite to people's design intentions,

1120
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:07,323
how easy is it to, do we think, to like flip it back? Right, if that makes any sense.

1121
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:10,603
How easy... Okay.

1122
00:59:11,143 --> 00:59:14,427
Can you explain just the actual question?

1123
00:59:15,268 --> 00:59:15,668
Sorry.

1124
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,551
So, like, you talk about...

1125
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:23,055
So, you talk about games that are failures.

1126
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:23,996
Right.

1127
00:59:24,637 --> 00:59:26,639
That convey the opposite of what they mean.

1128
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,823
Is there another layer you can put on top of it to get it to once again convey...

1129
00:59:32,024 --> 00:59:34,966
To convey your intention. Oh, I see. So like if a game is such a failure

1130
00:59:36,126 --> 00:59:41,529
Then like you could theoretically get the negative of it. It's only a success

1131
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:48,012
Or is there is there a gravity towards badness or like can we like actually

1132
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:51,434
Somehow you like fail on purpose and then end up

1133
00:59:52,975 --> 00:59:53,835
End up in a good place

1134
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:59,060
Right, so, I mean, to some extent, that was my section on framing was about that.

1135
00:59:59,520 --> 00:59:59,660
Right.

1136
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:04,204
Like, if, you know, all these things, you know, it's...

1137
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:09,109
Definitely there's nothing in my talk, anyone, like anyone who interpreted this,

1138
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:11,351
like, this is, this is like absolutely good, this is absolutely bad.

1139
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:14,533
Like, you know, like, even, even stuff like spent, you know,

1140
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:17,936
it's kind of interesting to see some of the stuff going on there, right?

1141
01:00:18,217 --> 01:00:18,397
And...

1142
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:19,218
Hmm.

1143
01:00:21,957 --> 01:00:22,721
I'm sorry, where do I put this?

1144
01:00:22,741 --> 01:00:23,062
So...

1145
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:35,515
Yeah, it's, you know, you have to delve in difficult areas if you're dealing with, like,

1146
01:00:35,575 --> 01:00:41,979
okay, you're playing people doing bad things, you're taking bad actions, and so you're going

1147
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:46,782
to have to, you have to figure out, you have to think about the framing of it, right? I think

1148
01:00:46,802 --> 01:00:50,285
that that's super important. I'll need some more time to think through a better answer.

1149
01:00:51,826 --> 01:00:52,866
Maybe we have time for one more?

1150
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,305
So you think in some of these like situations where the emotional response is sort of

1151
01:00:58,445 --> 01:01:02,890
mis-applied, like it creates the empathy just in the wrong spot, you think a lot of it

1152
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:07,094
could just be a matter of like over-subtlety, like kind of without, for lack of a better

1153
01:01:07,114 --> 01:01:13,340
term, being too cute? Like I think of games like uh this War of Mine or uh, and of course I

1154
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,041
blank on the name now.

1155
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:20,791
Uh, Frostpunk, where, oh, you're, you're basically playing a totalitarian dictator, but we're sort

1156
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:25,974
of being explicit about it, so we can kinda make you feel bad in the right place. You think,

1157
01:01:25,994 --> 01:01:32,038
like, maybe it's a, just trying to be too subtle all of a sudden is the thing that makes you

1158
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:33,079
misapply that empathy?

1159
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:39,135
Um, the question is, is being too subtle causing us to misapply the empathy?

1160
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,176
Yeah, like is that...

1161
01:01:40,436 --> 01:01:49,762
Like being really, you know, like going into like, like, like, hey, you're playing a sweatshop manager and, you know, that's not, you know, you already should feel bad before you start the game, maybe, right?

1162
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:55,987
Like, uh, yeah, I'm having a hard time thinking on the spot to like figure out exactly what to do about this.

1163
01:01:56,027 --> 01:02:00,189
But, um, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1164
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:00,490
I mean, that.

1165
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:10,408
You know, I do think a lot about, you know, people, a person playing a game where, you know, they're controlling a country and the country does bad things, right?

1166
01:02:10,488 --> 01:02:13,069
And they don't think about their own responsibility because that's just...

1167
01:02:14,209 --> 01:02:16,230
They don't think necessarily about...

1168
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:24,651
They don't necessarily apply that to their own thinking about the world because, you

1169
01:02:24,692 --> 01:02:26,513
know, that's just what you do in a video game, right?

1170
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:30,776
And to some extent I don't think we'll ever get away from that a little bit, right?

1171
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:36,500
Because like it is still fun to play Civ and conquer the world, but you know, we need,

1172
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:36,761
we...

1173
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:40,203
We do need to be a little more, yeah,

1174
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,464
I think we do need a little more explicit

1175
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:44,046
in games like that to, I don't know,

1176
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:47,189
we don't need like a Civ content warning or something,

1177
01:02:47,229 --> 01:02:50,031
but like, you know, like warning, you know.

1178
01:02:50,752 --> 01:02:51,853
Warning might be colonial.
