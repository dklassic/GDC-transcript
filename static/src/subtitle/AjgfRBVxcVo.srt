00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:07,977
Welcome to the already, unfortunately, last session

2
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:10,059
of the first Indie Game Summit day.

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,299
There's another day tomorrow.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,481
More talks in this room than the one next door.

5
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:17,023
I have the pleasure to introduce you to Sabine Herr,

6
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:20,565
who's gonna give you a talk titled Designing for Grief.

7
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:21,466
Let's give her a big hand.

8
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:22,967
Thank you.

9
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,228
Thank you.

10
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:24,928
Thank you.

11
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:25,949
Thank you.

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,770
Thank you.

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,031
Thank you.

14
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:29,271
Thank you.

15
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:29,711
Thank you.

16
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:29,931
Thank you.

17
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:30,311
Thank you.

18
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:30,592
Thank you.

19
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:31,012
Thank you.

20
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:31,352
Thank you.

21
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:31,612
Thank you.

22
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,923
Before I start, two reminders.

23
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:39,129
One of them, please turn off any noise makers you might have turned on.

24
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,138
And the second one is you will receive an evaluation link, so please make sure to take

25
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:47,240
the evaluation later.

26
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,030
So I want to start by a little note about myself.

27
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,771
I am a cultural researcher and a game designer.

28
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:01,452
And I'm interested in intimate experience and how we can express them through games and play.

29
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:06,013
And I'm part of something called the Copenhagen Game Collective,

30
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:13,435
which is a Denmark-based, multi-gender, multi-interest collective of artists, game makers, indies.

31
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:23,102
academics and we organize a game culture event in Scandinavia, but we also make small experimental

32
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:28,747
games about themes which the big players in the industry can't or won't address.

33
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:38,355
So you might maybe be familiar with the 2008 Darkroom sex game in which players swing custom

34
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:40,537
controllers to achieve mutual orgasms.

35
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,399
But I've been...

36
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:49,898
involved in projects like Lovebirds, which is a physical multiplayer beaking experience

37
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:55,562
in which players wear giant beak masks to find each other's sensitive spots and make

38
00:01:55,602 --> 00:02:00,406
their lights flash, while accompanied by live music.

39
00:02:01,827 --> 00:02:02,488
I've also been

40
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:07,576
working on a game called Can't Touch This, as you heard correctly.

41
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:16,518
It's a meditative coloring app based on the beautiful and iconic images of T. Corrin's

42
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:17,658
Can't Coloring book.

43
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:28,081
But today I'm going to talk about something different, namely a game called Jok'Hoi, which

44
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,421
is about love, loss, and grief.

45
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,137
in video games and I made it as part of my PhD research on the question how game designers

46
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,379
can become better at designing for grief.

47
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:47,037
And I made it with four Austrian women who have lost a pregnancy and who were willing

48
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:49,698
to explore new ways of talking about this experience.

49
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:55,199
And I found them via a self-help group for bereaved parents in Vienna.

50
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:02,900
And for the tech part, I worked with an awesome student team from Aalborg University, Copenhagen.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,241
And we had one semester to make it.

52
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:08,941
So...

53
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:19,158
For me, bereavement and being a bereaved mother is an ordinary experience and it's sort of

54
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:25,765
part of my everyday life and of many lives of women I know, and it's part of who we are

55
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,408
and how we explore life and how we also have fun.

56
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,891
So I noticed that this is

57
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:34,935
Although it's so common, it's also a very silenced experience.

58
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,596
And wherever I looked, representations of it were missing.

59
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:43,358
So it was very important to me to go and try to make space

60
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:47,859
for it in video games, which is a medium that many people

61
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,941
of my generation are very intimate with.

62
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:56,783
And today I'm gonna talk about the challenges,

63
00:03:56,943 --> 00:04:01,445
some of the challenges we encountered while trying that out.

64
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:03,594
while making a grief game.

65
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:06,296
So these three challenges that I'm going to talk about today

66
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:09,618
are how did we include lived experience,

67
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,279
the real people, into game design?

68
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:17,984
Secondly, how did we actually translate their experiences

69
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:19,906
into gameplay and game aesthetics?

70
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,208
And thirdly, of course, what's the impact?

71
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:26,030
What can a game like this achieve,

72
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,393
or how does it work in the lives of the players?

73
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:33,084
But let me start from the beginning.

74
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,865
So when we look at most games today,

75
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:40,626
we look at death, we look at loss.

76
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:45,026
Death is everywhere and mortality is everywhere.

77
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,447
But mortality in most games is also a lie

78
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:53,768
because mortality or game over means that we can try again

79
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:56,188
and this kind of trivializes loss

80
00:04:56,348 --> 00:05:00,929
or it also disables grief experiences too.

81
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:08,579
to be relevant. But now as an indie and someone who knows the field, you might say, there

82
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,503
have also been other games made about the grief experience. We have games that have

83
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:23,968
actually been good at portraying this experience. Just look at Brothers, for instance, a game

84
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,489
where you explore an experience.

85
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,984
and a relationship between two brothers who go through magical and mysterious and dangerous

86
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:38,627
adventures before, spoilers, one of them dies.

87
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:45,350
And you actually explore this connection of your brother relationship after death through

88
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,433
the game mechanics and through the control scheme.

89
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:56,496
And then of course there has been the game called Dead Dragon Cancer, which

90
00:05:57,818 --> 00:06:03,841
allows us to walk a bit of a piece of the way with a dad who is going through the experience

91
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:06,822
of losing his son to cancer.

92
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:20,168
And these have been very important video games which have shown that deep approaches to game

93
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,969
making and grief exist.

94
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:33,652
But they have also used a white cis-male experience point of view to mediate this experience, to mediate grief.

95
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:43,095
So game designers in the past, or in the recent past, have started to look for alternatives or

96
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:51,714
for tonitives to this perspective as the one perspective that is supposed to tell us what

97
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:56,637
to feel from this cis male perspective.

98
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:05,942
In her micro talk at last year's GDC, Henrike Lode, for instance, has argued that the majority

99
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:12,986
of game developers according to IGDA are white, male, hetero, able-bodied, cisgender.

100
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:18,259
university or college educated and have not experienced discrimination.

101
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:24,541
And this is also the point of view of the heroes that are portrayed in most games.

102
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:28,782
So, she calls them default humans.

103
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:34,003
And they are the one minority that is overly represented in the media, not only in video games,

104
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:39,744
in power positions as the heroes of our stories and the people that we talk about

105
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:42,765
when we don't use any modifiers, the normal people.

106
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:49,364
So looking for non-default grief experiences,

107
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:53,426
I was asking where are all the bereaved mothers,

108
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,047
sisters and daughters in video games?

109
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:01,610
And in order to invite them, I wanted to work with others,

110
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,852
not only to explore my own experience as bereaved mother,

111
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,933
but to actually work with other perspectives on it,

112
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,534
with other women.

113
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:12,976
So how did we do that?

114
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:24,056
When I contacted the self-help group, I got responses from four Austrian, white, middle-class

115
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,977
women who were very happy to join the project.

116
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:36,140
They were, like me, white enough to notice their invisibility as bereaved mothers, but

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,761
unlike me, they were not interested at all in video games.

118
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:44,363
They were interested in sharing their own experiences, but they did not feel safe.

119
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:53,657
with video games. They rejected what they assumed were video game values. They believed

120
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:59,679
that video games could never represent their experience. So now I'm not the first one who

121
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:06,941
has worked with people who do not like video games. Game developer Bree Code has actually

122
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:13,803
written quite a lot about this. And she points out that the reason she makes

123
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:17,120
games with people who do not like video games,

124
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:19,662
is that

125
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,983
it's inspiring

126
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:25,226
to challenge the boundaries of what is

127
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:26,987
now established as

128
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:28,588
game making.

129
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:29,729
So,

130
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,370
because people

131
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,333
who do not like video games

132
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:40,477
expect something else to entertain them, we have to change our paradigms of how

133
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,098
we make games.

134
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,360
And...

135
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:50,094
I was very, so, but the challenge was that I would still have to talk to them somehow,

136
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:53,095
make a game, and address them as design partners.

137
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,255
So how did I do that?

138
00:09:55,035 --> 00:10:05,858
So I found the Muse-based game design approach by Riley Khaled quite inspiring because it

139
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:12,599
addresses the relationship between designer and a participant in terms of an artist-muse

140
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:19,029
So the artists have the responsibility of making the game,

141
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,552
but the muses can be there and express freely

142
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,734
what their opinions and feelings are,

143
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:30,619
and that then inspires the game design constraints.

144
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:36,908
But sometimes it's quite difficult to talk freely and openly about your experience,

145
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:43,650
especially if it's something as complex as your relationship to a dead child.

146
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:50,893
So sometimes it's easier to do so through images, through metaphors.

147
00:10:52,354 --> 00:10:57,556
That's where Doris Rusch's method of metaphorical game design came in handy.

148
00:10:58,156 --> 00:10:59,957
So Doris says that...

149
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:07,115
Metaphors can help game designers make something very abstract and complicated tangible by

150
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:12,039
translating it into symbolic images, into a symbolic system.

151
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,104
One example that she's shown is in her game Elude, which tackles depression.

152
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:26,884
This game works with spatial metaphors of up and down to make this experience tangible.

153
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:32,528
So you go through happy and sad phases and there's also the option of suicide in the

154
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:32,748
end.

155
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:43,256
But to give you an idea of how we carried out metaphorical game design, I would actually

156
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:46,158
like to invite you to do a little exercise with me.

157
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:50,501
Are you ready?

158
00:11:54,653 --> 00:12:01,357
So I would like you to close your eyes or fixate the point in front of you that you

159
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:02,498
see on the slide.

160
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,982
And now think about a person that you loved and lost.

161
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:14,545
It can be anyone.

162
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:18,907
It can be a lover, a friend, a family member, a pet.

163
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:26,214
And now think about visiting this person.

164
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:29,556
Travel to wherever this person is right now and

165
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:34,019
the planet where this person lives.

166
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,302
Now, what do you see?

167
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,064
What does the space look like?

168
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:43,546
What do you hear?

169
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,069
Is there something that you can do?

170
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:51,531
Who else is there?

171
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:56,849
What can't you do?

172
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,570
Is there something you can't do?

173
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:10,393
So if you have your eyes closed, I would like you to ask you to open them now.

174
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:19,035
So what you have done now is that you moved from an abstract idea of grief

175
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:24,556
or what it's like to be connected to someone you lost or something you lost.

176
00:13:27,662 --> 00:13:35,311
You translated that into a very concrete image, or even a system, even a rule set of

177
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,692
what you can do and you can't do.

178
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,198
And it's very likely that these images are very different.

179
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:45,020
These planets are very different.

180
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,565
At least that's what we experienced when we did this exercise with the four women.

181
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,908
So here are the planets that the four women made.

182
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:58,192
The first planet revolves around the image of a sheep that looks across a river.

183
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,355
And the river is separating the sheep from her son.

184
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,179
And the sheep is conflicted now. What can she do?

185
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,443
She is in the observer role, but she might be able to walk through the river,

186
00:14:10,503 --> 00:14:12,425
but it's not time yet to do that.

187
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:17,810
It's very important to stay connected and to admire the other side of the river,

188
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,133
but there's also a flock waiting on this side of the river,

189
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,635
which you can't see, but it's there.

190
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,003
The second image is a cave, a very cozy cave,

191
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:34,645
and in the very inner cave lives the baby.

192
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:39,648
And the whole family visits the planet to nurture the baby in the inner cave,

193
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:43,090
and there is an objective or a rule on this planet.

194
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,853
The baby needs to be fed or nurtured in order to

195
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:52,795
be made strong enough to survive when the family...

196
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,069
leaves the planet in a spaceship.

197
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,955
So that's the objective.

198
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,519
The third planet...

199
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,324
revolved around a fireside and

200
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:11,648
the flames that illuminated different parts of the experience, some shards and

201
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:16,971
some treasures that were sometimes visible depending on where the parents

202
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,792
stood and looked at the experience.

203
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:22,974
There was beauty and worry in the situation depending on

204
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:23,955
who you were,

205
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,196
whether you were the father or the mother.

206
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:27,837
And finally,

207
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:31,980
We had a model which was all about bliss.

208
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,122
It was about staying connected on a beautiful meadow.

209
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,124
The atmosphere was very important.

210
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:45,288
The mother and the child explored the nature while the weather changed

211
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:50,311
from sunny to rainy to snowy and nothing was really harmful there.

212
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,573
It was only about being there in a timeless way.

213
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:01,393
So we had rich brainstorming materials, but how to actually translate them into gameplay,

214
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,554
these images.

215
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:09,637
So the most important themes that we realized were there was nurturing and spending time

216
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:11,778
with the babies.

217
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,455
And also the wish to have an ongoing connection, but we also wanted to make a game about grief.

218
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:27,204
So we realized that we wanted to first make the mother-child connection playable in a

219
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:33,650
beautiful way, and then throw the player into a scenario where this connection could no

220
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,711
longer be realized.

221
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:45,221
So in Jokora you play as a sheep mother who explores her meadow with a little lamb

222
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:49,529
until an earthquake takes the baby away.

223
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:05,976
What is important here is that the lamb always follows the mother everywhere she goes.

224
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:11,658
So they explore the meadow together and we wanted to express that there's an intimate

225
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:14,279
connection that cannot really be disrupted.

226
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,321
Secondly, your objective is to graze and nurture the lamb by feeding the flowers on the meadow.

227
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:28,343
And we express this through a simple control scheme, namely left and right mouse button.

228
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:34,394
We wanted to say you can care for yourself, but you can,

229
00:17:34,694 --> 00:17:36,775
what is most important is to care for your baby.

230
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,539
And since the left mouse button is conventionally more used,

231
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:45,440
we mapped the act of caring for the baby

232
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,781
on the left mouse button.

233
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,203
So we actually want the player to briefly forget

234
00:17:50,283 --> 00:17:51,984
that there is something called self-care.

235
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:56,026
We want them to believe that all you need to do in the game

236
00:17:56,106 --> 00:17:58,588
is to click left on a flower to feed the baby.

237
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:08,233
We also wanted to make this act of caring important and effectful, so we added consequences.

238
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:14,837
So each flower has a unique color, pattern, and sound, and when the mother feeds the flower to the baby,

239
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:21,161
the colors actually show up on the fur, so they get printed on the fur, on the lamb,

240
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:25,344
and a melody is played also, the melody of the flower.

241
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:25,404
So.

242
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:33,396
We kind of wanted to evoke this need or wish to dress the baby, to make decisions that

243
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:37,278
are important as a parent, to make this baby feel safe and comfortable.

244
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:41,479
And the warmth and attention you give actually matters.

245
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,720
That's what we wanted to say.

246
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:51,843
Finally, the sheep mother is not alone, but there's a flock waiting in the background.

247
00:18:55,841 --> 00:19:02,446
And it waits until the mother is done with the feeding and admiring of the fur,

248
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,488
and maybe changing the dress a little bit.

249
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:13,514
And when they get tired from all the exploring, they can move towards the flock and lie down and cuddle.

250
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:16,757
And while they sleep...

251
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:22,657
The seasons will go by and players can decide when to wake up

252
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:27,119
to start grazing again and explore different flowers.

253
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,922
However, at some point in time, at a random point, there will be an earthquake.

254
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:38,924
And when the sheep mother wakes up alone,

255
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:43,346
there's a river but the lamb is no longer there.

256
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:49,025
That the lamb is gone means that the left mouse button can no longer be used.

257
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:57,929
But when it is pressed anyways, as you're used to, the players will hear something.

258
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,492
They will hear the desperate cry of the mother, but she won't budge.

259
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,594
And this moment of control loss was very important.

260
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:16,261
But when the player remembers that there's actually self-care, they can click on the

261
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:21,405
river and be able to access and look over the other side of the river.

262
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:26,989
They will see two wolves and one of them is a baby wearing something which looks a bit

263
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,870
like the fur the lamb used to wear.

264
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,034
She can walk towards it by holding down the left mouse button, but all she will see is

265
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:35,595
a brief message.

266
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,676
And what she can do then is...

267
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:47,886
to eat the patches of grass of the flowers that now protect the flowers and can sort

268
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,869
of nourish herself on the memories of her child.

269
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,116
And if she discovers and takes in all the flowers that she had fed to the lamb before

270
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,221
She can move on with the flock and explore a new meadow.

271
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,681
So this is basically the game.

272
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:08,782
And I'll spoil it all.

273
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,863
So we wanted to see whether this actually worked, and

274
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:16,384
what kind of impact this had on the mother.

275
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,625
So we play tested it on a couple of different people.

276
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,926
We play tested it on students, friends, but also, most

277
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:22,986
importantly, the muses.

278
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:26,007
And it's

279
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:32,007
This is where we made a quite surprising discovery.

280
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:39,048
So when we asked the muses for their spontaneous responses of what they thought of the game,

281
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:43,969
they had very different interpretations of what was going on.

282
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:56,812
For some, the wolf character, the little wolf character, was an enemy that had eaten the lamb.

283
00:21:57,612 --> 00:21:57,732
And...

284
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,877
had sort of, was the predator.

285
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:05,979
For others, it was clear that the small wolf was the baby,

286
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:09,400
the lamb baby in a different shape in afterlife.

287
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,822
Some players felt guilt about feeding the wrong flowers

288
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:17,343
to their lamb, so it died.

289
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:21,184
Others experienced the act of feeding flowers

290
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,864
as something beautiful and meditative.

291
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:24,485
Some muses...

292
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:32,329
Some people found the game a bit boring, others found it engaging, but here's the thing.

293
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,314
What they all said is that the game resonated with their own personal experience.

294
00:22:39,515 --> 00:22:40,616
So how is this possible?

295
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:47,602
How can something that has different meanings and is understood in widely different ways

296
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,945
be relevant for people, personally relevant?

297
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:54,047
Is this?

298
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:58,803
where the importance of ambiguity came in.

299
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:04,906
And the idea that because we left the symbolism of the game open

300
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,627
and didn't explain to the players what this was all about,

301
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:14,791
they felt free to project their own narratives and their own grief stories onto the game.

302
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:18,072
And they were able to explore their own emotions like guilt and hope,

303
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:19,753
maybe for a connection after death.

304
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,215
And they used, basically they used the game

305
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:27,116
as a canvas for projection of their own grief.

306
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:29,438
So,

307
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:35,420
Jokoi gave them sort of a possibility

308
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,462
to journey through loss, through love and loss,

309
00:23:40,543 --> 00:23:44,525
but it did not tell them what love and loss is.

310
00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:45,985
It made them

311
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,832
It gave them a platform to explore what that was.

312
00:23:55,413 --> 00:24:00,495
So, again, while we decided what went into the game,

313
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:05,217
ambiguity left the details of interpretation

314
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:06,878
up to the players.

315
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:12,280
So, here are the three ways of how we sort of tackle

316
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,541
the challenges of designing for grief.

317
00:24:19,735 --> 00:24:27,980
First, MuseBase game design allowed us to include people who did not believe in video

318
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,941
games, who thought that video games were not for them.

319
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:43,429
Secondly, metaphors helped us to not only make something abstract concrete, but to translate

320
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:45,910
these images into actual gameplay.

321
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:57,620
And thirdly, and most importantly to me, ambiguity was a way of actually connecting the game to the players' lives

322
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,342
without telling them what to feel.

323
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:10,729
And to conclude, it's maybe most important that designing for Grief opened a space for...

324
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:17,782
The exploration of different feelings and opening a space in which we as bereaved mothers

325
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:20,383
did not only feel comfortable but also visible.

326
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:26,307
And Joko was kind of like a monument for this visibility.

327
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:32,050
But in order to make grief generally more speakable, it's important to create a lot

328
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,631
of these safe spaces.

329
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:38,713
Safe spaces that are safe for different people with different grief experiences.

330
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:39,394
So...

331
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:45,640
If you want to join this effort, I hope that this talk gave you a small idea of where to start.

332
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,141
Thank you very much.

333
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:50,364
Applause

334
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:01,974
I think there's time for some questions.

335
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:14,480
Interesting talk. When you were playtesting the game with people that had not had grief experiences, what was their reaction to the game? How did they connect with it?

336
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,362
It was kind of difficult to tell what a grief experience is and what isn't.

337
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:27,307
People who talked about other experiences rather than grief,

338
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:30,868
like we could not really see, of course, if someone who plays the game and

339
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:33,149
does not talk directly about their grief experience,

340
00:26:33,189 --> 00:26:35,910
we don't know whether they have a grief experience.

341
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,133
But there were people connected, for instance, the role of the flock.

342
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:47,476
to the ignorant role of society when something goes wrong,

343
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:49,217
you were kind of left alone.

344
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:52,158
So there were different interpretations.

345
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:54,820
I don't know if that answers your question, but...

346
00:26:59,222 --> 00:26:59,743
Is that... yeah?

347
00:27:00,437 --> 00:27:00,917
He said yes.

348
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:03,558
Good job.

349
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:06,779
So the exercise where we closed our eyes and imagined

350
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,361
the thought experiment that you guided us through, that

351
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:13,962
seemed like exactly the right exercise to kind of help

352
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:17,083
generate content for an experience like this.

353
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:19,084
Where did that exercise come from?

354
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:21,405
How did you know to use just that one?

355
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,846
That seemed like a magic sauce.

356
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,701
I came up with it.

357
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:31,783
And I felt also that, thanks for this question, because I think that especially when it comes

358
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:38,866
to these two images that we generate as a group, and if you have a group to inspire

359
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:43,128
your design constraints, it's useful to use a planet metaphor because it has something

360
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:44,268
in common with games.

361
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:49,030
It has a space, it has an atmosphere, planets have atmospheres, planets have rules.

362
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,330
So that was...

363
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:55,573
Quite a surprise for me also that that worked so well.

364
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:57,153
Cool, thank you.

365
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:13,839
Hi, when you were playing the game yourself, I know that obviously you were part of the design.

366
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,482
Did you have a similar experience to the other muses since you've been through losing a child yourself?

367
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:36,514
It differs. I have played it a couple of times and it's different every time.

368
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,440
Last time I played it, it was really touching to me.

369
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:45,333
At other times I felt it is too colorful for me.

370
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:47,834
I would maybe prefer something more dark.

371
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:53,796
But we wanted to sort of represent the taste of the muses.

372
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:59,658
Personally, I think that interpretations can change

373
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:03,400
depending on your current life situation.

374
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,901
As a player, you can also move into modes of where you like the game more and less.

375
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,062
Or where it makes more or less sense to you.

376
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:12,148
Thanks.

377
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:12,488
Thank you.

378
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:19,070
You said that you had the muses involved in the design process.

379
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,711
Was that something that was an ongoing thing

380
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,331
that you'd show them parts of it?

381
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,252
Or when they saw it for the first time,

382
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:30,633
was that without having seen any of the development?

383
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,359
We made them play it twice.

384
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:37,000
So first we gave them an early build,

385
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,122
and we actually wanted to include some of their ideas

386
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:44,844
or just also things like usability questions

387
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,746
and consider them in the final build.

388
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:52,188
So we did have a first round where we just observed

389
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,490
what worked and what didn't work in terms of usability

390
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,151
and whether the controls were clear or not.

391
00:29:56,931 --> 00:30:02,112
And then the final round, it was surprising that they had actually forgotten a lot of things.

392
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,113
So it was almost like a new game for them.

393
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:10,414
And yeah, that was quite a process, actually.

394
00:30:11,414 --> 00:30:17,015
Kind of a follow-up question was like, did you struggle with your input scheme

395
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:20,396
as far as working with people who are not used to normal game?

396
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,018
Is that all?

397
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:28,863
Like was it hard to develop a control scheme that was like legible for people who don't play games?

398
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,227
I guess. Yeah, I mean if I would do it again, I think I would use tablet

399
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:36,950
rather than the mouse controls, but all of them had

400
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:43,776
had a kind of basic office setup at home, so that that's where we went for.

401
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:50,142
It was clear that in the very first iteration,

402
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,483
so we had three iterations,

403
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:54,564
in the very first iteration we just casually used

404
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:57,505
keyboard controls and that didn't work at all

405
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,805
because that was too gamey.

406
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,146
That was not something that they would intuitively

407
00:31:04,126 --> 00:31:06,027
feel inclined to do.

408
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:08,748
So that's why we moved to something more simple.

409
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:10,948
Thank you.

410
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,400
I think that's it.

411
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:21,781
Is there another question?

412
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:24,402
Yeah.

413
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:33,786
So, oftentimes,

414
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,088
oftentimes, when there are

415
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:50,091
themes that people are especially hesitant to approach with art,

416
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:57,820
and especially with games which have a reputation for being a vulgar art, for better or for worse.

417
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,204
Those things are things that kind of exist in the realm of the highly personal or the

418
00:32:08,564 --> 00:32:17,349
highly sacred or the closely connected with a particular identity, which can be problematic

419
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:21,050
to speak for, I guess.

420
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:35,194
This is why I was so hesitant to ask, is because it's a half-formed question, but it's rooted in strong feelings.

421
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:45,378
Do you think that for especially those matters which feel important to talk about,

422
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:50,321
but fall well outside the realm of someone's experience,

423
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:56,984
that the muse approach is an effective way of...

424
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:01,825
approaching these heavy topics.

425
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:04,766
A resounding yes.

426
00:33:06,647 --> 00:33:10,248
Yes, it is a very clear answer because again

427
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:14,409
my experience is quite different

428
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:18,831
or the way I processed it was quite different from what the muses chose to

429
00:33:21,384 --> 00:33:28,047
images for their own experiences. So I felt like, did I have the chance to do this project again?

430
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:33,310
I would invite people who are very different from my own experience because I feel that

431
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,714
especially because you invite the muses as inspiration partners

432
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:42,657
and because you have this division of roles

433
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:45,119
between who creates and who inspires

434
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,721
and who is kind of constrained as an artist

435
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:52,385
and who is free as a dialogue partner.

436
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:54,066
It is very, very...

437
00:33:56,748 --> 00:33:57,069
you know...

438
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:05,141
useful to, or helpful to, to reach out to experiences that you don't, you yourself do

439
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:07,845
not have or cannot even start to understand.

440
00:34:07,925 --> 00:34:11,710
And I think news-based design is a good approach to starting that dialogue.

441
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:25,945
Okay so, if there's any questions coming up later,

442
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:29,768
I'm available for chats and I'm also available

443
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:32,670
in the wrap-up room if something comes up.

444
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,331
So, thank you so much for attending,

445
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:35,332
have a good conference.

446
00:34:35,352 --> 00:34:35,532
Thank you.
