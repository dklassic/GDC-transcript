00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:05,912
Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. If you are joining us from the East Coast or Europe,

2
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:10,835
my name is Brian Francis. I am a contributing editor at Gamasutra.com and community manager

3
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:18,300
for GDC. If you are watching us right now, thank you for joining us. You hopefully are familiar

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,342
with the game we have right here because it was just announced last Thursday at the Game Awards.

5
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:24,844
The game is Hades from Supergiant Games.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:34,071
It is available on the Epic Games Store in early access, which is a first for the company that made it, Supergiant Games.

7
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:39,255
With me in the lower left-hand corner of the screen is Greg Kasavin from that company.

8
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:40,036
Greg, how are you doing?

9
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:41,577
Doing great. How are you?

10
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:46,791
Good. As you can see, I am this is footage of me playing yesterday afternoon.

11
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:48,711
Unfortunately, we can't play live.

12
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:52,833
So if you're watching from home, feel free to mock my terrible gameplay.

13
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:55,594
Some of these some of these runs you're about to watch were not great.

14
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:56,994
Some of them were actually pretty good.

15
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:00,455
But what I'm actually very happy about and we'll get into this

16
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:03,376
is that all of them are actually very fruitful, even if they didn't go well.

17
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:05,997
Alex, you're here.

18
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:07,678
You're plunking away at something.

19
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:09,318
Who are you? Why are you here?

20
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,637
Hey, I'm Alex Rowe, an editor at GammaCitra.com.

21
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,119
I'm not quite sure why I'm here, other than I'm

22
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,220
excited about this game.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,282
Greg, will you tell me real quick, if you can,

24
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:20,383
why Early Access?

25
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:22,225
And how's that going for you?

26
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:23,906
I guess there's a weekend already,

27
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,447
but how is it going so far?

28
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:31,572
Yeah, the second part is faster to answer.

29
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,254
We've been really, really happy with how it's been going so far.

30
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:35,475
Thankfully, the

31
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:43,820
you know, even given the early access nature of the game, the initial like sort of, and it's a computer game as well, like the initial sort of

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,263
technical issues and technical challenges and so on were pretty minimal.

33
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:54,288
So everybody was for the most part able to get into the game and start playing. The response we've been getting,

34
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:56,089
we've been really really happy with.

35
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,033
I will never ever take for granted just like having

36
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:06,896
a group of our players just actually like the stuff that we work on, I will never take that

37
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:13,523
for granted. So every time we launch a game and our players say, hey this is cool, thank you for

38
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:19,508
making this, I'm like, I wipe the sweat off my brow and I breathe a sigh of relief and thankfully

39
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,890
That response has been really encouraging.

40
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:27,434
As for why early access, we conceived of that aspect of this game

41
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:30,796
like with kind of as part of the whole package right from the start.

42
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:35,079
It was a high priority when thinking about what we wanted to make next

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,081
after our last game, Pyre, came out last year.

44
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,903
We were really interested in a game that we could like...

45
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:47,166
kind of develop out in the open once it reached a certain point and make it the best game it could be

46
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:52,972
by gathering feedback along the way, by kind of building it in partnership with the community.

47
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:57,157
For us it opened up so many possibilities, not just

48
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:02,763
from like a from a game design perspective but also even from like a narrative perspective

49
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:08,730
like from my standpoint as as the writer on our games being able to work on a game whose story

50
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,656
could unfold kind of a little bit more serially instead of having to sort of put the entire thing

51
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,940
in beginning middle and end right in that initial launch so.

52
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:23,585
We think of this early access launch of Hades almost like a pilot episode of a series or something like that,

53
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:28,188
where it's a lot of the setup, you meet a lot of the characters and you figure out what the conflict is all about,

54
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:32,711
but the kind of resolution of the story is not all in the game yet.

55
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:38,114
And we'll roll out new characters and more events in the story over the course of the early access period,

56
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:41,717
along with just improving every other aspect of the game with any luck.

57
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:47,320
Right on. I'm going to really I'm going to do some housekeeping before we continue our interrogation.

58
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:55,362
Sorry, Greg. Folks in chat, we are taking your questions. We've already got folks asking about

59
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:59,803
what other platforms Hades will be launching on. Greg's addressed that elsewhere. And there's also

60
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:03,204
an FAQ that talks about the other platforms. We've dropped that in for you in chat.

61
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:13,709
Which brings us, but if you have questions, we especially want to keep them developer focused so that Greg can talk about how the how Supergiant brought this game to life.

62
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:16,671
Hopefully said if you're a game developer at home, you can learn yourself.

63
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:23,014
Greg, which talking about platforms means we want to talk about the Epic Store, I guess.

64
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:28,798
Would you walk us through, like the decision making behind going to the Epic Store?

65
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:33,200
And what was different about it compared to your past experiences with Steam and other platforms?

66
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:42,248
Yeah, so a lot of it does tie back to the early access nature of the game and that being really key to the whole design from our perspective.

67
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:53,531
So that meant that if we were going to develop this game out in the open for a while and we expect early access to last for more than a year on this game from our initial launch,

68
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:58,313
we need to be able to move on it really quickly.

69
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:00,473
So we knew we couldn't...

70
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,470
We knew for sure that we weren't going to launch early access

71
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,491
on a whole bunch of different platforms at the same time.

72
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,133
That would severely, that would basically make it

73
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:12,436
close to impossible for us to update the game

74
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,337
in a timely fashion.

75
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,000
So our team size is fewer than 20 people.

76
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:19,662
Maybe there are some teams out there

77
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:23,225
who can kind of, who are really effective

78
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:26,407
at patching games on many different platforms

79
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:27,248
all at the same time,

80
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,170
but that is not a skill set that we possess.

81
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:35,076
as a small team and we felt it was vital to be able to focus on a single version of the game

82
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:39,562
until we get the game to a really good state and then you know during that process we could start

83
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:45,329
to look at other platforms toward an eventual multi-platform launch so that's very much our plan.

84
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:55,277
So as we were working on Hades, we got in touch with the folks at Epic and started to learn about what they were working on with their store.

85
00:05:55,657 --> 00:06:04,804
And we became really excited for it. It just seemed like a really good fit given the experiment that we were making and the experiment that they were making.

86
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:08,367
Like one of the factors with Hades is we want this game to be

87
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:12,430
highly enjoyable to to watch as well as to play.

88
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,553
It's just a game designed around like immediacy and replayability among its

89
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:19,415
factors. You just kind of get in there and

90
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:22,937
hopefully start having fun with it and have a unique experience each time

91
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,180
and have the action be kind of very very readable

92
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,683
if a friend is next to you or you're streaming it or something

93
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,845
like that. And part of the thing with, part of Epic's

94
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:34,246
focus

95
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:38,807
just in general and I think with the store is to help

96
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:45,088
enable content creators like streamers and YouTube content creators to sort of like get a

97
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:50,109
Essentially get a piece of the action you've seen you you've seen the fortnight

98
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,110
Creators, what's it called? I think support a creator program

99
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,370
where

100
00:06:56,251 --> 00:07:00,291
where creators basically can just get compensated for their work and

101
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:03,932
I think streamers and YouTube content creators

102
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,676
have had such a significant and overall beneficial.

103
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:14,075
influence on games over the years that it's really only fair that they should

104
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:19,016
be able to benefit more from the incredibly hard work that they do so on

105
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:22,957
a personal level that spoke to me I think it spoke to other folks I work

106
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:29,619
with just as part of the the priority that that Epic was interested in but

107
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:32,980
anyway that that's all stuff that they probably speak to better than I can

108
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,061
those are just some of the reasons why it made sense to us to go sort of

109
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,241
conduct our early access

110
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:43,122
experiment off to the side because folks on other platforms who are familiar with

111
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:46,643
our games are used to our games being like a hundred percent complete. We've

112
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:51,564
said in the past that we really value the completeness of our games so folks

113
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:56,226
on other platforms one day will get the kind of experience that they are used to

114
00:07:56,286 --> 00:08:00,687
from us and on the same timeline as we've delivered our games on in the past

115
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:05,208
where you know typically they take Transistor and Pyre both took us about

116
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:07,248
three years to make so basically

117
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,335
along that we expect Hades will be done on roughly that same timeline.

118
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:17,523
So we figured if you're just if that's the experience you're accustomed to and the experience you want to have,

119
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:18,925
nothing has changed.

120
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:21,929
You'll you'll get to play our completed game

121
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,711
hopefully wherever.

122
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,073
in as many places as we can support and make sense of

123
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:31,193
once we're out of early access.

124
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:35,475
But for now, it made sense to us to run early access

125
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,736
on the Epic Games Store.

126
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,257
I hope that explanation seems reasonable.

127
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:40,298
No, totally.

128
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:42,699
And we have a bunch of good questions already in chat.

129
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,940
We'll get to them in a minute here.

130
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,801
Before we get off storefronts entirely.

131
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:52,078
I gotta ask, and we understand you don't speak for Supergiant as a whole, but just as a veteran developer yourself,

132
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:56,322
how do you feel about the proliferation of game storefronts in the latter half of this year,

133
00:08:56,342 --> 00:09:00,306
especially with Epic, obviously, and Discord, and a couple others?

134
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:05,090
Like, how are you feeling about the business that you're in?

135
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,232
Is it exciting times or confusing?

136
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:32,434
It is exciting times. I mean, I've been, yeah, as you as you may know, I've been around the, I've been around the block a couple of times because I used to, I used to work in the gaming press way back when, you know, since, so I've been, I've been, I reported on games for, you know, like 10 years or more than 10 years starting in the 90s. And now I've been in game development for more than 10 years. So I think if you've been around long enough, you know, this stuff kind of goes in cycles. And it's

137
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:36,687
And it's aligned often with the console cycles in particular,

138
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,528
like what happens in the computer game industry

139
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:42,029
is sort of there on the periphery of what's

140
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,551
going on in the console industry.

141
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:46,432
So new consoles are announced.

142
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:47,953
There's a ton of excitement.

143
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:54,796
But as consoles sort of grow old,

144
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:59,158
then PC platforms tend to take priority for a while,

145
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:01,080
and they kind of hopscotch each other.

146
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:07,543
over the years and the cycle keeps turning that way and new platforms rise, older platforms can fall.

147
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:10,258
That's always been the way of things.

148
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,821
So I think broadly that we're just kind of at that point

149
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,803
in the cycle when new platforms start to get announced.

150
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:20,606
And it's definitely an exciting time

151
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:24,989
because you can't help but wanna sort of start,

152
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,191
even if you're doing it only in your head,

153
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,833
you start to bet on whichever horses you think

154
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,494
are gonna win the race.

155
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:34,196
And you start to wonder who's got the right.

156
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:39,987
who's got the right angle on what's going on, who's going to sort of thrive and prevail through all

157
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:47,872
this, and who might fall by the wayside. But generally it's absolutely a good thing.

158
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:53,936
Like anybody investing in the game industry, creating more competition for the platforms

159
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:59,539
that are out there, it just makes things better for everybody when we have more

160
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,981
choices as game players. I think that's the bottom line.

161
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:07,584
Yeah, I think for me it's exciting stuff.

162
00:11:07,704 --> 00:11:09,345
As someone who's followed the industry for a while,

163
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,166
it's like, oh man, what's gonna happen?

164
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:15,228
I'm excited by the unknown in the game industry

165
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,669
and I think that's always been part of the appeal to it

166
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,151
for me that I, despite, you know,

167
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,732
despite how long I have been following it,

168
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,213
I cannot predict it.

169
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,455
Anyone who thinks that they could predict it,

170
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,636
I don't believe that person.

171
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,437
It takes many surprising twists and turns, I think,

172
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:32,638
like pretty frequently.

173
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,374
That's one of the truest things I've ever heard on this stream.

174
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:38,695
I'm going to springboard off of Spizzic's question.

175
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:42,016
You're launching into early access.

176
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,997
Early access has been a thing on Steam for a while.

177
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,098
PlayStation and Xbox have begun to support it.

178
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:50,119
The difference between Epic, the Epic Games Store and other platforms is that

179
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,381
it's supporting different forms of interactions between devs and players.

180
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,202
Could you break down, like, what that's meant for you as a team?

181
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:01,883
This player specifically, Spizzic, has questions about the lack of a forum.

182
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:05,924
But I do know that you guys have a Discord, because that was sort of the first thing that was part of the trailer.

183
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:10,525
So what was the difference in changing player communication for you guys?

184
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:15,166
Yeah, that's right. I mean, I think one of Epic's things is that it...

185
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:23,567
I think they very much want for the relationship between the developer and their player base to be as direct as possible.

186
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,208
And kind of not filter through them.

187
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,268
And it's also a new platform, right?

188
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,988
So it's not going to have, like...

189
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:42,369
It just doesn't have as many of the robust features yet as Steam has developed over what's it been, 15 or 20, like a long time?

190
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,849
Very long.

191
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,390
Half-Life 2 came out two times.

192
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,251
I almost said too long, and the before times.

193
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,391
Yeah, so, um...

194
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,790
But yeah, you know, in our case, the response, the onus is on us.

195
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,152
And it's been we have our we've actually been

196
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,853
we launched our official discord server earlier this year.

197
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,014
Somewhat quietly.

198
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:01,495
We've been building it up a little bit over the months.

199
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:05,237
Now, you know, now I think players who look back at that decision,

200
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,358
it may make a little bit more sense to them.

201
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:11,060
But we've we've never like for our part, we've never had

202
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,961
our player community in a central location

203
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:16,783
because because there are like.

204
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:22,227
forums and other pockets of community you know in in different places on the

205
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:26,110
internet or whatnot so launching our official discord is for us

206
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,591
is a place where we you know we finally have our own

207
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:32,134
kind of homegrown community there and if you play the game you'll see

208
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:35,476
it's kind of right there linked in the main menu as a means to

209
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:38,518
get in there and talk to other players or talk to us

210
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,060
share feedback so

211
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,123
I think we thought about having like a forum and stuff as well

212
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:52,786
But we we liked the vibe that discord provides and we already had enough of like a groundswell

213
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,288
Of players there. I mean there's other stuff like

214
00:13:57,035 --> 00:14:01,518
I've seen folks point out it's like, oh, there are no user reviews on the Epic Games Store.

215
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:05,781
I'm sure I can imagine something like that might be added at some point.

216
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:12,284
We're an early access game. I think we're, of course, very open to folks reviewing it,

217
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:13,865
because we charge the same $20 that

218
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,207
a non-early access game might charge.

219
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,888
So we stand by the quality of our game and so on.

220
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:23,890
But if you want to find reviews and opinions on the game,

221
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,271
yeah, you'll have to look elsewhere

222
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,532
besides the actual storefront.

223
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:30,374
But I think, personally, I think it's not difficult

224
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,915
to find opinions about products on the internet.

225
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:36,176
if you have to turn elsewhere.

226
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:39,296
But so overall, I don't have a ton of opinions

227
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,557
about like the direct feature comparison

228
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:44,297
of the Epic Games Store versus other platforms.

229
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:48,618
We felt it was a good fit for what we were trying to do,

230
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,859
but as with all aspects of the game,

231
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,959
if that's something that players have feedback about,

232
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,239
I'm sure we'll be hearing about it

233
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,580
as will the team at Epic, no doubt.

234
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,620
Mm, yeah, I am.

235
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:03,144
There's a good question here in chat I want to get to before I forget.

236
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:04,165
It's from Miss Jim Cloud.

237
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:05,626
And they want to know, what was the vision you

238
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,607
had when you first came up with the concept for Hades?

239
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:12,409
What is the sort of driving goal here sort of as a game?

240
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,911
Like, was the goal to, beyond wanting to get early access,

241
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:19,373
was it just to make a game that had been on someone's mind for ages?

242
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:22,875
Or was there a specific thing you were trying to pull off with this game?

243
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:23,515
Yeah.

244
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:28,725
Yeah, the vision, I started smiling because it doesn't it

245
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:35,668
doesn't quite work that way around here. But but the in my

246
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:42,911
role, really, I'm one of the people who helps formulate the

247
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:48,694
ideas that we then pursue. And one of the things I look for as

248
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,455
as the highest priority is like, what

249
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,073
What is the overlap of preoccupations on the team?

250
00:15:56,633 --> 00:16:01,618
What do the most people here want to make the most passionately?

251
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:03,279
And that's the game that we should make.

252
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,804
So we started having, very soon after Pyre launched, like within a month,

253
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:12,487
that game spent three years in development.

254
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:13,488
We were already eager to...

255
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:16,489
go on and figure out what our next thing was going to be.

256
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:19,951
So we started having many, many hours of conversations.

257
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:22,992
And some themes started to emerge from that.

258
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:25,794
And one of the ideas I already spoke to

259
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:30,577
is wanting to develop a concept that we could continue

260
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:32,498
to build on after it was out there,

261
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:36,120
a game idea that was extensible and not

262
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,501
just like a kind of a one and done game

263
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,062
similar to our last three games.

264
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:42,263
So that was a high priority for us.

265
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:46,670
And we were very intrigued by a design around replayability,

266
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,751
kind of for lack of a better term,

267
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,633
like a more modern design sensibility

268
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,494
than maybe some of our previous games

269
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,855
that are just like kind of have a more linear

270
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:57,256
campaign structure.

271
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,878
You finish them, hopefully they'll stick with you,

272
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,699
you know, forever on an emotional level,

273
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,680
but they're not necessarily games designed

274
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,021
to be replayed many, many times.

275
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:10,265
we were really drawn to making a game that felt very immediate, that you could

276
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:14,669
pick up and play in short stretches or play, you know, kind of for as long as you wanted

277
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,914
and still have a compelling experience around that. And then we started thinking about what theme

278
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:26,400
would align well with that. We thought about, you know, do we want to revisit one of the worlds

279
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,985
that we've created in the past because we love those worlds and that's, you know, stuff that's like

280
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:38,559
we while we've never returned to one of our past games, it's not something that we are like morally opposed to or anything like that.

281
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:43,021
We just, you know, don't want to do it unless the time and circumstances are right.

282
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,503
And and given given our other priorities.

283
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:54,045
It felt like once again, let's let's make something new. Let's make something that really really fits this set of design goals

284
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:57,007
and and we looked to

285
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,950
Greek mythology in this case as a source as

286
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,654
In one in one sense a well-worn theme for video games

287
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:07,436
but in another sense something that we felt was

288
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:13,961
Both a perfect fit for what we were doing and also in some ways like really under explored in certain

289
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:24,948
in certain respects, particularly our angle, we think, on the... I was, as the person doing the writing, I was very drawn to a particular

290
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:32,352
angle on Greek mythology that I feel is very true to the source material,

291
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:40,497
yet is often sort of lost in the shuffle of how this type of material tends to be adapted, which is.

292
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:46,483
the gods are a big dysfunctional family that we can see ourselves in.

293
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:53,656
They're, you know, I think part of the reason these characters have survived for thousands of years is because

294
00:18:54,495 --> 00:19:01,878
they relate so strongly to so many people and they relate not because they're gods,

295
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:07,040
but because they're human. So we wanted to explore some of that. It felt like a really flavorful,

296
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:13,262
it felt rich with potential for us. So yeah, we started.

297
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:19,936
We started making it. So that's a long answer, but yeah, you know, I have a more like we wanted to make a roguelike

298
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:24,743
Dungeon crawler where you defy the god of death, you know, it felt exciting to us

299
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:29,591
Uh to to figure out what that game was going to look like. We love playing roguelikes. Um

300
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:34,089
We've been really inspired by some of the early access successes over the years.

301
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:38,693
These games like Darkest Dungeon and Slay the Spire and Dead Cells.

302
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:43,497
Games that started off really strong, like from the moment you dropped your,

303
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:47,260
you know, $20 on them, that was like money super well spent.

304
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,322
And then they only got better and better from there.

305
00:19:49,382 --> 00:19:53,386
So we're like, oh, man, what if we could what if we could pull off something like that?

306
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:56,889
That's kind of what in our minds, I felt like the right way to do it.

307
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:57,549
And we felt that.

308
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,553
if we knew it's going to be early access from the start,

309
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:04,775
rather than doing it as kind of like,

310
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,976
oh, God, we ran out of time,

311
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:07,117
let's put it in early access.

312
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,279
If we plan for it to be early access,

313
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:10,640
maybe that improves our chances

314
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,961
of handling that kind of process properly.

315
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:18,143
Yeah, look man, this is video games. No one's going to get mad at you for making a roguelite dungeon crawler.

316
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:25,689
Um, I want to make games that feel that feel fresh also like I really value

317
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:31,653
games that feel like they have kind of a reason for for being like that just don't feel like

318
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:33,895
um, they're you know, just

319
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:39,059
kind of the same as other games that are out there, but I I think what we've made has

320
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:45,581
Has plenty of our you know, dirty signature all over it and has it has our has our particular

321
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:52,925
Marks on it to make it feel distinct. It has Jen. This is Gen Z's really good art all over it. Yeah

322
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:55,867
She I

323
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:58,908
think she is one of the I

324
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:02,870
Don't know. Hopefully she's not watching this, but I think Gen Z is one of the greatest artists

325
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:11,002
working in the industry. It's a huge honor to be working with her. She kind of reinvents her style on every single game we've

326
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:19,812
worked on. She's of course just one member of our art team though she does create the the the overall sense of style and the

327
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:23,356
look and does all our wonderful character designs and everything. So I think.

328
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:29,430
Her work, the work of Darren Korb, our audio director who does all our music and contributes

329
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,612
key voices to this game and all the sound effects.

330
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:39,697
He is a man of many talents and his work has, of course, really helped our games always

331
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,620
stand out over the years and I think this game is no exception.

332
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,241
So it's always exciting to see.

333
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:48,745
what my colleagues will do on each new game.

334
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,567
And that's, I think for us, it's been part of the fun

335
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:53,390
of kind of choosing a different theme

336
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,492
and setting every single time.

337
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:02,618
I'm gonna springboard off of Vogir's question in chat.

338
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:08,700
Vogir sort of was asking about is this a roguelike, and I think you just sort of answered it by comparing it to those other games.

339
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,922
Vogir's asking about the depth of and comparing it, asking if it's comparable to Binding of Isaac and for the Gungeon.

340
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:21,283
I would like to ask you, how does Supergiant Games define depth?

341
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,383
And in kind of a like

342
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:27,847
How did you sort of build yourself a template for the layer?

343
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,349
Like we're sort of looking at some of the systems right now that you guys used with the mirror.

344
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,374
How did you look at your design experience and say, this is how we can make depth that

345
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:42,378
will update that we can both like layer with what we ship first and then update over time

346
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,720
in kind of the way that Vogir is talking about?

347
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:51,485
Yeah, so depth in games, I think works on many vectors.

348
00:22:53,962 --> 00:23:00,365
So we aspire to having gameplay depth and we aspire to having narrative depth as well.

349
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:05,807
And hopefully the two together create an overall very rich feeling experience.

350
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:10,129
But I think you're referring more to gameplay depth, so let me speak to that.

351
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:12,850
I think we look for...

352
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:18,712
We really, really value in each of our designs for our past games...

353
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:25,985
the sense that you can kind of discover different successful play styles as you go.

354
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:32,567
So we really favor designs that let you experiment, that give you sort of the latitude to

355
00:23:32,607 --> 00:23:38,768
experiment, that encourage you to try different things and kind of experiment with different tools

356
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:43,950
within the context of the gameplay. And then, you know, just when you find what feels like a

357
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,790
perfect combination, like a kind of a very effective...

358
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:54,174
set of skills and tools and abilities and so on, maybe you get nudged into a new set of tools and abilities that

359
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:58,437
is even better or maybe just different in an intriguing way.

360
00:23:58,777 --> 00:24:03,680
So I think if you look to each of our previous games, they've all done some version of that.

361
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,203
But in the case of Hades, I think it like really synthesizes a lot of what we've

362
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:13,428
a lot of, I think, our best ideas from our previous games.

363
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,333
In Bastion, there was this goal around immediacy,

364
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:21,237
like it's a game with very little preamble, you just pick it up and start playing.

365
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:27,825
And we wanted you to get right in there with Hades and just immediately get, just...

366
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:33,090
figure the gameplay out like a very low accessibility barrier,

367
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,033
but at the same time it merges together an aspect of Transistor that was very

368
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:41,536
exciting, which was this idea of combining different

369
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:45,059
abilities, making for thousands of different possible combinations, and

370
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:48,661
that's very much at play in Hades here, where you have

371
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,743
the Olympian gods essentially provide you with

372
00:24:52,344 --> 00:24:54,065
different blessings, kind of like power-ups.

373
00:24:54,497 --> 00:25:00,379
that you can't necessarily control which of these gods you encounter, but you can choose between the

374
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,100
blessings they provide. So each time you play, you're sort of like building out your character

375
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,741
in a unique way. So sometimes you'll be able to play and kind of go down a specific path that you

376
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:15,763
really want, like, oh, you're using the bow and you know that Poseidon happens to cause enemies

377
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:18,383
to get knocked back away from you, and that forms a very powerful...

378
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,125
combination that you could use, but other times you know you're not going to be

379
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:26,847
presented with exactly the options that maybe you were hoping for and you'll

380
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:31,888
have to make do, and that also I think feels true to work we did in

381
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:35,590
Transistor and Pyre, where it's about kind of like making the most of a

382
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,532
situation that you can't entirely control in some cases. So we find that

383
00:25:41,132 --> 00:25:43,213
that makes for that kind of...

384
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:51,760
that kind of structure can make for gameplay that continues to be surprising and interesting

385
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:59,003
over time and just defining enough overlapping systems that can interact with each other to

386
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:05,106
where you know suddenly richness emerges from the play experience and in our own play testing we

387
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:11,148
find that we're not having the same experience over and over we're compelled to start new runs

388
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:13,950
that's all stuff we really really look for

389
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:19,326
Nice. I cannot think about the fact, a question or two ago,

390
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:22,728
you didn't say it out loud, but you were talking about moving to early access,

391
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:28,170
and you almost sounded relieved, this idea of not having to wait three games,

392
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,472
three years to put out a game, sort of get it out quickly, get it, start iterating on it.

393
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,114
By that math, three games is nine years, Alex.

394
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:40,516
Yeah, exactly. So, I wonder, how has your process changed internally,

395
00:26:40,556 --> 00:26:44,518
both for you specifically and I think you deserve on the team, working on a game like this where

396
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:47,734
you've sort of got to be ready to go pretty early,

397
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,137
as opposed to having the luxury of three years

398
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,819
to crunch on a masterwork or something.

399
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,162
So tell me, how has your process changed practically

400
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:56,603
as a writer and developer?

401
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,345
Yeah, it's a really good question.

402
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:01,167
Our process has changed a lot in anticipation of this.

403
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:04,230
And again, it all ties back to, I

404
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:06,533
guess I didn't say this specifically,

405
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:09,015
but a really key aspect of this whole game for us

406
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:09,716
has been that we've.

407
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,452
We've just planned it more in general.

408
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:16,975
And part of it is anticipating an early access launch

409
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,856
and sort of, I almost equate it,

410
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:23,299
I hope this doesn't sound too obnoxious as an analogy,

411
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:26,081
but it's like, it almost felt like training for a marathon

412
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:26,881
or something like that,

413
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:30,884
where we've basically moved internally

414
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:33,846
to a monthly milestone cadence.

415
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:35,026
So every month.

416
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:43,922
we have a milestone where we have certain goals and the month is divided up into certain phases.

417
00:27:44,282 --> 00:27:50,146
So we have, at the beginning of a milestone is when we could make more major changes to the code

418
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:56,190
and so on, and then we lock the code down, we could still make data changes, so fine-tune things.

419
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,233
You know, from my standpoint, I could still be adding new narrative events or changing

420
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:07,401
the voiceover and stuff like that, because that's all part of a data-driven system, and it's not like

421
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:13,569
fundamentally, you know, altering the code by me adding or subtracting events. And then

422
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,956
toward the end of the milestone, we're then, you know, testing, bug fixing,

423
00:28:19,757 --> 00:28:22,979
polishing, making final changes to get everything ready.

424
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,081
And then at the end of that, we play test

425
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,482
and then we kind of do it over.

426
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:29,163
So we've been doing it, we've been working this way

427
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:33,106
for a number of months now, knowing that basically

428
00:28:33,206 --> 00:28:34,267
once this game is out there,

429
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:35,688
we're just gonna keep doing that.

430
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:39,050
And those major updates become major updates

431
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,451
that we're like committed, you know,

432
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:41,632
we're committing ourselves to.

433
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,374
If you quit out to the main menu,

434
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:47,356
you'll see right there, like on the main menu that it says.

435
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:53,839
when our next major update is coming, that basically is aligned with our internal milestones and when

436
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,983
we think we'll have a whole batch of, from our perspective, cool new stuff ready to go.

437
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:09,547
So that really has been the biggest shift in our internal development, whereas with a three-year

438
00:29:09,607 --> 00:29:09,987
project...

439
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:16,135
our milestones at this point in the process would be much longer, would probably span,

440
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:22,158
you know, two and a half or three months and be somewhat more nebulous in nature, I would say.

441
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:27,200
So it's a more, I think in a word, it's a more disciplined approach that we're taking,

442
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,842
but we've always valued planning and production discipline at Supergiant.

443
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:34,943
I think it's been key to our success that we've been able to just

444
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:40,005
You've heard from many developers, I'm sure, that finishing a project is really hard.

445
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:49,212
It's really hard to decide it's time to wrap it up and to make those really tough choices about finishing your game.

446
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:50,513
So it kind of...

447
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:57,411
We've learned a lot about that over nearly 10 years that we've been working together as a team.

448
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:05,480
And so this project sort of puts that forward. And of course, it's a little scary to commit to

449
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,305
major updates on a regular basis, but we've been practicing at it. We think we could do it,

450
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,768
obviously. Nice. Cool.

451
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,675
Alex, can I slide in with some folks from chat?

452
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:21,501
No, absolutely not. No, I was going to just keep talking. I was going to just

453
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,464
please. No, please. By all means, go ahead.

454
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:29,253
Roger. We can we can sort of step back to your good old creative director stuff.

455
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:36,924
Greg, the Lord Gersh would like to talk about the themes of death and rebirth that have showed up in all of your games.

456
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:44,215
Hades is literally about death and rebirth, as you have seen on this stream, where I die repeatedly and then get reborn and die again.

457
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:52,602
What other outside influences, like you talked about why you landed on Greek mythology earlier,

458
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:58,486
but what have you looked at in the real world to make you think about telling stories around death and rebirth like that?

459
00:30:58,546 --> 00:31:00,228
That's what Lord Gersh would like to know.

460
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:04,010
Yeah, I mean, that's an interesting question.

461
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:12,537
I mean, I think it's really tough to, it's tough for me to pin down because it's my entire,

462
00:31:13,978 --> 00:31:21,596
It's like it's got to be my entire outlook on I seek to work on stories that that that feel

463
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:27,807
that feel meaningful to me and I think that's the only chance I have of those

464
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:29,608
stories connecting with other people out there.

465
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:33,670
So there has to be something there that that I feel

466
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,673
is true and that I can spend a whole lot of time just trying to

467
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,795
dig for to uncover. Like if it's something with just a

468
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:46,477
simple answer, like a simple moral, to me that's not sufficient

469
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,779
for a story because there's just not a lot there.

470
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:52,620
But in this game's case, you know...

471
00:31:53,436 --> 00:32:02,385
I don't know that death, I wouldn't, death and rebirth for sure, I can see how that would be construed as like a recurring theme through our games.

472
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:03,546
Mm-hmm.

473
00:32:03,646 --> 00:32:06,809
But Hades, to me, is a game about family.

474
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,772
and I look to my own family experience

475
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:16,214
and the family experiences of other people I know

476
00:32:16,314 --> 00:32:17,614
and other people I've heard about.

477
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:20,856
And of course, the family experiences described

478
00:32:21,636 --> 00:32:25,358
in the world of Greek myth as one of the kind of most

479
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:29,159
fundamental sources of inspiration for the kind of stories

480
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:30,680
that this game will have.

481
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,980
Of course, that sounds maybe,

482
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:41,012
I don't know how openly I would admit that outside of like a GDC live stream, because

483
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:47,257
of course we want it to be, it's like an exciting hack and slash experience on the face of it.

484
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:51,840
But our games, I think if you know, if you're familiar with our games, you know that our

485
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,582
stories are always about something more than what's there on the surface.

486
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:57,744
I think it's pretty clear.

487
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:03,689
pretty early on when you, you know, meet Cerberus or whatever, uh, as like an old family dog

488
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:09,575
that you know that this is kind of like a, um, there's, there's a bit of a family drama

489
00:33:09,715 --> 00:33:15,281
or a family comedy, I should say, uh, underneath the surface of this game. Um, but I mean,

490
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,824
I, I can't, I can't tell you.

491
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:24,525
I can never answer like what are my inspirations. It's just too many things. I play a lot of video

492
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:29,627
games. I try to read. I try to watch movies. I listen to a lot of music. Like I don't know.

493
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:34,549
I'm the sum total of all the experiences I've ever had and that informs my work.

494
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:37,261
Right on.

495
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:41,244
Well, I would love to know sort of how your work has changed

496
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:43,225
in the last couple of years as your team.

497
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:44,666
Well, actually, I don't even know.

498
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:45,666
So there's a question here in chat

499
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:47,507
that has to do with team size and bringing new folks in.

500
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,768
Can you talk a little bit about how

501
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,590
Supergiant has changed since you've been there,

502
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,811
and specifically since Pyre launched last time we talked?

503
00:33:54,244 --> 00:34:01,029
Yeah, so I think one of the things we're really proud of at Supergiant is all seven of the folks

504
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:06,833
who created Bastion together, we're all still here working. We've worked on each respective

505
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:12,798
game in our same relative roles, so that's, I mentioned Jen and Darren and it's myself,

506
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:18,782
Amir who's our studio director and essentially like our design lead, and Gavin and Andrew.

507
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:27,707
Who are our engineers and then Logan Cunningham who's provided a major voice or more more than one in each of our games?

508
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:34,892
So each of us has continued to work together and since pyre we've been so I should say after bastion

509
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:42,118
We were we grew from 7 to 12 people and we were joined our art department expanded

510
00:34:42,793 --> 00:34:45,295
with Camilo Vanegas and Josh Barnett.

511
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:52,041
And basically we have more of a support team

512
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:53,242
and a business development team

513
00:34:53,562 --> 00:34:54,863
and folks like Michael Aleshai

514
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:57,565
who just handles so much of our day-to-day operations

515
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:58,066
at this point.

516
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:05,750
So we became more of like a complete team after Bastion, but we stayed at that number 12 for many, many years.

517
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:09,892
And that only changed after Pyre last year.

518
00:35:10,272 --> 00:35:16,735
We realized, given our plans for Hades, that we needed...

519
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:17,296
It was time...

520
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:24,723
for us to grow a little bit and to shore up what we felt were like essentially some of our weaknesses at that point.

521
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:36,557
And so we have more design muscle now, we have more art muscle, and we've grown from that number 12 to closer to 20 at this point.

522
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:38,519
That's the size that we're going to stick to.

523
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:50,415
Because we think that being small is like really fundamental to how we operate or like I mean who knows who knows that the future holds but we all know for certain that if we

524
00:35:52,696 --> 00:36:00,178
we like we couldn't even this this this space that you see we fit everyone into this room like this is our space if we

525
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,560
We just don't even have room for more people. So we want to rather constrain

526
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,942
Our ideas to what we can achieve with this team here than just like have the mindset of growing bigger and bigger

527
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:14,864
Um, because we think that a lot of our best ideas are really only possible

528
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,884
because of our small team size.

529
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:19,865
It's just how we work and how we sort of negotiate

530
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:23,206
through creative ideas as well.

531
00:36:23,646 --> 00:36:28,627
So that's been a big and really exciting change

532
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:34,268
over the last year to like have new blood on the team

533
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:37,909
and see how much of an incredible impact

534
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,329
these folks have had across the board.

535
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:43,670
And you'll see them, their names are all in.

536
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:47,573
in the credits in Hades and and they're all on our team page and everything you

537
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:50,096
can find out more about everyone who works at the studio that

538
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:55,161
way. Nice so that's a good opener for Alitishan's question which is I don't

539
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:57,484
know if they're a developer or a fan but they want to know what's it like taking

540
00:36:57,504 --> 00:37:01,188
all these new people into the team versus starting with a very small team

541
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:04,671
and passion. So how is the vibe in the

542
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:05,913
studio workflow changed?

543
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,141
now that you've bumped up to 20.

544
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,663
Has it been a noticeable thing or does it just feel...

545
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,424
Yeah, it's noticeable for sure.

546
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:13,565
I mean, one of the things,

547
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:16,547
one of the reasons we approached the process

548
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,668
of expanding the team like really

549
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:23,711
with a great deal of caution and hopefully care

550
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:26,192
is that we know that even if you bring in

551
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:32,854
the most talented person in the world, like the absolute best artist or the absolute game designer,

552
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:38,595
the best game designer in the whole world joins your team. It still can have a profound, it can

553
00:37:38,695 --> 00:37:46,058
and will have a profound effect on the culture of the team. And that has to be approached

554
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:52,520
carefully, like you have to look for, or I don't mean to be prescriptive. In our case,

555
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,420
it was really important.

556
00:37:54,170 --> 00:38:02,774
to bring people on board who enhanced our culture, who contributed something more than just their work.

557
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:08,777
Because they, like, it just, each new person who joins changes all of the social dynamics here.

558
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,278
So we're aware of that. And so we just...

559
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:14,880
try to do our best to make the right choices, right?

560
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,482
And thankfully, those choices have worked out really, really well.

561
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:24,725
And the reality is that we have new blood on the team and folks who are, you know,

562
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:28,707
more bright-eyed and bushy-tailed than people like me who've been, you know, whatever,

563
00:38:28,787 --> 00:38:30,948
been doing this stuff for a long time.

564
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,630
I'm—it invigorates the rest of us, right?

565
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,330
Like, when done properly.

566
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,492
So that's—thankfully, that's how it's worked out.

567
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:39,773
And we've always, like—

568
00:38:40,532 --> 00:38:46,457
in the past prior to some of these folks joining, we've actually been pretty, the word monastic has

569
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:53,222
been used to describe us. We're just kind of plunk our headphones on and work away and then leave at

570
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:59,107
the end of the day. Like I think, I think folks out there may imagine us to be this like, this

571
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:03,531
group of people we all, you know, hang out and have beers after work. It's like we're not, we're

572
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,675
not really like that usually. We're pretty focused on

573
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:13,345
on our work and a lot of us have lives outside of work and we really value that separation.

574
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:17,788
So at the end of the day, people go home and go to the rest of their lives.

575
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:22,832
So it's been really helpful to have new folks on the team who have like livened things up

576
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:27,575
and you know, more people going out to lunch and larger groups and that sort of thing that's

577
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,196
just made.

578
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:31,860
made things more lively than they have been in the past.

579
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,064
And I think the proof is in the pudding as far as the actual work,

580
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:41,069
because we've been working, you know, Pyre launched in late July,

581
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,033
and now we have this game in December.

582
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,596
And I think that some folks have expressed...

583
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:54,305
Surprise or like have you been working on this like all this time? No, we didn't we didn't get started on Hades until after we were

584
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:58,630
Well finished with pyre. So we just it's only been possible because

585
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:01,314
We're bigger now than we were

586
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:02,615
nice

587
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:11,214
Yeah, that is a good follow up here from Twindim wants to know, sort of what are the core values of your workplace culture? That's like a kind of a

588
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:17,918
man, shout out to chat for being really interested in like, just like life, quality of life and game dev. Thank you, guys.

589
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:31,405
Good questions. Thank you. You know, those are those are questions that we are very interested in as well. And in fact, so so here, I hope I can rattle these off off the top of my head. So we, an interesting thing about us

590
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:35,476
May be interesting for you to decide we did not have

591
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:37,117
stated values

592
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,460
as a studio until

593
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:43,504
Last year and we've been around since 2009

594
00:40:45,185 --> 00:40:48,969
So we didn't do that because we were like dismissive of it. It's just because

595
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:54,768
I think it took us all that time to truly understand what our values were,

596
00:40:55,008 --> 00:41:01,831
and to have some really frank conversations about it, and seeking alignment around it.

597
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:10,894
So, one of our values, for instance, is we iterate on everything.

598
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:13,255
That's a core part of how we make games.

599
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:17,257
An iterative development process is just...

600
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:24,023
how we do it and and it's important for everyone here to embrace that and and to like understand

601
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:31,568
that that re-evaluation and criticism and feedback is is is part of the process and and that mindset

602
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,793
is part of what enables us to I think go into an early access launch I think with a hopefully

603
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:45,158
with a healthy mindset we also say that that work our work is not

604
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:51,639
our lives are not in competition with our work, that our work contours to our lives.

605
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,982
So that's our view on how to manage a work-life balance.

606
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,584
So here we have, as a small team, we

607
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:04,796
we have flexible, like we would rather work around the challenges of people

608
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:09,499
having flexible hours and working remotely, you know, coordinating remote

609
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,123
meetings and stuff like that than requiring everyone to strictly be here

610
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:17,525
always at the same place at the same time. We would rather enable everyone

611
00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:22,228
individually to to to position themselves to do their best work.

612
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:28,271
and to find the balance that works the best for them while knowing that their colleagues are there

613
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:36,454
to support them through that decision making and that we expect for people to be honest with

614
00:42:36,494 --> 00:42:44,636
themselves around it and the team is always reciprocal around that as well. So like around

615
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:50,238
here when someone, people are responsible for their own work here and their own kind of

616
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:58,449
what like uh for example on on on the writing or something like that it's like

617
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:00,234
no one's gonna tell me

618
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:05,429
No one's going to like assign a bunch of writing to me or something like that. Like I'm responsible

619
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:12,673
for my own work, but that is a big responsibility where we are all actively involved in our own

620
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:18,556
scheduling and knowing the value of making sure that everyone has a life outside of work. We

621
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:24,439
schedule accordingly and try to schedule like very, very conservatively to make sure that

622
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:27,240
there's time for everyone to iterate and to do their best work.

623
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:30,259
and to not feel like they're just totally under the gun.

624
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:34,603
And again, it's taken us a long time working together

625
00:43:34,703 --> 00:43:37,926
to figure out what is a good balance there.

626
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,247
I think that's always a challenge

627
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:42,770
for different developers to sort that out for themselves

628
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,371
and in general.

629
00:43:44,612 --> 00:43:46,153
So those are a couple of our...

630
00:43:48,774 --> 00:43:53,737
that that's giving you an impression of what some of our values are. But yeah, at this point, we have,

631
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:59,482
you know, they're not values that we like publicly print on our website, but that's part of them

632
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:03,565
being true to us. They're not like they're to they're not there as an advertisement for us.

633
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:10,029
They're just how we have grown to understand ourselves and and understand our relationship

634
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:12,911
to our work and to each other. And yeah, I mean, yeah, well.

635
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:19,263
That's great, and forgive me for this nebulous question, but I think it's something that people think about when they talk about things like mission statements or values.

636
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:23,385
Did codifying and making those explicit meaningfully change anything about the workplace?

637
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:27,907
Like, did it make it easier or simpler? Did it speed up meetings? Like, what did it do, if anything?

638
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:32,829
It really, in our case, it was really valuable. For me, personally, it was really valuable.

639
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,030
Like, the stuff I just talked about, of work contouring to your life, it really...

640
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:48,721
my own personal mindset toward my relationship with my work and just like how understanding

641
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:54,707
that it's not one size fits all was something that for me just like clicked once we did

642
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:56,008
put that.

643
00:44:57,146 --> 00:44:59,107
put that particular statement into words.

644
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:03,410
It's a phrase that Amir, our studio director, put into words,

645
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:08,152
you know, having spoken to me and others about where everybody was at with respect to their work.

646
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:11,674
It's like, what's the pattern here? What are our expectations?

647
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:13,215
Are we asking everyone to just...

648
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:18,878
slave away, you know, we're a small team should we just slave away constantly forever? Well no,

649
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:23,961
we can't do that because sustainability is our goal. We've been together for close to 10 years

650
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:28,223
and we want to keep going. If we just burn the candle at both ends forever, we're not going to

651
00:45:28,243 --> 00:45:35,447
make it. So how do we find the balance of making high quality games that we can be proud of while

652
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:39,890
still living our lives, you know, and because the rest of our lives

653
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:44,695
like empowers our ability to make the kind of game we make.

654
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,736
He asked about my inspirations before.

655
00:45:47,216 --> 00:45:49,457
My inspiration ain't gonna be just like crunching

656
00:45:49,557 --> 00:45:50,958
on my last project, you know?

657
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:54,479
Like that's not gonna make for a very interesting

658
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,140
video game over time and it's not gonna make

659
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,241
for a lot of content variety.

660
00:45:59,621 --> 00:46:01,902
So it's really important for us.

661
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:07,264
as a group of people doing creative work to find an appropriate balance.

662
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:11,526
We all care a lot about our work. We love doing the work, so

663
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:15,148
I think one of the challenges in the game industry can be

664
00:46:15,788 --> 00:46:19,490
for people to even just like pull themselves away from work, know when to

665
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,051
do that, but that's where I think a lot of our

666
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:27,513
experience over the years comes in. As a team, we all try to

667
00:46:27,573 --> 00:46:29,875
support each other, catch each other when

668
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,260
You know, we made a whole game about this.

669
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:33,801
It's called Pyre.

670
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:39,225
It's about a group of people who have to support each other

671
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:41,647
through thick and thin, come what may.

672
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:45,670
So yeah, I think we've learned a lot.

673
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:51,194
And I hope it's expressed through this game

674
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:51,995
that we're working on now.

675
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:56,352
Yeah, Pyro is an incredible game. Sorry, go ahead Brian.

676
00:46:56,472 --> 00:46:58,915
That was a really intricate answer.

677
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:02,899
Folks in chat, we're going to wrap up in about 10 minutes,

678
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:04,340
so feel free to get your questions in.

679
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,602
I do want to get you answers for those questions.

680
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,721
So we're going to sneak one in before I want to loop right back to the discussion point we're on.

681
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:19,363
There are folks asking about like Kittagine and others who are asking about content after the 1.0 launch.

682
00:47:19,843 --> 00:47:25,225
Greg, do you know if there'll be continued content updates like there are in early access?

683
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:31,946
Or you said earlier, you know, once the products launch, it'll be the equivalent of a three year baked super giant game from before.

684
00:47:34,147 --> 00:47:40,791
So we've always done like our our kind of game launches have never been the end of either

685
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:47,815
project so I think I think it's fair to expect that we will continue to I mean it's all but

686
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:54,259
certain I would say to the extent that we are able we will continue to support this game for as long as

687
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:55,700
as players

688
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:59,370
have interest in it, that's something we've always done with each of our games.

689
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:08,117
So I think since we do expect early access to last for more than a year, we were reluctant

690
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:13,482
to make a ton of promises about what will happen after we say it's reached the 1.0 phase.

691
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:19,146
But I think our goal for sure is if players are still enjoying the game, we'll want to

692
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,268
keep supporting it in the ways that make.

693
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,822
in the ways that make sense.

694
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:27,390
And at that point, we would expect it to be available

695
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:31,337
in more places and be positioned to be able to support it

696
00:48:31,357 --> 00:48:32,560
in wherever it appears.

697
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,254
I'll just do another quick last call for questions so we can try and get them in.

698
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:42,577
Greg, yeah, like I said, I wanted to loop back on that thread about studio life.

699
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,680
This has been an interesting year to talk about that.

700
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,484
I've been trying to do my due diligence and ask whenever I can talk to team leaders whenever

701
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:55,149
I can because this has been a year where we've had stories about Riot Games, Rockstar Games,

702
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:55,989
Telltale Games.

703
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:58,291
We've had closures.

704
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:58,812
We've had...

705
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:04,274
stories about employees mistreating other employees through a culture of harassment.

706
00:49:04,294 --> 00:49:08,356
Sorry, I'm not asking you to comment on those specifically, which is what I'm building to.

707
00:49:09,496 --> 00:49:16,659
But I guess as the industry has talked more about this, how do you see, like,

708
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:21,901
and it's sort of impossible to ask every company to do what your company does with regards to your

709
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:28,183
values. How do you think other game developers can work to improve their quality of life in

710
00:49:28,223 --> 00:49:28,803
ways like that?

711
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:30,584
just because I think now more than other,

712
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:33,465
I think a lot of developers are very concerned about this

713
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:35,726
because in some cases they feel sort of their health

714
00:49:35,786 --> 00:49:37,507
and their lives are on the edge a little bit,

715
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:38,368
which is a bit dramatic.

716
00:49:38,788 --> 00:49:39,028
Sorry.

717
00:49:39,048 --> 00:49:42,849
No, I mean, should we, studios should be concerned.

718
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,050
Why shouldn't they be?

719
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,471
Yeah.

720
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:47,471
This is about people's lives.

721
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,033
So we take it seriously.

722
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,415
Yeah, I have a certain point of view on this

723
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:54,655
because

724
00:49:55,319 --> 00:50:02,123
My mother's a neurologist. She like helps people with really severe, severe issues, right? So I

725
00:50:02,603 --> 00:50:07,946
just work on video games. So I can like on the one hand, I can put my work into perspective. But,

726
00:50:08,426 --> 00:50:14,410
but having said that, it's really like people work day in and day out on this stuff. And a lot of

727
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:20,794
people's lives do revolve around it for better for worse. So it is important. And studios.

728
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:27,003
owe it to themselves and to the people who work there to be introspective and thoughtful

729
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:33,689
about it in their own way. But apart from that, it's like I can't be prescriptive about it.

730
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:39,914
I don't know that there's a... I'm actually very personally like very... I bristle at the idea that

731
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:45,560
there's like a formula, that there's like a prescription, like studios must do this.

732
00:50:46,422 --> 00:50:49,182
these must be the work hours, this must be the culture.

733
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:50,963
I think it really depends.

734
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:53,643
And there are different studios in different parts

735
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:56,844
of the world and with different team compositions and so on,

736
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:01,025
where it doesn't, there isn't like a one size fits all

737
00:51:01,045 --> 00:51:01,785
solution for them.

738
00:51:01,865 --> 00:51:04,666
And there are studios of all different shapes and sizes

739
00:51:05,346 --> 00:51:07,167
that have succeeded and that have failed.

740
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:10,707
And those are all unique cases with something

741
00:51:11,588 --> 00:51:13,568
for people to learn from, I'm sure.

742
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:20,030
you know, in our case, we're we're doing the best we can here based on our our

743
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:24,412
experience and our observations of what other folks out there are doing. Our

744
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:28,754
discussions with other teams are discussions internally, the kind of

745
00:51:28,774 --> 00:51:33,696
trials and tribulations that we go through. But, you know, we when we

746
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,138
started in 2009, I don't know that any of us would have assumed we'd still be

747
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,018
around by now, you know, having launched our

748
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:45,004
our fourth game. We might have been optimistic about it, but I'm sure we wouldn't have expected it.

749
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:52,449
So I think the truth is everybody is making it up as they go and these discussions that

750
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:58,113
that happen out in the open are really important discussions that I think if they cause

751
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:03,316
other developers and studio leaders to like take a hard look in the mirror or ask themselves if

752
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:07,799
they're things that what blind spots they have, what are they not thinking about that maybe they

753
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:08,099
should be.

754
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:12,108
I think that's all good. There's a lot of responsibility that comes with this stuff.

755
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:16,209
Games have like a really big impact on people. They're expensive, they take a lot of time,

756
00:52:16,229 --> 00:52:19,589
there are ethical issues around them. These are things that people should be thinking about

757
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:27,531
if they want to make games. I hope we are bearing that burden ourselves as responsibly as possible

758
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:33,112
and I know that there will be people out there who tell us if we're not doing that.

759
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:35,893
And for me it's like I'm

760
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:39,349
In the grand scheme of things, I'm glad that that's the way it is.

761
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:46,233
That that that I think I think there are forces in this industry

762
00:52:46,253 --> 00:52:49,695
that will that will keep you honest. And I and I value that a

763
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:54,437
lot as someone who comes from, you know, a background of

764
00:52:54,917 --> 00:53:00,500
reviewing video games. Yeah. You know, having a neurologist for a

765
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:00,760
mother.

766
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:06,321
Yeah, so I hope that answers your question. I'm glad I'm glad

767
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:09,442
the conversations are happening. They're really they're tough

768
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:14,224
conversations, right? It's tough to have all the context. And

769
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,226
and it's easy for stuff to get taken out of context sometimes

770
00:53:17,346 --> 00:53:20,987
and, and people don't really and it could be awkward and but

771
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:24,969
it's, it's it's for the best for for some of the stuff to get out

772
00:53:24,989 --> 00:53:27,450
in the open, in my personal opinion. Yeah.

773
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,478
Well, I mean, that begs the question, did the team crunch on this?

774
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:34,099
And how did it compare to the crunch on Pyre and the crunch on Bastion?

775
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,300
I mean, what do you define?

776
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,260
Define, define.

777
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:37,981
Yeah, right.

778
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:43,423
So it's like, did anyone did you feel like anyone was had to put in extra hours,

779
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:46,944
I guess, above and beyond what they were willing to do in a way that negatively

780
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:49,345
impacted their social life or personal life?

781
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,391
Not beyond what they were. No, I don't.

782
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:53,191
Yeah.

783
00:53:53,211 --> 00:53:55,252
Like, they, they, um, they...

784
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:59,813
There's never, there's never been a moment in the history of this studio where it's like,

785
00:54:00,414 --> 00:54:02,234
like, now your hours are this.

786
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:06,275
But I think, I think that crunch is much more insidious than,

787
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:09,536
than, uh, like the sort of forced work hours.

788
00:54:09,677 --> 00:54:15,698
It can, it can often be that someone is in a situation where they feel, uh, compelled.

789
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:21,545
like no one is telling them or forcing them but they feel like it but they know that they have this deadline and so they're like

790
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:25,670
triangulating the work that must get done in the amount of time so they force themselves to do it.

791
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:36,382
We've we've folks here have worked hard in the past for sure. The but part of our growth on this project is to is to.

792
00:54:37,090 --> 00:55:04,411
diffuse some of that work across more people to so that so that it doesn't fall on as as few shoulders as maybe it has in the past, but, you know, so, so yeah, I mean, I hope that I think the part of it is that I should say is like, it was extremely like, like every, for example, we, we worked, we worked on on Saturday, this past Saturday, or launching our game on Thursday.

793
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,255
We all knew we were going to work on Saturday for months in advance.

794
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,439
And we took the previous Friday off and stuff like that

795
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:15,143
because we we knew we had a weird week coming up with a with a launch

796
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:15,964
on a Thursday night.

797
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:20,570
So we did we we did a whole bunch of planning around our launch week

798
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:22,292
just to give you an impression.

799
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:23,274
And we.

800
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,102
um what was the yeah the other the other part of it is knowing we were launching

801
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:31,465
into early access it was extremely important uh something

802
00:55:31,485 --> 00:55:35,349
that we talked about um and and i think made good on um over

803
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:39,273
and over to to make sure that people went into

804
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:43,097
this week as as well like unlike with a previous

805
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:46,540
game where there can be a temptation to crunch toward the end because then

806
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,541
you're just going to like kind of

807
00:55:48,377 --> 00:55:54,360
get a bunch of time off. Here, the early access launch is just the beginning. So we can't afford

808
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,763
to be all kind of all tired and at our wits end and stuff right now, like because the most

809
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:06,166
important thing with a game like this is the follow-through on the launch. Not just, no one's

810
00:56:06,206 --> 00:56:12,308
going to remember Thursday last week in a few weeks, they barely remember it now. What they're

811
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:17,551
going to remember when they think about our game is our pattern of being able to...

812
00:56:18,673 --> 00:56:21,956
maintain it and for that, you know, that's back to the kind of marathon

813
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:30,825
Training analogy I made before it's it's really about finding a pace that that is healthy for us that we that we can

814
00:56:30,885 --> 00:56:31,425
maintain

815
00:56:31,926 --> 00:56:37,451
Comfortably and take the time we need and we think we're well positioned to do that

816
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:43,556
Yeah, man, I would I would kill to have another hour I would but I I can't take it

817
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:49,900
Yeah, no, yeah, we need to get a couple of these questions rapid fire up before we let you go.

818
00:56:49,920 --> 00:57:00,225
Oh no, there were other questions. Ms. Jim Cloud, we're going to go back to you. What was the

819
00:57:00,265 --> 00:57:03,707
greatest challenge with developing this game outside of the work stuff? Like what was really

820
00:57:03,747 --> 00:57:07,268
great, like challenging in what we're seeing on screen right now?

821
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:10,107
Um, man, let's see.

822
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,748
I think I get another hour long question.

823
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:20,393
Yeah, I think like the, um, it's a whole, it's an entirely new game.

824
00:57:20,553 --> 00:57:21,413
Okay.

825
00:57:21,473 --> 00:57:23,935
No, I have, I have a, I know what exactly the thing is.

826
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:28,337
Each of our previous games has been designed more as like a linear.

827
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:32,110
experience. There's a lot of branching in games like Pyre,

828
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:35,953
and there's a lot of like reactive voiceover in all of our games, but

829
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:37,935
generally speaking there's a beginning, middle, and end,

830
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,257
and you go through it in a succession. So re-approaching this game

831
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:47,282
to be designed around replayability is a is like a sort of a tectonic shift

832
00:57:47,502 --> 00:57:48,983
for us. It's a whole like

833
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:56,544
different mindset in how it's a whole new genre for us, despite the superficial similarities

834
00:57:57,025 --> 00:58:03,947
in the combat game to something like Bastion. So re-approaching both the gameplay and the narrative,

835
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:10,269
knowing that this game is designed to be replayed, is a big shift in thinking and a big shift in the

836
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:14,090
entire underlying architecture of the game. And that was like...

837
00:58:14,974 --> 00:58:18,895
that was like a bite the bullet moment really early on in development where I was like, wow,

838
00:58:19,156 --> 00:58:24,098
this feels really different, but let's keep going. This is exciting. Let's see what happens.

839
00:58:24,758 --> 00:58:28,980
That was like, it was the biggest challenge and a big source of excitement as well,

840
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:36,644
just to work all that out. Right on. All right. Thank you all. Thank you,

841
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:41,706
Greg, so much for joining us. That was a really great conversation. If you're at home,

842
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:43,167
thank you to everyone watching at home.

843
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:45,999
Oh man, yeah, I'm getting a warning about.

844
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:47,460
We are about to keep rolling.

845
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,562
The GDC Twitch channel will keep going

846
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:50,823
with some great GDC talks.

847
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:52,424
If you're an aspiring game developer,

848
00:58:52,444 --> 00:58:53,825
we would love it if you stuck around

849
00:58:53,885 --> 00:58:57,028
and just learned more about how games get made.

850
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,669
If you are a professional game developer,

851
00:58:58,689 --> 00:59:00,550
we hope you find something in there that's useful for you.

852
00:59:01,591 --> 00:59:03,313
If you liked what you had today,

853
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:04,834
we would love it if you click the follow button.

854
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:07,996
Thank you, supergiant community for showing up.

855
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:10,038
And ironically, if you heard too closely,

856
00:59:10,078 --> 00:59:11,219
you heard the Bastion music playing

857
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:12,520
because my phone went off in the other room.

858
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:15,162
Shoutout to Darren.

859
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:17,403
Thank you Alex and Greg.

860
00:59:18,103 --> 00:59:22,065
I suppose for Greg, if folks have other questions for you, I would recommend you check out the

861
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:23,266
Supergiant Games Discord.

862
00:59:23,286 --> 00:59:26,548
You can literally see it when you boot up the game, and I'm sure the link to it's on

863
00:59:26,588 --> 00:59:29,309
the Twitter as well, or any other website.

864
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,411
And with that, have a good day everyone.
