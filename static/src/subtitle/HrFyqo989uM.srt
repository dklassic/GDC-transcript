00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:18,696
Hi GDC and welcome to launch day, the emotional cost of releasing a game.

2
00:00:18,696 --> 00:00:20,357
I'm really honored to be here.

3
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:25,621
Thank you so much for letting me come speak about this topic I feel really passionate

4
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,781
about at the Indie Summit.

5
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:31,985
I'm Lucy Morris. I'm the studio and creative director of StarCult,

6
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:36,129
which is a small indie studio based out of Wellington, New Zealand.

7
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:43,817
And I'm really looking forward today to exploring some of these,

8
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:48,501
you know, quite secretive topics around the launch of periods that we go through.

9
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:54,539
Just to be clear, I'm not going to be talking to you about how to release your indie game.

10
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,585
There's an almost infinite amount of resources out there and think faces on the best ways

11
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:06,471
to go about this and anything that I say at this point I feel is probably just replication

12
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,733
of those things.

13
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:18,362
But what we don't see a lot of analysis of is the emotional and non-technical side of things running up to release

14
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:23,007
and the struggles that come directly after launch, especially for smaller teams.

15
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:28,925
After my studio released our first title last year and the dust had settled a bit, I thought

16
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:33,307
about this a lot and I wrote a Medium article as kind of a cathartic activity.

17
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:39,709
So I wanted to get these complex and difficult emotions about this period out and also to

18
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:46,632
see if I was alone in these struggles as we navigate this honestly really difficult environment

19
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:48,493
that we launch titles into at the moment.

20
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:56,990
In terms of I wasn't alone and the article seemed to resonate with quite a few people.

21
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:03,737
So this is a talk on things that we went through, experiences that we had and how to prepare

22
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:08,041
yourself and your team emotionally to release an indie game.

23
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,685
What I strongly believe is that there's a gap in our knowledge that...

24
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,857
It strikes us how to navigate launches in a way that's sustainable to us and sustainable to our teams

25
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:27,224
and ways to protect ourselves from some of the more unforgiving parts of this gauntlet that all of us are running through.

26
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:32,170
Therefore, this is a talk to prepare yourself for that time,

27
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,953
especially from the perspective of a team from a country that's

28
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:38,135
often left off of maps and popular media,

29
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:42,479
and a tool to jumpstart discussions on the sometimes unrealistic expectations

30
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:48,284
that we set for ourselves, as well as those that others set for us in our launch windows.

31
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:56,981
So in August 2020, we released our first title, Best Friend Forever, on PC and Nintendo Switch.

32
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:02,143
I won't go too much into the game itself in this talk, but for brevity's sake, it's a

33
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:07,265
dating sim crossed with a dog care simulator. You pet the dogs and you pet the owners.

34
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:16,047
To give some context for the tips on this talk and the findings that we found, I'm going to

35
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:20,848
tell you a little bit about our timeline and the challenges we encountered

36
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:25,089
and also the emotional reality of launching a game during COVID.

37
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:32,092
I acknowledge full-heartedly that in New Zealand we've been really lucky in terms of our government's

38
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:37,517
response to the pandemic, but I think it would also be remiss not to talk about the emotional

39
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:42,742
cost of launching a game in the current climate and ignore the elephant in the room.

40
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:48,047
The pandemic is something that has affected and is affecting everyone and will continue

41
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:50,109
to do so for the foreseeable future.

42
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,233
And this also has an impact on the non-technical aspects of our release cycles.

43
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:59,937
It's affecting us emotionally and physically.

44
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:03,619
And in addition, if anyone listening to this has even worked on a game or released a game

45
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:09,824
during the pandemic, congratulations, because it has not been easy and I am very proud of you.

46
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,923
So this was our planned timeline.

47
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:18,126
The studio started up in 2019 at the start of the year.

48
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,648
We spent a month setting up the studio and hiring,

49
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:24,570
bouncing around ideas what the project would be.

50
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,852
And on February 2019, we started full production.

51
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:35,074
Generally, I was aiming for pretty tight production timelines of smaller projects in which we

52
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:40,477
could spend about a year to a year and a half producing something that would then in turn

53
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:48,101
give us more runway in terms of diversifying our game portfolio and future-proofing the

54
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,062
future of the studio.

55
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:56,544
So we announced, planned for an announce around August and moving into pre-production slightly

56
00:04:56,544 --> 00:05:02,407
after August with the intention to release in 2020 on Valentine's Day, which would be very

57
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:10,031
fitting for a dating sim. Unfortunately, our actual timeline ended up something like this

58
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:16,474
and I feel like this timeline might be quite relatable to anyone that's been navigating

59
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:17,695
release cycles recently.

60
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:20,879
So this is how we headed into 2020.

61
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,945
We were battle weary and we were utterly exhausted from all the storms that were

62
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:33,410
weathered. As you can see, you know, at the start it was pretty predictable and

63
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,111
it was cohesive to our timeline.

64
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:38,914
In August, we announced the project for Nintendo Direct at Gamescom.

65
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:47,678
And then in 2020, we encountered like a few normal roadblocks that a first game studio

66
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:52,220
would encounter and I think that pushed our first release date back a little bit.

67
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,102
But at the start of 2020, also COVID started up, so we announced a delay in February that we

68
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:01,723
wouldn't be able to release on Valentine's Day. We pushed it back to May 14th.

69
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:08,523
In April, New Zealand went into strict lockdown for five or six weeks,

70
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:13,784
where we weren't allowed to leave the house except for our state mandated half an hour exercise,

71
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:16,025
or to go to the doctor or the supermarket.

72
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:22,826
And this was two weeks after we received a new programmer from Australia.

73
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:27,207
We had to pack down our new office that we had just moved into, move back home, and...

74
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:34,091
This was a really difficult period for us as I'm sure lots of people listening to this can relate to

75
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:41,434
having to maintain the same sort of production output, but have your

76
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:47,998
working life and personal life completely upended while you've got these, you know, international pressures going on.

77
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:53,382
So May comes around and we have to delay again.

78
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,463
Things are getting blown out.

79
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:59,284
The world is reeling from what's going on.

80
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,384
Timelines are impossible to predict.

81
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,105
And the one good thing about this period

82
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:07,966
was that community was largely really supportive

83
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,186
of these delays.

84
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:12,627
At least consumers largely seem to understand

85
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:15,108
the struggles that everybody is going through

86
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,728
in terms of COVID right now.

87
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,751
But this was demoralizing.

88
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:26,773
We managed to hit out of production around late May and

89
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:27,693
hit it into post-production.

90
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:30,994
And then in August, 27th, we managed to release, and I still

91
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:37,197
can't quite believe this happened because it just, it's.

92
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,865
so hard to release the game during during this late in the middle of this

93
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:46,754
climate. I am so proud of my team and like sometimes I still think about how

94
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:48,857
amazing and

95
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:55,937
impressive it was to be able to get this game out with all these challenges going on in the background.

96
00:07:55,937 --> 00:08:03,240
It shows immense mental and emotional fortitude to achieve something like this.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,562
And then we moved into live ops afterwards, which was quite an intense period, the immediate

98
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:12,143
post-launch maintenance period.

99
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:18,504
And I feel like this is really when the emotional cost of development was at its highest.

100
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:21,645
It was a really intense and difficult time.

101
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:25,466
And around November, the intense live ops kind of ended,

102
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:31,887
and then it just went onwards indefinitely in terms of supporting the game.

103
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:38,248
Like, technically, the game is still not complete because we are always updating it,

104
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:41,188
we're always adding patches, we're always adding extra content.

105
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:41,328
So...

106
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,390
It's not really, is it ever really done?

107
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,112
I guess is the question.

108
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:50,574
So heading into release window in August,

109
00:08:50,574 --> 00:08:52,175
we were already tired.

110
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:55,597
We were at the usual end of Project Fatigue

111
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:56,858
where the last 10% takes 90% of the work.

112
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,700
And this was also our first title.

113
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,082
So we poured a lot in trying to make the game,

114
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:07,525
make our mark as a lot of indies do with their first title.

115
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:13,981
We were demoralized from announcing delays and pushing back our release three times.

116
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,067
It was an understandable disappointment for my community.

117
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:23,415
It was a disappointment to us because we just really wanted to share what we have been working

118
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:24,577
on.

119
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:30,848
And outwardly, it seems like delays can mean a reprieve in terms of work,

120
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:35,051
but as developers, you understand that a delay just means a longer time

121
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,453
until the payoff of release.

122
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:41,035
It means a long time working on the same project and a longer time

123
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:45,338
before you see the revenue generation from the game, which is,

124
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:49,000
you know, a studio owner is an extra stressor.

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,344
We were already demoralized from these delays, and we

126
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,565
really wanted to share what we thought was like a utopian story that the world needed at that point.

127
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:02,266
We were already stressed

128
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:09,071
mostly because there were so many unknown surrounding release and this was true before COVID.

129
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:15,577
But especially during the pandemic these stresses were exacerbated in terms of

130
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:22,422
you know, whether it would be received well, what the reviews would say, what issues might be cropping up that need triaging and patching.

131
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:28,506
But also because we had encountered so many roadblocks coming up to this point,

132
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:32,109
it almost felt like when is the other shoe going to drop?

133
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:37,592
Not knowing how external partners were going to manage their own processes

134
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:42,135
amidst their own COVID situations, which is super difficult to navigate.

135
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:45,398
Not being able to estimate timelines

136
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:49,960
when dates are like the holy grail in the games press cycle.

137
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:58,766
not being able to perform at the same level of quality and finesse as releases pre-COVID,

138
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:05,969
you're expected to still meet that bar, despite the fact that the world stage is completely different right now.

139
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:10,791
But we were excited because we'd been working on this for a year and a half.

140
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,332
We were passionate about it. We loved the project.

141
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:18,418
and we had seen people love playing it at shows, we had a community that had started to build around

142
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:23,600
that that was very supportive and very kind, and we just wanted to contribute this positive

143
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,962
story to a world that was currently turned upside down. And we were glad it was out, but it wasn't

144
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:37,586
done. We pushed the button and it released, but it's never done once you do that. I'm definitely

145
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:43,148
not saying anything in this talk just to be clear that this is gospel or anything, but

146
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:52,571
Personally, my experience of this immediate post-launch time period was the most difficult

147
00:11:52,571 --> 00:12:02,382
part of the whole production cycle. Even bug squashing and other roadblocks that we encountered

148
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:04,404
wasn't as draining as this was.

149
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:10,056
launches your one chance at the moment to legitimize the purpose of your entire production cycle,

150
00:12:10,056 --> 00:12:16,542
a year and a half of work, the investment of a significant period of time to create one thing,

151
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:21,988
to prove your concept fully in terms of realization and reception,

152
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:25,311
and likely your biggest chance to make your mark with this artifact.

153
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:32,879
And as in recent past we can see the zeitgeist coming back around and sometimes that does happen.

154
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,825
It's super rare and the botched launch is something that never fails to make headlines in games.

155
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:45,571
It's all in all at once and launch has an immense amount of pressure tied to it because of this.

156
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:52,866
So, Pain Point 1, I feel the emotional cost of launching games

157
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,787
encompasses several pain points.

158
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:57,970
The first of which being the end point of production

159
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,851
is becoming extremely ephemeral.

160
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:03,013
Some of the emotional drain from these launch windows

161
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:06,435
definitely seems to stem from the amount of unpredictability

162
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,757
that comes with pressing the release button.

163
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:15,400
The immediate period after launch can be busy keeping up with press, communicating with the community.

164
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:23,324
These are all incredibly time-consuming and sometimes exhausting activities that come at the end of an already full development cycle.

165
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:25,686
But even aside from that, it seems like...

166
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:30,326
we're almost going towards games a continual service,

167
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:33,747
not the sense that games are a service and free to play.

168
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,689
But the amount of work that is involved post launch

169
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,129
to stay competitive in this market,

170
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:41,150
compared to even say five years ago,

171
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,231
is growing considerably.

172
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:47,312
So I did a very scientific survey on Twitter.

173
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,713
I asked a few questions to developers

174
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:52,775
who had released at least one commercial title.

175
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,662
And these are some topics that I've been thinking about since release, and even now, almost a year

176
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:06,365
later, still releasing patches, still releasing content, still releasing seasonal content to

177
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:15,569
eke out some exposure in sales. And although this isn't quite the traditional sense of

178
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:20,291
Games as a Service as I mentioned, the endpoint of games is moving further and further and further

179
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:20,351
out.

180
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:26,234
We are a continual service if we want a fighting chance these days,

181
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:30,059
and we are providing continual support, and in a lot of cases,

182
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,721
updates and content if we want to be seen.

183
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:35,045
And this has a cost, like not in terms of...

184
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:42,491
this is more work that I have to do, but you never really get closure on things at the moment if you

185
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:51,617
want to buff your long tail or if you are super interested in maximizing the worth of your game

186
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:52,177
over time.

187
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:57,179
So the first question, did you patch your title within 24 hours of releasing?

188
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,301
This includes making a patch build, submitting it to a platform review queue,

189
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:04,102
or making a patch build and pushing it to users live.

190
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:06,923
75 people surveyed, 76% said yes.

191
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:11,906
So this already shows that there is a very like on-call nature in terms of

192
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:16,248
games, that there is a very immediate expectation that issues are supposed

193
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,729
to be fixed very quickly.

194
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:22,371
And that I feel is another pressure that we have to acknowledge here.

195
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:27,705
How many patches did you push within seven days of release?

196
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:31,747
54 people responded and 85% said one to three.

197
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,728
And I acknowledge this question's very broad

198
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,949
because we don't know the length and breadth

199
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:36,569
of those patches.

200
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,889
We don't know how big they are

201
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:40,511
or what amount of development time went into it.

202
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:43,352
But I still think that this shows

203
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:46,754
that there is a significant amount of work

204
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:51,376
immediately post-release that comes from

205
00:15:52,237 --> 00:16:02,512
just a place of almost unrealistic expectations of our time and our ability to respond to things

206
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:06,458
quickly. If you want to be

207
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:12,170
Featured in a holiday sale, you need to update your game with holiday themed content.

208
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,054
If you want to capitalize on momentum after release, like here, you need to keep a watchful

209
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:23,958
eye on issues that crop up, issues in Steam reviews, and plan into production where feasible

210
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,220
to mitigate these sorts of things happening after release.

211
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,642
you want to fix them, you want to add content, and if you want to keep your community happy,

212
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:38,743
you need to be almost on call, watching the social media channels, keeping an eye on emails,

213
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:43,065
vetting content creators, doing interviews, responding to reviews that present issues,

214
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:48,006
stay on steam. So production and launch are really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of

215
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,046
production cycles.

216
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:55,829
and it plunges us straight into this games as a continual service cycle that feels like a

217
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:02,933
hangover after the already intense period of development. Have you built or pushed a patch

218
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:08,636
outside of your normal working hours for your title, after hours or overtime? 57 respondents

219
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:14,779
with 75% saying yes. I feel like this is also concerning because it is showing that

220
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:24,161
we have that on-call nature after release, we are so worried about how negative things like bugs or

221
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:30,844
less than stellar experiences, which I'm sure no developer wants their consumers to have and is

222
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:37,727
more than happy to fix, the pressure from having to fix these because of the impact of things,

223
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,148
of like say negative Steam reviews.

224
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:48,990
is becoming more and more of a pressure, and we're having to respond to it quicker and quicker.

225
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:56,792
We're expected to be continually responsive in launch windows, turn things around at an almost

226
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:02,673
inhuman pace because that launch window is so critical, and then to a lesser extent around

227
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:06,894
the windows of visibility in the events to follow, say like summer sales.

228
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:13,632
It's now expected to launch patches immediately, if not within a day of finding an issue.

229
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:18,975
Launch bugs, as we've all seen in the press, can make or break a title, and losing that

230
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:24,559
edge to negative reviews, no matter how quickly or easily the bug is fixed, can impact your

231
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,940
title's entire lifespan.

232
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:33,585
That combined leads to this huge nebulous on-call pressure that we have to respond immediately,

233
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:36,827
we have to be constantly vigilant, that we have to be...

234
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,497
just hugely emotionally invested.

235
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:44,242
And I think this is definitely something that we should talk about a bit more.

236
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:50,746
Pain point two, post-launch on top of pre-production is painful.

237
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,908
It's not just about releasing a game.

238
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:58,832
While you're knee deep in this pool of lava that is post-launch,

239
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:03,775
you also have to have the brain space to be directing pre-production on the next thing.

240
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,178
And this will depend on how you run your studio, but as I mentioned at the start of the talk,

241
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:11,360
I really wanted to have tight production cycles.

242
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:11,440
So...

243
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:19,287
have a good foundation to move forward into the next project as quickly as possible.

244
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:24,772
So I had to have the brain space to be creative and look towards the next thing.

245
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:31,719
The presence of mind to learn from my mistakes from this launch and be objective,

246
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:35,202
while also knee deep in this lava.

247
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:43,809
I have to be able to support and guide my team towards our next shot to sustain the studio

248
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:52,512
while looking at this miasma and wondering if I caused them or if it was my fault or something I

249
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:57,354
could have done better for my team, something I could have guided us to avoid. And that period

250
00:19:57,354 --> 00:20:04,597
post-launch, especially for people directing, is incredibly confronting. If things go wrong,

251
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:05,298
we've...

252
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:15,351
we feel bad. We feel sometimes guilty or ashamed or, you know, if only I had worked harder I could

253
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:21,037
have caught this. If only I had done X, Y, Z then, you know, this process might have been easier.

254
00:20:21,037 --> 00:20:23,760
And I definitely felt a lot of that after the game came out.

255
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:30,487
But at the same time, I want this difficult feedback.

256
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:36,932
It's just on top of having to be intensely creative, overlapping with pre-prod, that

257
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,394
is intensely difficult.

258
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:45,955
That's the dichotomy that I experienced after launch.

259
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:51,077
It's hard and it's exhausting and it's the most difficult thing I've had to do

260
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:54,038
is to be objective and be a buffer for the team

261
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,960
while also trying to tap into a very exhausted,

262
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,221
creative part of me to move forward into the next project.

263
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:02,742
And.

264
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:07,645
I think it can't be understated that often we're creating emotional work at a large emotional

265
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:12,167
cost to ourselves, which may not be immediately apparent, but definitely has become more apparent

266
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,728
to me going forward.

267
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:19,891
The release playing field is now less level than it ever was, and I feel like this is

268
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:24,053
the biggest hurt that I continue to feel in terms of release, but the one I feel is also

269
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:28,876
most unlikely to change, because this is mostly out of our reach.

270
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:37,732
you are expected to perform at the same level of finesse, of quality, as anyone did pre-COVID.

271
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:45,217
You were judged on the same playing field as you ever were, and the reality is that

272
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:48,339
that playing field is not level in terms of...

273
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:54,539
team size, you were judged in the same way, regardless of world stresses.

274
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:59,265
It's been very, very difficult to reconcile the fact that we're being judged

275
00:21:59,265 --> 00:22:04,010
the same, having struggled through a release and a pandemic than before.

276
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:10,833
Regardless of team resources, regardless of where your staff is located and what your

277
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:11,734
time zone is.

278
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:15,695
For instance, Launch Window is a very North American time zone centric and we often found

279
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:21,398
ourselves being up at four in the morning to action things, which is exhausting and

280
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:26,680
it's another physical and emotional commitment to make to this process.

281
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,363
And regardless of connections, like who you know, what publisher you found.

282
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:39,164
depending on where you're located in the world as well, like there could be very few or quite a lot

283
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:44,986
of options open to you. And regardless of experimentation, in terms of production,

284
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:52,649
I've often noticed that experimentation and subverting of genre is very welcome when

285
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:59,973
you release. That is very much not the case. And when expectations are subverted and money is

286
00:22:59,973 --> 00:23:03,534
involved, the reception is quite different. So...

287
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:10,277
I just found the entire playing field quite uneven in many ways.

288
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:13,280
And it's very easy to sit here and say, hey, that's unfair.

289
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,541
We're all in the same boat.

290
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:21,186
And we should recognize that and know that we are all in that same boat.

291
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:27,871
We are all working to some time, like this standard up here that we might not all be

292
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:30,493
able to reach because of anything on this list.

293
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:31,774
And we will be judged the same.

294
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:32,875
And I think

295
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:38,959
This will tie into a point I'm going to make in a second, which is be kind to yourself and be realistic.

296
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,202
Paint.4 launch was about making wrongs right.

297
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:46,104
And that is good, but it eclipsed enjoying what rights were right for us.

298
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:52,229
If you're a community manager, or if you're like the head of a studio or planning biz dev,

299
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:57,212
you'll have to kind of just wade into everything negative about the game when it launches.

300
00:23:57,535 --> 00:24:02,416
because you have to, because you need to react to it and you need to action those things.

301
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:09,439
When positive or negative reviews dictate so much of our worth and future viability on storefronts,

302
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,380
you need to digest these narratives and engage with them.

303
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,780
And that is super important.

304
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,742
But I think it's also important to acknowledge this overwhelming and draining.

305
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:21,062
This is something that you've worked on for a long time.

306
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,863
It is natural to feel like this process is difficult.

307
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:26,516
And that's not to say don't fix bugs.

308
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:29,116
Definitely do fix bugs, but do it sustainably.

309
00:24:29,116 --> 00:24:31,237
We wanted this feedback.

310
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:34,578
We only wanted our consumers to have the best experience.

311
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:37,818
And yeah, like anything touched with sweaty human hands

312
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:41,459
that came out with flaws and imperfections.

313
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:43,620
We released eight patches in 77 days

314
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,600
with 40 to 50 fixes as a team of just four.

315
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,481
And we responded to bug reports via email, Twitter,

316
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:52,182
Facebook, Discord, Steam forums.

317
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:56,707
We monitored email channels and we itemized quality of life feedback so we could give

318
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,531
our consumers like an actionable plan going forward.

319
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:05,867
And we wanted to give them the best experience, the experience we wanted them to have.

320
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:12,230
And at the end of this highly charged marathon, we were just like heaving for breath at this point.

321
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,813
And it is hard, like you want to enjoy this imperfect, sweaty creation, but instead of like

322
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:21,675
sitting there and just looking at it, you've immediately got to be going, right, what's wrong?

323
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:26,858
Let's, you know, let's fix this issue. Let's make everybody happier because you want to.

324
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:32,676
Have you felt pressured to create a patch outside of normal working hours,

325
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:36,863
after hours or overtime because of negative reviews, complaints or social

326
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:41,189
media pressure? 50 respondents, 70% said yes. I feel like

327
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:45,692
This is also something that we should be talking about.

328
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:55,264
This is people saying that they feel the need to work on call because of the negative impact

329
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:59,629
that these expectations are having on us and on our games.

330
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:05,554
We obviously need to create a more sustainable system where we can

331
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:10,338
work on these things healthily and not create such

332
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:13,941
unrealistic expectations for ourselves.

333
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:20,167
Do you currently have any negative reviews on your product on any platform for issues that have since been patched?

334
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,808
46 respondents, 76% say yes.

335
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:23,716
This is also important.

336
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:29,838
We have all of this pressure on us, and even despite our best efforts,

337
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:35,360
it can still result in things that negatively affect our long tails

338
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,741
that might not always be super accurate.

339
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:42,243
And I'm not often one to talk about Apple, but having reviews

340
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:45,584
that are only reflected in terms of the latest patch or the latest update,

341
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,308
might be a way to get around this.

342
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,753
I don't know, I'm not here to create new game platforms or anything,

343
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:56,659
but there are definitely issues in this ecosystem

344
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,141
that we should probably discuss.

345
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:02,287
What would we change for round two that we could have changed?

346
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:08,586
A lot of this is kind of out of our hands. But change one, we would have sort of facilitated

347
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:15,192
better peer feedback and pre prod or early production, specifically peer feedback. We had

348
00:27:15,192 --> 00:27:20,216
tons of consumer feedback, but that imbalance really worked against us when we when we launched

349
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:26,281
and we saw that there were some, you know, issues with design and systems that I feel like only

350
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:31,305
an experienced peer probably could have caught beforehand. So

351
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:35,518
I came up with this amazing Venn diagram, very artistic.

352
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:39,900
This is what you need in pre-prod to early prod,

353
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,001
which is the Holy Grail of feedback.

354
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:45,342
You want it to be feedback you can action, feedback that's realistic

355
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:48,763
for your team's resources, your production timeline.

356
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:51,744
And, you know, if you're at a point in production, the things

357
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:54,606
that might be suggested that are difficult to implement

358
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:58,127
because they are simply the nature of game development, you can't do everything.

359
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:04,769
Feedback you can trust from peers that have experience, that know what they're talking about,

360
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:10,231
that can save you from walking off any cliffs accidentally that they might have done in the

361
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,392
past and avoid you replicating easily avoidable mistakes.

362
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,734
And feedback that's constructive.

363
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:18,474
Very important.

364
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:19,915
We don't just want people to tell us,

365
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:21,416
hey, your game sucks.

366
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,958
The ultimate sweet spot is things

367
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:28,359
that you can actually implement from sources

368
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,040
that you can trust and that you can rely on

369
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,082
and that are constructive in a way

370
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:36,163
that actually allows you to take action

371
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,464
and implement those things.

372
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,149
But getting this good peer feedback is hindered by our weaknesses and not giving

373
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:45,517
good feedback. It is not easy to give good feedback.

374
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,322
And this is something we really need to work on.

375
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:52,011
not being able to receive feedback objectively, not wanting to hurt feelings,

376
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:56,074
few established channels to get that grail feedback, and the fact that good feedback

377
00:28:56,074 --> 00:29:03,099
takes time and effort, which a lot of us are lacking. And it was cathartic and relieving

378
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:07,421
to hear compliments about our game but we honestly needed more critical grail feedback

379
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:08,963
to save this pain down the line.

380
00:29:10,276 --> 00:29:14,623
I had relief to help outside our time zone working hours and launch window.

381
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:19,230
Again, we were in GMT plus 12, everything went out in PST time zones.

382
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,573
We were working at 4am.

383
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:22,475
It was crappy.

384
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:26,490
Manage expectations and be kind to ourselves,

385
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,932
realizing that that playing field isn't even,

386
00:29:28,932 --> 00:29:32,876
taking time to appreciate the successes that we've had

387
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:36,460
and the things we've managed to achieve is really important.

388
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,262
Block out time for that in your team to do this

389
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:43,186
and be mindful of what you've accomplished.

390
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:45,548
Have a bit of post-prog plan for both mechanical

391
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,470
and non-mechanical needs.

392
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:54,730
This involved, you know, things like self-care, protecting the team, hiring

393
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,813
that comms person to be a buffer between the negative feedback and translating

394
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:04,896
it when the team might be feeling raw, I think is really important.

395
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:08,678
And keep talking about this and not forgetting the value you bring with the

396
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:10,800
launch, platforms are lucky to have you.

397
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,022
And we should be talking about these things to hold them accountable.

398
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:22,569
So a summary, seek support and counsel from others who have been through the process.

399
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:30,136
Be kind, be realistic, make sure that you realise where you stand in terms of trying

400
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:34,240
to achieve these very, very high expectations.

401
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,184
What kind of state the world is in at the moment.

402
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:43,770
Plan forward for extra support, blind spots, buffers and time zone issues.

403
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,374
We definitely would hire a community manager or a comms manager to go through

404
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:53,198
all of this feedback and all of these channels after launch and really help us

405
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:58,483
not just in terms of being awake when we're not, but also being able to be a

406
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:02,947
little bit of a buffer when you're in this launch period and feelings might be

407
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:03,688
raw and, and.

408
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:10,472
you know, tensions might be high because it was definitely a difficult time for us.

409
00:31:10,472 --> 00:31:14,995
Work constructive peer feedback into your production cycle from an early stage.

410
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:23,360
So accessing peer knowledge, not being afraid to expose designs and receive

411
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,423
critical feedback, even though you might be protective and very loving of your

412
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:28,863
systems.

413
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:33,724
This is definitely something we're actioning going forward into our next project.

414
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:40,386
And we definitely, I specifically have to be less precious about receiving feedback

415
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:45,447
because in the end, I want feedback that I can trust that's actionable and that is going

416
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:50,208
to give the game the best shot in this really difficult environment we're launching into.

417
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:57,129
That is super helpful and peers don't want you to be replicating their mistakes.

418
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,128
So that was a lot.

419
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:01,730
Thank you so much for listening.

420
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,013
If you want to contact me, you can email me here.

421
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:09,296
And best of luck with your launches.
