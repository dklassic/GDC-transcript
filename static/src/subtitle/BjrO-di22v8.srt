1
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,850
All right, hi everybody, and thanks for coming.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,191
So for people who don't know who I am,

3
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,752
I run a game studio called Shell Games.

4
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:16,893
And I also teach at the Entertainment Technology Center

5
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:19,074
at Carnegie Mellon University.

6
00:00:19,074 --> 00:00:22,715
I used to be at Disney at the virtual reality studio there.

7
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,216
And I wrote a book called The Art of Game Design.

8
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:25,296
So.

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:30,223
Today we're going to talk about futurist storytelling.

10
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:34,364
Now, some of you younger people, younger game developers,

11
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,725
may not be aware that the company you know as EA

12
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:39,306
used to be called Electronic Arts.

13
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:46,308
It is said they changed the name when the irony became

14
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,288
too much for them to bear.

15
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:53,589
They were a very different company when they were young.

16
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:58,511
They were a company that really, really was focused on how do you create great, deep,

17
00:00:58,511 --> 00:00:59,611
meaningful experiences.

18
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:05,213
And they would talk a lot about how are we going to create the future of storytelling.

19
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:10,255
And one of the phrases that came up often was how, what would it take to create a game

20
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:11,976
that would make people cry.

21
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,237
They would talk about questions like this.

22
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:16,198
And that was a long time ago.

23
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,878
We're talking about 30 years ago.

24
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:26,779
And how are we doing in terms of our incredible, epic, great storytelling?

25
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:33,821
I think there's been some progress, but still, I don't think the world takes us very seriously.

26
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:39,342
Not seriously like they take the stage and great immortal stories on the stage.

27
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:42,003
Shakespeare stories are incredible.

28
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:45,964
We like them so well that even though the language has moved on, we still tell them

29
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,784
the same way because we're afraid to touch it.

30
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,339
Literature, certainly.

31
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:54,701
We know that there are great, great, amazing novels.

32
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:57,482
And even film.

33
00:01:57,482 --> 00:02:00,323
There are things in film that people

34
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:02,064
say that is a great story.

35
00:02:02,064 --> 00:02:04,525
That is truly epic, classic storytelling

36
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,887
that may last hundreds of years.

37
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:10,108
And how are we doing in games?

38
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,609
Yeah.

39
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:16,511
Yeah, one of these things is not like the other, unfortunately.

40
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:16,811
Right?

41
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:25,616
You know, so where, what, are we going to have a Shakespeare of games?

42
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:30,277
Are we going to have games that are like, this game was told so perfectly and so well

43
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:35,199
that 200 years from now when people play it, they need to play it exactly as it was?

44
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,599
Is that going to happen? Is that a thing?

45
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,020
Or is that just not possible with our medium?

46
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,981
There are weaknesses that our medium has,

47
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:46,343
and we need to face up to those,

48
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:47,726
because if we're going to get better at this,

49
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,168
we're going to have to confront them.

50
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,292
One of them is a problem of verbs.

51
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,134
So, right now we have video game verbs.

52
00:02:55,134 --> 00:03:00,319
They tend to be things like running and shooting and jumping and climbing and throwing and punching.

53
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,861
You watch a movie, it's a different story.

54
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:04,744
There's a lot of verbs in it that are different.

55
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:08,448
Talking and negotiating and arguing and pleading and complaining.

56
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:12,813
And you'll notice the difference here is a difference that is, goes there.

57
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:18,550
Movie verbs are up here, and a lot of the video game verbs are just down here.

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,751
We're really good at the below the neck verbs.

59
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:21,772
We got those.

60
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:25,095
It's the above the neck verbs that we are missing.

61
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:27,196
And can we get those into our games?

62
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:30,779
If we can find ways to get those, it's going to make a big difference.

63
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,500
So that's the first problem.

64
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,602
Second problem.

65
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:37,804
People talk about theater, they talk about comedy and tragedy.

66
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:39,586
You know what we suck at?

67
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:39,946
Tragedy.

68
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,971
it's not really a thing for us. If we're doing

69
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:47,354
interactive Romeo and Juliet, what happens? Oh my god,

70
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:48,775
she died. Well, let me go back to the

71
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,076
checkpoint. We're gonna fix that up.

72
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:52,653
There we go.

73
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:53,994
Straightened out.

74
00:03:53,994 --> 00:03:54,334
Go us.

75
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,114
Right?

76
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:59,395
I'm not saying doing tragedy is impossible in video games.

77
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:00,616
It's just hard.

78
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,556
And does everything have to be tragedy?

79
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,277
No.

80
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,677
But it is interesting to think about when

81
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,738
people look at the greatest stories of all time,

82
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,639
they often point to tragedies and say, yes, this

83
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,339
is a truly great story.

84
00:04:11,339 --> 00:04:14,621
And it would be sad if that area of greatness

85
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,821
was off limits to us.

86
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:22,383
So a third problem is this problem of unification, of wholeness, of unity.

87
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:28,575
All great stories, the ending is foreordained by the beginning.

88
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:34,209
When Cinderella is all filthy in the fireplace,

89
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:38,731
like, there's no option for this story other than for her to become the princess at the end.

90
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:40,911
This story makes no sense if she's like,

91
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:44,933
forget you, stepmother, and gets a job as a waitress around the corner in her own little apartment

92
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:47,574
and lives kind of mediocrely ever after.

93
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:47,974
No, that sucks.

94
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:53,278
That's a lousy story. That story, like the first five seconds of the story, determine the ending.

95
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:58,002
And when you have interactive stories, can we really have that and still have greatness?

96
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:00,845
That may be our biggest challenge of all that we have to confront.

97
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:06,790
I don't know if people have seen this movie. This is an incredible movie, Hamlet 2.

98
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:12,564
And I'm going to show you a clip from it because I think this clip, better than anything else,

99
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:18,508
summarizes the way the great storytellers of the world look at video game storytellers.

100
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:25,773
So, in, uh, just to set this up, uh, the guy who, uh, uh, runs this, uh, drama club at

101
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:29,316
school has gotten complaints from parents who are pulling their kids out of the play

102
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:34,279
and he goes to visit one of the, the parents, goes to visit the parents of one of the kids.

103
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:38,599
I guess our concerns about the play are of a different nature.

104
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:42,302
If it's the sex and violence, I can totally tone that down.

105
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,364
We're fine with those.

106
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:45,125
Then what is it?

107
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:53,852
We merely expressed our absolute distaste for a sequel to what is arguably the greatest play in the English language.

108
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:59,617
Not to mention the quality of the writing, which is quite low.

109
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:03,900
Well, no offense, but what the hockey puck do you know?

110
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:08,209
I've published nine novels. I have a PhD in literature.

111
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,130
My wife is a painter.

112
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,113
She currently has an exhibit at the Guggenheim in Bilbao.

113
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:13,833
Oh, okay.

114
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,674
Then...

115
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:19,979
help me fix my play. I'm trying to save drama.

116
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,142
You have Hamlet using a time machine

117
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:27,925
to stop Gertrude from drinking the poison,

118
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,387
to stop Ophelia from drowning.

119
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,909
You're taking the tragedy out of the tragedy.

120
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:37,252
I just wondered why in Hamlet 1 everybody has to die.

121
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:38,853
It's such a downer.

122
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:44,158
I mean, if Hamlet had had just a little bit of therapy, he could have turned everything around.

123
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,640
Everybody deserves a second chance.

124
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,620
Yeah. And I think mostly we look like that.

125
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:59,156
right? Because that's what we do. We take, we create ridiculous stories with zombies and

126
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:05,079
monsters and time machines and we always set it up so that no matter what there's going to be a

127
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,541
happy ending. And it's a challenge for us.

128
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:15,312
So, as we break this down, one of the things I often talk about is this notion of the elemental tetrad,

129
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:19,334
that all games have four components. Obviously, we're talking about story here.

130
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:23,636
And we, it's, I'm not saying, hey, is it, are we challenged by making great games?

131
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:28,439
Of course we make great games. There are great games, there have been great games for thousands of years.

132
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,961
And we're going to continue to make great games.

133
00:07:30,961 --> 00:07:33,222
I'm specifically focusing on the question of...

134
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:39,689
Is it possible for games to have truly great world-class story enmeshed in them?

135
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:45,435
And we've had some good ones, but I don't think we've had anything immortal yet.

136
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:52,242
And so if it can come, it's going to come because our medium is going to change in some way.

137
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:56,826
And I think it probably won't because of the changes in aesthetics.

138
00:07:57,232 --> 00:08:02,757
I think it's going to be either changes in mechanics or changes in technology.

139
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,240
And then the question remains, which one is it?

140
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,643
Do we have to wait around for technology to get better before we can have great stories?

141
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:12,687
Or could it be there's just some simple game mechanics we haven't thought of that will

142
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:15,049
help enable the infusion of great stories?

143
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:18,132
I think there are arguments for mechanics.

144
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,116
Phoenix Wright is a fascinating game.

145
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:26,303
The stories are interesting and engaging and it's not like we haven't had crime drama games

146
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:26,764
before.

147
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,267
We've had them since the early 80s.

148
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:33,834
They just were never very good and it was a clever mechanic that they figured out in

149
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:34,415
Phoenix Wright.

150
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,476
They figured out...

151
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:37,997
a kind of a time travel mechanic.

152
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:40,237
When you were doing the interrogation,

153
00:08:40,237 --> 00:08:43,178
normally dialogue happens in a linear fashion,

154
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:46,299
because in the real world dialogue happens in a linear fashion.

155
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:50,081
But in Phoenix Wright, the testimony is laid out for you

156
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:53,362
and you can scrub over it and go to any point and dig in

157
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,503
and say, wait a minute, I see a contradiction here.

158
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:57,623
And when you nail that contradiction,

159
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,824
suddenly the testimony changes.

160
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:02,205
Like, that doesn't happen in the real world,

161
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:05,207
but it happens here and it makes for a great game.

162
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,829
Someone could have thought of this mechanic at Infocom in 1982

163
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,070
and it would have been fine, it would have been great,

164
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,091
but nobody thought of it.

165
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,472
It may be there are more mechanics like this

166
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,654
that will lead to better and great storytelling.

167
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:20,176
Another one along this line is the invention of Dungeons & Dragons in 1974.

168
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,998
This game could have been invented a thousand years ago.

169
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:27,460
The ancient Greeks could have invented this game.

170
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,141
They had 20-sided dice. I have seen them.

171
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:30,890
Right?

172
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,931
But they didn't.

173
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:33,692
It didn't show up until 1974.

174
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:38,737
No one thought to make a story game quite this way.

175
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:39,257
Somehow.

176
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:45,623
And I always wondered what was it about 1974 that made people think of it?

177
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,366
The weird part is I figured it out.

178
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:51,929
1972, Hunt the Wumpus showed up in college campuses all across the country.

179
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,901
And here was the first dungeon crawl adventure

180
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:59,543
where you could go and explore a dungeon in a single player game.

181
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,944
No one had done this before.

182
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:03,666
It was a week and it was thin, but it was a beginning

183
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,408
and it made people say,

184
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:07,389
oh my god, this is great.

185
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,091
What if this game was actually good?

186
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:13,654
What if a human being took the place of the computer?

187
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,476
And I think that has to be what inspired it.

188
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:19,138
Because otherwise this coincidence is insane.

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:29,165
And so here you have the case of a game mechanic that was inspired by technology, which is interesting.

190
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:36,170
Chris Swain from USC has an incredible prophecy about what will happen in the 21st century with games.

191
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:42,934
He argues that film was not taken seriously as a medium until it learned to talk.

192
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,757
It, when it was a silent medium, it was,

193
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:47,618
eh, it's kind of for kids, it's kind of silly,

194
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:50,799
we don't take it seriously, the stories aren't that great.

195
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,681
But once it learned to talk, it became the literature

196
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:56,062
of the 20th century, is the phrase that he uses.

197
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,203
Well, what are games waiting for?

198
00:10:58,203 --> 00:10:59,143
They can already talk.

199
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,084
We hear them talk all the time.

200
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,906
And he argues, no, they're waiting on something else.

201
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:06,107
They are waiting to learn to listen.

202
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:10,189
And that once games learn to listen

203
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:12,150
and have a conversation with the player.

204
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:17,260
that they will become the literature of the 21st century

205
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,401
is his argument.

206
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:20,622
And I suspect this may be dead on right.

207
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:24,704
That if, if we're going to have our Shakespeare of games, it's going to show up

208
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:25,085
this way.

209
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,647
So let's talk about some of the things that are standing in our way.

210
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:32,009
One of them is sensing emotion. This is coming. Here, take a look at this.

211
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:34,571
Using a program called Face API,

212
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:38,553
it's possible to track a person's facial features using nothing more than a

213
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:39,534
standard web camera.

214
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:44,907
In turn, we can use this information to drive the expression of a virtual character,

215
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:47,468
such as Breen here, taken from the game Half-Life 2.

216
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:54,652
This technology could allow players to accurately portray themselves online,

217
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,254
for use in multiplayer games or socialising applications.

218
00:11:57,254 --> 00:12:01,076
If you're interested in learning more about this technology,

219
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:04,277
or other related work I've done, please check out my website.

220
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,653
Okay, so puppeteering, that's cool.

221
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:11,954
Could be great for MMOs, could be great for social experiences.

222
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,954
But this same technology is what will make it possible

223
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:17,755
for a character to tell when you're surprised,

224
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:19,135
when you're yelling, when you're smiling,

225
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:22,316
when you're frowning, when you're frustrated.

226
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,657
We will be able to read that in a relatively short time.

227
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:26,517
Probably within 10 years,

228
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:30,358
this will be something that will be a normal part of gameplay.

229
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,358
So that's one.

230
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:33,719
So now the next one is words.

231
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,414
Now, words aren't new. Here we got, hey you Pikachu. What was this? 1996, I think.

232
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:40,115
You could talk to Pikachu and give him commands.

233
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:44,257
It was perfect, because Pikachu's a disobedient little cuss.

234
00:12:44,257 --> 00:12:47,979
And so, the fact that technology only worked 20% of the time,

235
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:49,720
actually was in character for him.

236
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,083
But now, you know, we've got, we've got Siri. Here, I'll do some Siri right here.

237
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,064
Right? Let's, let's, let's check it out here.

238
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:00,705
If I can do it right.

239
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:07,089
Merry Christmas, Siri.

240
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,732
Wait, Christmas isn't today.

241
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:12,633
It's on December 25th.

242
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,093
Right.

243
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:19,357
All right. So Siri knows what's going on, right.

244
00:13:19,357 --> 00:13:23,540
Understood me. No training. And like kind of formulated

245
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,342
in a semi-intelligent response. We are just at the

246
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:28,204
cusp where this is gonna start to be a

247
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:31,246
useful way to interact with games. But of course

248
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,508
words aren't enough. We actually have to have meaningful

249
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:36,190
understanding. It's sort of cool that Siri understood that,

250
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,832
but someone must have custom programmed that.

251
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,601
People say, oh my god, it's such an impossible problem.

252
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,641
We're never going to get there.

253
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:45,062
There have been people working on this for 30, 40 years,

254
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:46,082
and it's piling up.

255
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,482
It's going to, it's piling up, and it's

256
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:49,583
going to get to a point where suddenly we're

257
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,764
going to have systems that start to work.

258
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:54,464
And there's a picture of Alan Turing.

259
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:55,885
People talk about the Turing test.

260
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,605
Oh, it'll be so hard for, it's no good

261
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,286
unless it can really replicate a human.

262
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:06,071
Really? Like, have you ever seen C-3PO or Data on Star Trek?

263
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:11,276
They would not pass the Turing test, but it would be awesome to have a conversation with them.

264
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:15,199
It's okay to have characters that are intelligent, but not all the way there.

265
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,403
Even just a dog that would behave intelligently would be exciting.

266
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:22,726
Text adventures. What the heck happened?

267
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,813
This was gonna be it. This was a combination of novels and games.

268
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:30,574
The thing that was missing from text adventures that nobody talks about,

269
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:35,515
the reason I think the medium went away, it's not just because graphics are cool, right?

270
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:39,956
Books didn't go away when television showed up. They're still here.

271
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:45,157
The reason is that text adventures present a sort of a lie.

272
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:47,178
That prompt there says, type anything.

273
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,818
And there's all kinds of things you type.

274
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:51,541
99.99% of the things that you would type,

275
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,163
it's like, I have no idea what this is.

276
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:56,388
And so you play this game, and you're trying to figure out,

277
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:59,412
well, alright, what can this thing actually understand,

278
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:01,496
which doesn't feel very natural at all.

279
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:06,206
and that's going to start to change. We've got things like scribble knots.

280
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:11,610
Like what's fascinating to me about scribble knots, this thing has, you can type any noun.

281
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,915
Like, I think it supports 25,000 nouns. And like it shows up and you can use it.

282
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,377
You type bicycle, a bicycle shows up and you ride it around.

283
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:23,480
You type bear, a bear shows up and God shows up and an atomic bomb shows up.

284
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,703
And these things all work and function and do what they're supposed to.

285
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:30,946
If God's there and you also call up the devil, God starts punching the devil in the face.

286
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,968
Like everything is programmed and intelligent and that's cool

287
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:41,251
But what's cooler is each time they build a game they can build on what they've made before and the vocabulary gets larger and richer

288
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:47,313
Now guys let's talk about Milo remember Milo a few years ago, let's take a look at this and reflect on this

289
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:55,036
We've been experimenting with something here. I'd like you to meet a boy called Milo

290
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,997
He's a character

291
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:03,312
that can recognize us, he can recognize our faces, he can recognize our voices, he can recognize emotions in us.

292
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:07,413
And this is Claire, she's going to introduce you to Milo.

293
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,254
Hiya Milo, how you doing?

294
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:10,555
Hi Claire, you okay?

295
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,476
Actually I'm a bit nervous.

296
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:15,837
You? Nervous? I don't believe it.

297
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:20,119
This is the first time that thousands of people are going to see this.

298
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:20,900
Thousands of people?

299
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,354
Milo seems a little nervous too.

300
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:28,179
That may be because he was constructed of vapor and lies.

301
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:37,547
Right? Now that's... Right. We know that, because otherwise we'd be playing this game,

302
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:44,351
and instead it didn't happen. But that's fine. It's... Milo serves as a fascinating vision for

303
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:50,655
us to think about and aspire towards. The ability to have a one-on-one natural conversation with a

304
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:55,799
character is something we haven't quite gotten to yet, but it seems that within the next 10 years,

305
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,281
we should be able to do something like it.

306
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:04,988
And one of the things that's really important about Milo is he, you know, he's, he's got

307
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,291
the speech, but he's, he's got something else.

308
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,233
He's got something that this guy doesn't have.

309
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:15,158
Mario's a cool character, but he frustrates the hell out of me.

310
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:19,302
Because every time I get a new Mario game and I open it up and I put it in, you know,

311
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:23,045
and it starts out and he says, it's me, Mario!

312
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:23,786
Enter your name!

313
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:27,169
And I'm like, enter my name!

314
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:28,418
Mario, my god!

315
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:31,601
We've been playing games for 30 years!

316
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:35,705
You don't remember, man?

317
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:39,449
Don't you remember when we met at Vinny's Pizza Parlor?

318
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:44,013
Right? You and me. We took down Donkey Kong!

319
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,336
It took like six weeks, but we did it! It was awesome!

320
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,479
And you don't remember.

321
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,360
You don't know who I am, do you?

322
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:54,347
But, like, when Claire walks up to Milo, Milo's like,

323
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:54,908
oh, hey, Claire.

324
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:55,829
You know, how's it going?

325
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,952
He knows who she is, and he remembers.

326
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,496
Right now, we've just gotten to the point

327
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,040
where we have persistent databases for each game.

328
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:07,918
Why don't we have persistent databases for each character?

329
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:12,742
When I get a new game, why not have the characters remember what I did in the last game?

330
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:13,983
And be able to talk about it.

331
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:17,366
And be able to show me videos of the things that happened from last time.

332
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,428
That's going to happen.

333
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:21,589
But someone's going to have to make it happen.

334
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:24,211
And that memory is going to be really important.

335
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,075
And it's gonna happen in all kinds of games.

336
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,857
Because imagine if every game you played with Mario,

337
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:33,600
he like had this ongoing relationship with you

338
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,922
and he remembered all the things you did

339
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:37,103
from all the other games.

340
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:40,306
Now let's talk about talking to characters.

341
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:45,051
Because mostly when people talk about talking to characters

342
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:48,054
they assume, oh, we're gonna be talking to NPCs.

343
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,815
So let's look at, actually here's some talking

344
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:51,117
that happens in Mass Effect 3.

345
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,071
Place her in protective isolation.

346
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,493
Recommend gentle approach.

347
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:56,613
Krogan Sloth Trust.

348
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,414
I don't need her trust.

349
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,736
I'm Commander Shepard, Alliance Navy.

350
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,378
Are you here to kill me?

351
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:06,701
Of course not.

352
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,843
We're here to take you home.

353
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:09,324
Why?

354
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:12,446
What am I to you?

355
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:14,388
You're the Krogan's last hope.

356
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,890
You're the future of the Krogan race.

357
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,211
I'm fighting for that.

358
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,305
Now notice this relationship.

359
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:24,206
When I heard they were going to have voice in here,

360
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,507
I was like, this is going to be dumb.

361
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:26,967
Either I'm going to say it,

362
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,628
and the avatar is going to say it again,

363
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:29,228
which is stupid,

364
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:30,469
or I'm going to say it,

365
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,210
and Shepard's just going to stand there,

366
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:32,970
which is stupid.

367
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,511
But instead,

368
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:36,292
you say something,

369
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:38,573
and then Shepard follows up with something else.

370
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,457
as if, almost as if, we're two different people.

371
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:43,699
We're like a little team.

372
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,222
And I say something and he finishes my sentence.

373
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,223
Right?

374
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,906
And it's like we're buddies.

375
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:51,829
Which is a little weird.

376
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,112
We've not had that before.

377
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:56,134
That's a weird relationship with an avatar.

378
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:59,809
But is it such a weird relationship with an avatar?

379
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,491
This is the relationship we've always had.

380
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,073
You control an avatar and run them around.

381
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:06,034
And then, oh, cut scene.

382
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:07,615
And he does some stuff.

383
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:08,516
And he's gone.

384
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:09,097
There he goes.

385
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:09,457
All right.

386
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:10,017
All right.

387
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:11,158
And now it's me again.

388
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:11,619
It's him.

389
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:11,899
It's me.

390
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:12,600
It's him.

391
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,220
It's me.

392
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,361
We shift back and forth.

393
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:15,762
We're comfortable with this.

394
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:17,944
So it's not too surprising when it happens here.

395
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:22,496
So what I'm arguing is, even though everyone imagines that who you're going to talk to

396
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:27,720
in these games are the NPCs, the quest givers, and sure, you're going to talk to them a little

397
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,363
bit, but I think the one you're going to talk to the most are going to be your avatar.

398
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:37,387
There's no facility in Mass Effect 3 to have a little chat with Shepard after that character

399
00:20:37,387 --> 00:20:39,209
leaves, but like, you sure would want to.

400
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:42,451
You know, man, that alien jerk, what the hell was that?

401
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,392
I know, I know, are you kidding me?

402
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:44,773
Right?

403
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:46,354
You'd want to have that conversation.

404
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,748
And so I think avatar is gonna start to be the wrong word.

405
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:52,849
And I'm envisioning a different word.

406
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:55,792
Virtual companions is the word I start to think of.

407
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:57,654
This character who's there with you,

408
00:20:57,654 --> 00:20:59,475
and sometimes you're controlling,

409
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:04,020
and you're working together as a team.

410
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,821
Now, when I was a boy,

411
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:08,664
I went on a long drive with my father one time.

412
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:10,906
And it's all quiet in the car, we're just sitting there.

413
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:12,768
And all of a sudden he says,

414
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:19,976
If you had a friend who was a ghost,

415
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:23,238
how old would you want them to be?

416
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:28,323
And I thought about it, and I said, well, I'm seven.

417
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,205
So I think seven, so we could play and stuff.

418
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:34,548
And he said, yeah, yeah.

419
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:38,191
The thing is, though, you're going to get older,

420
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,772
and he's not.

421
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:42,955
And I said, oh, oh, yeah, I never thought about that.

422
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:51,654
He said, yeah, that's why you got to think about these things.

423
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:53,957
But it turns out we do have to think about these things.

424
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:54,878
Because that's a question.

425
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:58,202
Normally, avatars are made for a certain age and games made for a certain age.

426
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:03,851
And if we change and go away, we're going to lose that character and leave them behind.

427
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:07,354
We're going to want these characters to change with us.

428
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,696
Change and grow as we change and grow.

429
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:17,163
Which will be a huge challenge for us as designers, but damn, if you can do that, that is powerful.

430
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:18,484
That will be very powerful.

431
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,105
People may have read Ender's Game. There's an aspect of Ender's Game nobody talks about, which is the fantasy game in there.

432
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:30,889
There's this game that people play. It's like going into a little bit of a dream.

433
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:33,571
You enter this little fantasy world. It's very dreamlike.

434
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:38,175
And the adults in the game call it the mind game or the psychology game,

435
00:22:38,175 --> 00:22:45,060
because it's designed to kind of help you confront the problems that you have, but like in game form.

436
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,803
And the game sort of susses out what problems you have.

437
00:22:48,303 --> 00:22:51,025
And there's a quote in here, you know, Ender said, one point says,

438
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:55,868
this game knows me too well and he can't, he can't, he can't face what he's dealing with.

439
00:22:55,868 --> 00:22:59,150
And imagine being able to create a story that is,

440
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,992
where you have so much data about the player and what they like and what they're into,

441
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:08,836
that you can craft a story that is like just perfect for where they are age-wise and development-wise and interest-wise.

442
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:12,038
That would be really, really powerful.

443
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,037
So what platform is all this stuff gonna happen on?

444
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:17,699
Everyone wants to know, what platform, what platform?

445
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,019
Where are the story games gonna be?

446
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,141
What's the right platform for story games?

447
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:22,502
Because I'll tell you right now,

448
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,823
all platforms are not created equal when it comes to story.

449
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:28,206
And the right answer is, stop thinking about platforms.

450
00:23:28,746 --> 00:23:30,607
Platforms are the wrong way to think about the world.

451
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:32,729
You should think about the world instead in terms of venues,

452
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:33,330
right?

453
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,512
Where people use things, because that's

454
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:38,213
going to stay the same.

455
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,475
Where people use stuff will not change.

456
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,277
It is a rock you can build around.

457
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:45,499
The platforms will change, but the venues won't.

458
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:47,621
So here's the four venues of the home.

459
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:49,102
One of them is the hearth, right?

460
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:52,144
This is the living room where the family gathers to kind of

461
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:53,626
do these sort of public things.

462
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:57,245
The second one is just kind of anywhere, the in-between space.

463
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,767
This is where people play mobile games right now.

464
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:00,787
It's a crappy place for stories.

465
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,269
There's the reading nook.

466
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,731
This is when I want to be really alone and really private

467
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:08,072
and by myself, and it's quiet, and it's very quiet,

468
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,774
and this is obviously a good place for stories.

469
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:12,115
And then a fourth one is the workbench.

470
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:14,277
This is where I'm going to go.

471
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:16,438
I've got a thing I want to achieve and accomplish.

472
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,219
This is where PC gaming lives.

473
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,722
People treat PC gaming differently than these other

474
00:24:21,722 --> 00:24:24,183
places because it's workbench mentality.

475
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:26,405
I'm going to do this hard thing, and I'm going to dig in,

476
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:26,945
and I'm going to drill in.

477
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,087
It's different than the reading nook.

478
00:24:29,087 --> 00:24:30,248
It's different than the hearth.

479
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:33,110
So when people say, we're going to bring steam to the

480
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,811
living room, really?

481
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:38,654
Is that really what you want to do?

482
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:39,054
No.

483
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:43,097
What you want to do is make an easier way to have steam in

484
00:24:43,097 --> 00:24:43,998
the workbench.

485
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,138
So where's good for stories?

486
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:51,129
No, not anywhere. Anywhere is bad for stories. That's why story games don't work very well on mobile.

487
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:54,271
And the hearth is okay, but not good for story games.

488
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:57,754
Because it's boring to watch somebody else's story game.

489
00:24:57,754 --> 00:25:00,455
The Reading Nook and the Workbench are the places.

490
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:03,377
What are their, what are their respective platforms?

491
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:07,980
The Reading Nook wants tablets, and the Workbench wants something like the PC.

492
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,502
But what? Will it continue to be the PC? Is the PC going away? I think I'll tell you what's coming.

493
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:18,903
This son of a bitch is coming.

494
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:25,426
HMDs are gonna come back. And you know what they're good for? They are good for storytelling.

495
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,787
because they are incredibly intimate.

496
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:33,329
There's just you and the world, and you are just in there.

497
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:35,510
And there's nobody else in there.

498
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,992
I think our rich, I suspect in the next 10 years,

499
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:41,733
our richest story games are gonna show up in this medium.

500
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:45,315
And note, this does not belong in the living room.

501
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:48,116
This is a workbench or a reading nook medium.

502
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,837
This is not a living room medium.

503
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,812
Okay, so how do we do?

504
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:54,553
Rich verbs.

505
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,674
Well, here in the future, I think it's gonna come.

506
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,416
If we can talk to characters,

507
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,998
suddenly we got above the neck verbs, and it's exciting.

508
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:04,121
How are we doing on the tragedy?

509
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:07,344
Well, I think if you've got a virtual companion

510
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,886
who's been with you for 10, 15 years,

511
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:13,049
and something horrible happens to them,

512
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,791
and they get killed, or they just get sick of you

513
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,714
and they leave because they're fed up with your crap,

514
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:19,474
oh my God.

515
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,617
Right? That would be, you would have tragedy in games and it would be freaking powerful.

516
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:31,184
How about unification? Everything coming together. Is technology going to fix this? I'm not so

517
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:33,947
sure about that. That's still a hard unsolved problem.

518
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,124
So does that mean we can't, can we have a Shakespeare of games?

519
00:26:39,124 --> 00:26:41,667
And I think that we can.

520
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:45,932
But I think our Shakespeare is not going to be so much a teller of tales,

521
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:48,835
although they will be a teller of tales, but they

522
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:51,078
will be a crafter of characters.

523
00:26:51,939 --> 00:26:55,461
Someone will have the understanding of human psychology

524
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:58,043
to make a character that you will bond with

525
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:00,324
and want to stay with and want to have part of your life

526
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:03,586
on all of your platforms, across all of your games,

527
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,427
and a companion through life.

528
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:07,729
Think about how when you chose a username,

529
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:10,511
when you were, I don't know what, 14 probably,

530
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,812
and how you still have it today,

531
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:15,414
and you will probably still have it when you're 65,

532
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:18,116
because that's the way we craft identity.

533
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,478
Think about how those little toys that you put on your little cubicle

534
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,840
are the same ones you had when you were eight.

535
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,901
You're gonna have the same virtual companion

536
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:28,143
who goes with you through your whole life.

537
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:28,904
Now, what happens when we die?

538
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,461
What are we gonna do with these characters?

539
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:37,581
Think about World of Warcraft.

540
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,222
World of Warcraft's got 10 years on it.

541
00:27:39,222 --> 00:27:41,022
That game's not going anywhere.

542
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:43,703
It's gonna be there 20 years, 30 years.

543
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,843
What should we do with the characters when the players die?

544
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:50,784
Should we bury them and have a little funeral service?

545
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:56,105
Or maybe, should we pass them on to our descendants?

546
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:59,346
And think about a world where the best way

547
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,566
to get to know your ancestors

548
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:04,227
is by inheriting their virtual companions.

549
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:07,865
because the companions will be able to tell you the stories

550
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:10,907
about everything this person ever did and all the good times they had

551
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:16,430
and everything that happened of your grandfather and great-grandfather

552
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,651
because these will get passed down a long, long time.

553
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:24,366
And I know that sounds kind of weird and it sounds kind of sci-fi,

554
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:27,867
but tell me how this will not happen.

555
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:31,328
This is exactly what will and must happen.

556
00:28:31,328 --> 00:28:33,009
And who's going to make it?

557
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:34,169
It's going to be us.

558
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:37,090
This stuff's not going to come from Google or wherever,

559
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,591
it's going to come from game developers

560
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,631
who figure this out and who crack this,

561
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,292
because we're there first.

562
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,492
Was Siri there first? No.

563
00:28:43,492 --> 00:28:46,353
Hey You Pikachu was there first with this stuff.

564
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,314
We're going to be out there first,

565
00:28:48,314 --> 00:28:51,115
and these game characters are going to weave into our regular lives.

566
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:55,913
And it may well be that we spend a lot of time

567
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:57,335
talking to these virtual companions,

568
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,516
because why would you just talk to them in the game?

569
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:00,778
Why not just be like,

570
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:02,459
hey Mario, what's the weather tomorrow?

571
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:03,340
And he'll tell you all about it,

572
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,303
because he's used to talking to you anyway.

573
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:09,525
We may spend more time talking to these virtual characters

574
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:12,047
than we talk to anyone else.

575
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:13,348
And that doesn't sound healthy.

576
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,831
Right? And maybe it's not, and it's one of these things we're gonna have to work with and figure out.

577
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:27,214
So while it may have some downsides, I still continue to believe that having somebody who's there with you,

578
00:29:27,214 --> 00:29:34,516
and who cares about you, and is willing to just be with you all along your journey, no matter what,

579
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:38,518
has to have some value. So I'll end up by leaving you with this.

580
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:43,959
Goodbye, Sarah.

581
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:57,162
And remember, Fair Maiden, should you need us...

582
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,124
Yes, should you need us, for any reason at all...

583
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:03,226
I need you, Huggle.

584
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:03,526
You do?

585
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:16,194
I don't know why, but every now and again in my life, for no reason at all...

586
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:23,943
I need you. All of you.

587
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:25,445
Oh, you do?

588
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:26,687
Well, why didn't you say so?

589
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:32,576
Thank you very much everybody. Have a great GDC!
