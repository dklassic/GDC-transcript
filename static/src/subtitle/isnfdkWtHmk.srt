1
00:00:02,964 --> 00:00:03,804
You guys ready to get started?

2
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:05,666
Hey, Lee!

3
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:08,189
Awesome. Well, welcome.

4
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:14,816
It's a privilege to be here on behalf of our amazing development teams in Seattle and in Alaska

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,899
to represent a very special project called Never Alone.

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,464
It's so good to see a few friendly faces in the crowd.

7
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:26,716
And I'm happy to be here spending time with you today

8
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:30,438
to describe quite a special project that we've been on

9
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,618
for the last two and a half years.

10
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:33,959
Quick show of hands, how many of you

11
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:35,120
have heard of Never Alone?

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,120
Amazing.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,181
OK, this is going to go great.

14
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,021
How many of you played the game?

15
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:41,222
All right.

16
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:42,602
How many of you finished the game?

17
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:43,963
All right.

18
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:45,063
OK, good.

19
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:46,204
We're doing good.

20
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:57,631
We've been learning a whole new way of making games and have experienced a depth of purpose of game development that none of us ever thought was possible.

21
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:02,395
So it's incredibly exciting to be here among peers to share a little bit about that experience.

22
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,396
I recognize that everyone's very busy today.

23
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:06,417
There are a lot of amazing talks going on.

24
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:09,720
So I'm going to give a quick overview of what we're going to be focusing on today.

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,741
We're going to introduce Never Alone

26
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:15,003
and the people who inspired the creation of the game.

27
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,065
We're going to focus on the game's visual style.

28
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,766
I have a very special guest here today who's going to take the bulk of the talk.

29
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:24,189
We're going to discuss how we achieved true infusion of a culture in a game

30
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,732
and discuss the impact that the game has had around the world.

31
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:29,693
My name is Sean Vessi.

32
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:31,675
I'm the creative director on the project.

33
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:37,441
If you had told me at any point over the last 20 years while I was working on games about

34
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:41,924
blowing shit up, I would have told you that someday I'd have the opportunity to do something

35
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:46,407
that I love to do, make games, but make games that have lasting, meaningful impact, I would

36
00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:47,527
have told you you were crazy.

37
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:51,250
So it's a bit surreal for me to be here talking about the adventure we've been on.

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,493
I'm here today and I'm happy that you to meet a colleague and a good friend of mine, Dima

39
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:57,634
Varjovka, our art director.

40
00:01:57,714 --> 00:01:58,014
Hey guys.

41
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:03,582
Dima worked tirelessly to appropriately represent the spirit of a people.

42
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:07,947
He and the rest of our team became students of their culture and traditions,

43
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,332
and he managed to develop a truly signature visual style

44
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:15,956
that's garnered a tremendous amount of attention from players around the world.

45
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:20,761
I'd also like to introduce you to, virtually, to a woman named Gloria O'Neill.

46
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:25,085
She is the President and CEO of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council.

47
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:32,373
She and her leadership team should be credited with the original vision of creating a game

48
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:37,438
to share and extend her culture's mythology, values, and worldviews.

49
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,120
And she challenged us.

50
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,704
to make a game that would catalyze the curiosity of a modern gaming audience

51
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,567
to develop a hunger to learn about world culture.

52
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:49,529
And that's what we set off to do two and a half years ago.

53
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,274
We're members of E-Line and a newly formed company called Upper One Games.

54
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:56,836
We develop games for evolving minds.

55
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:01,120
We believe that games can offer curious gamers

56
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,041
eager to expand their worldview,

57
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,764
fun, entertaining experiences.

58
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,107
And the kinds of games that we want to make

59
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:12,209
require being adept at forging lasting partnerships.

60
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,752
These are a few of the groups, the foundations,

61
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:17,014
and organizations who we work with on a regular basis.

62
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,896
Folks like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,

63
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,098
the Public Broadcasting System,

64
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:23,319
the Smithsonian.

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,702
But one of the deepest and most meaningful partnerships that we forged recently is with

66
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:36,564
the Cook Inlet Tribal Council, who introduced us to over 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers,

67
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:38,484
artists, and social entrepreneurs.

68
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:41,245
These people are featured in the game through Cultural Insights.

69
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:46,347
You get to hear from their voice aspects of their culture that are contextually relevant

70
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:47,687
to the gameplay that gamers play.

71
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:53,868
These ambassadors gave us their time, their experience, and their wisdom, and most importantly, their trust.

72
00:03:54,528 --> 00:04:03,893
And we took that trust very seriously. It was a serious responsibility that we felt that we had as game developers to uphold their values and to create a game that would make their community proud.

73
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:08,496
And we're tremendously grateful for the opportunity to have such wonderful, creative collaborators.

74
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:18,001
I'm going to play a quick trailer for those of you who may not have seen it to get a sense for kind of what we were after in making the game.

75
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:31,342
Don't do it!

76
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:16,289
So many of you may not know this, but the game's fiction is based on an Inupiaq legend

77
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,810
called Kunuk Sayuka.

78
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:24,095
It was passed down for generations and told to us through the oldest living relative of

79
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,696
a man named Robert Nasrik Cleveland.

80
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:26,757
He's the man pictured here.

81
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:33,741
He was a master storyteller who died in the 70s, but he passed down the story of an endless

82
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,122
blizzard and a young protagonist.

83
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:38,285
who goes out in the world to find the source of the blizzard

84
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,868
and ends up being challenged to restore balance to nature.

85
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,470
The game explores the theme of interdependence.

86
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,052
It's a central value of the Inupiaq.

87
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,694
And it's explored through the two main characters

88
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,376
of the Inupiaq girl and her unlikely companion,

89
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,177
an arctic fox.

90
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:54,938
Each have respective skills and abilities

91
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,300
that they have to work together to overcome obstacles.

92
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,702
At this point, I want to turn it over to Dima,

93
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:02,204
who's going to discuss the visual style of the game.

94
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:04,106
Thank you, Sean.

95
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,844
I'm happy to be here, guys.

96
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:12,347
And before I start to talk about the visual style,

97
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:18,531
I would like to go a little bit and tell about my background.

98
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:22,453
So I've been in the industry more than 15 years now,

99
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:26,756
working on different kind of games for various platforms.

100
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:30,858
But I've never been part of such an amazing project

101
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,659
as Never Alone.

102
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,160
It's truly a creative project.

103
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:42,640
My background, I'm a traditional artist, and to find a project like that is really something special.

104
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,301
I grew up in Odessa, Ukraine, which is like a beautiful place on the Black Sea.

105
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:55,623
I graduated from St. Petersburg Academy of Art with a master's degree in fine art and architecture design.

106
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:59,803
Early days of my career, I started to work like a...

107
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,557
game designer, sculpting toys for various clients.

108
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:10,442
One of them, like lots of them, it was Disney.

109
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:12,324
I worked with Hasbro.

110
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:37,014
metal and many more. And I come to the realization that if I can do it in clay, why can't I do it on a computer. And I learned the computer and the first job was at Zuper Interactive, back then it was a small company. And I've been a key member and I started working as a character artist and become a lead artist running a bigger team there.

111
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:43,416
Work on titles like Solcom, the entire Solcom series, Mac,

112
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:44,477
unit 13.

113
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,199
And now I'm happy where I am.

114
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,281
I'm working at Eli Media, working on games like Never

115
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,422
Alone, culture games.

116
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:57,347
So let's talk about the visual style now.

117
00:08:58,628 --> 00:08:59,348
What is important?

118
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:02,671
Like any new project you start, you need to be inspired first.

119
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:05,893
Like you really need to know what you want to talk about.

120
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,254
So you need to set some goals.

121
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:12,910
In our case, it's probably everyone wants to make a game

122
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,491
really beautiful, special, to find some kind of a special,

123
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,772
unique look that stands out from the slew of games coming

124
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:21,552
out every year.

125
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:25,933
But most important thing, because this game is about

126
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:29,914
people, about certain culture, this visual style needs to

127
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,174
reflect the culture.

128
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:33,315
Needs to reflect the people.

129
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:34,515
We need to reflect what they're.

130
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:43,902
motivation, what their values are, and the other thing is important to kind of capture the beauty of the place where they live.

131
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:52,787
And kind of more, the third one is like universal, but like any visual design you do, they need to support the actual design of the game.

132
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:56,690
And to support and extend the gameplay experience.

133
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:12,325
But first, before saying how you want to really create the game, what you really want to put there, you need to figure out who first, and then figure out how to do that.

134
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:17,708
Because lots of people, including me back then when I worked in another company, just...

135
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,814
You're thinking how to create the shader, some kind of a

136
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:25,538
special subsurface scattering here and stuff like that.

137
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,819
But you're really not thinking why you're doing all that.

138
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,201
It might be not necessary, what kind of message you

139
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:30,942
wanted to deliver.

140
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:36,066
And to us, because the message is about the culture, we really

141
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:38,107
need to go and study who these people are.

142
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:47,888
I'm going to give you really basic information, something that you probably can find online.

143
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:51,011
And it's important to understand who these people are.

144
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,092
They live in Inupiaq.

145
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:54,835
It's Inupiaq people, Inupiaq culture.

146
00:10:55,735 --> 00:11:00,380
They live all the way up north in Alaska, at the very, very top.

147
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:05,785
And it's total, like around 12,000 people live up there.

148
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,695
Live in a harsh environment.

149
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:13,297
Like average temperature in the winter, minus 21 degrees.

150
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:16,038
It's like, it's not that it's average.

151
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:17,618
That means sometimes it's minus 50.

152
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,659
First time we went there, it was minus 35.

153
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,980
And it's cold.

154
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,741
Like, I live like in St. Petersburg.

155
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,202
I never experienced that cold ever.

156
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:30,323
So like, it's like minus 35, you don't know what to do.

157
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:33,364
It's like five minutes outside, you don't,

158
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:34,605
you want to go inside.

159
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,355
But how these people live, they're still practicing

160
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:43,556
like subsistence living.

161
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:44,397
So they hunt.

162
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:47,500
And it's two different groups.

163
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,701
Like one of them live on the coastal, the other people live

164
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:50,602
like inland.

165
00:11:51,301 --> 00:12:00,488
And based on where they live, people from Kostel, they harvest seals, whales, all sorts

166
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:02,249
of sea animals.

167
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:07,252
And people from inland, they harvest caribou, different types of birds.

168
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:14,137
What's very special about these people that we kind of like noticed, and that's something

169
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:19,041
that we wanted to put in the game and translate that, these people incredibly...

170
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:21,443
War.

171
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:26,827
Like, they, like, because even though they live there, their hospitality, like every

172
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,789
time we come there, they just, like, invite us to their houses.

173
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:36,254
And willing to share their wisdom with us, willing to tell their stories.

174
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:38,876
So for us, it's like, it becomes like almost our family.

175
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:45,981
And also, like, these people have very rich and incredible tradition of storytelling.

176
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,403
That's something, like, we're like, okay, that's worth to tell.

177
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,185
That's worth to, like, share the stories.

178
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,192
I jumped here, but I will say that's the Barrow.

179
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:00,174
Barrow is like, that's the first place when we went there.

180
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,015
It's Barrow, Alaska.

181
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,175
That's where we went.

182
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,957
It's like the most northern place in Alaska.

183
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:09,378
It's like 5,000 people live there.

184
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,500
You can imagine, that's where Seattle, that's

185
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,441
where we travel from, all the way up there.

186
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,702
Like when people say, when are you going again to Alaska?

187
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:19,563
I'm saying, it's not just Alaska.

188
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,304
It's to Barrow.

189
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,365
And it's very necessary to pull out your phone

190
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:23,525
and to show where it is.

191
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,131
Because we went to Alaska 12 times, we went to Barrow three times, and it's a special experience.

192
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:33,572
We went first time in the winter, and it was dark.

193
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,113
It all, like the whole day dark.

194
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:40,674
It was a window of like maybe two hours when the sun rise, and then you go to the, we went to pizza,

195
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:44,075
and then like another hour and the sun goes down.

196
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,196
You're like, okay, that's it, that's it.

197
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:50,283
Something that you can't experience anywhere else.

198
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:51,504
And then we went in May.

199
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,506
That's the picture I took.

200
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:54,767
That's one picture.

201
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:55,588
It's 2 PM.

202
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,470
And the other one is 2 AM.

203
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,853
It's like light all day.

204
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,575
It's like stepping out onto the planet Hoth.

205
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:05,376
Exactly.

206
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:07,678
It's just like you're in a different world.

207
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,021
What we did over there.

208
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:16,778
We met with elders, first of all. Elders, there's a huge respect there for elders.

209
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:25,226
And people like, the image that you see here is like Sean talking to Nene Gray.

210
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:30,991
She is one of the daughters of Robert Cleveland. He is the storyteller.

211
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:37,733
And what we did there, we would talk to them, we kind of trying to get like what the essence

212
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,276
we wanted, like what's important about the culture.

213
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:45,100
Because what's on the surface everybody understands, yeah they hunt, they do certain things, but

214
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,161
for us it wasn't the goal.

215
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:50,646
We really wanted to show something special, something that they potentially can lose.

216
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:52,728
And that's their spirituality.

217
00:14:55,236 --> 00:15:00,582
And we also talked to kids, because kids, like, talking to kids is always fun.

218
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:02,505
You're asking them, like, what's your favorite story?

219
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,387
Tell us the story that you really like.

220
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:10,294
Because we were looking what, to find the right story, story that we can tell in a game.

221
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:14,179
And kids told us lots and lots of stories that...

222
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,361
Help us to kind of understand what is important to them.

223
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,682
What is the character there?

224
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,743
Like, for example, one of the characters, like little people,

225
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:23,464
it came straight from them.

226
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:26,205
Like, we were asking, like, what do you want to talk?

227
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:29,666
Like, tell us, like, the character that you want.

228
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,887
Like, what's the special kind of a character?

229
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,708
And all of them, like, it's a little people.

230
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,469
Be afraid of them.

231
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,689
They live somewhere around us.

232
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,890
It was interesting.

233
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,527
So what also we did, we met with artists.

234
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,649
I personally, I mean, because I'm artist in my background,

235
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,270
like I am a sculptor.

236
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,511
So to me, meeting the people that I,

237
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:51,473
I was introduced to the Inupiaq art, to Inuit art,

238
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:53,874
way back when I was in academy.

239
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,936
And I also carved in a soapstone to see actually,

240
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,297
and meet people who behind the scenes,

241
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,858
so like to meet with them and talk.

242
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:03,479
It was an amazing experience.

243
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,120
So that's on this image.

244
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,141
It's John Huffley, a really good artist.

245
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:10,422
He showed me his latest work, and we

246
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:14,483
talk about overall what's important for him,

247
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:16,644
and kind of like he shared the ideas.

248
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:20,405
That all gave us the ideas, what we wanted to put in the game,

249
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:21,886
what we wanted to translate in the game.

250
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:23,846
We researched the art.

251
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,827
And if you look at the art, like,

252
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,391
Just what stands out?

253
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:31,333
Stands out like they have like very original composition.

254
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,275
They're using like unique materials,

255
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:35,557
materials that's only in that land,

256
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:37,739
like ivory or baleen.

257
00:16:38,219 --> 00:16:39,260
They're mixing materials.

258
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:41,402
But the most important thing,

259
00:16:41,442 --> 00:16:43,484
what actually stands out to me,

260
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:48,268
is the quality, the really like handcrafted quality,

261
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:48,949
every piece.

262
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:56,048
You feel the love, you feel the warm hands of the people, the creators, the artists.

263
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:04,155
And even though we're creating the game and it's digital, one of the big goals is to bring

264
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:05,476
this quality into the game.

265
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:12,020
We don't want a digital kind of like impress somebody, look how it's glowing, look at this

266
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:12,401
effect.

267
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:14,783
We really wanted to bring this love into the game.

268
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,285
And it was like one of the goals.

269
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:26,183
We talked to the scientist, and that's Aaron Crowell, amazing guy.

270
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:29,966
He studied Alaska and Alaskan people 20 years.

271
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:31,107
And we were lucky.

272
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:34,050
We went behind the scenes in the Smithsonian Museum in Anchorage.

273
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,753
He showed us different tools, explained to us how people live, too.

274
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,975
It was very, very interesting.

275
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,577
And we participated in a community event.

276
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:47,380
Like, just by looking at this image, you're probably thinking, like, what is that?

277
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,201
What's going on there?

278
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:54,510
We were lucky, it's not happens every day, but we arrived with Sean and the same day

279
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:55,772
they caught the whale.

280
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:59,999
It was 2 o'clock in the morning, even though it's bright, that's how 2 o'clock in the morning

281
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,440
looks like.

282
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:10,096
We were part of that, so we're pulling the whale with the community, 40 feet bowhead whale, and celebrating with them.

283
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:14,737
It's like everyone there on the snow, kids, elders, everyone.

284
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,218
It was very amazing.

285
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:25,240
Like, I can talk one hour just about that, because all my friends, they're asking specifically that part.

286
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,781
We try Muck Talk. Muck Talk is a whale blubber.

287
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:34,375
The way they cook it, they just throw it in the snow and it sits there for an hour and

288
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,477
it's ready to eat.

289
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,379
It was interesting too.

290
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,342
So we got inspired.

291
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:42,626
It was like all these trips gave us inspiration.

292
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,589
That's something that I said at the very beginning.

293
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,590
Inspiration.

294
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,331
We got that.

295
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,594
The next step, mood board.

296
00:18:49,614 --> 00:18:51,956
So we need to, like, I really like to, like,

297
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:55,440
it's a lot of thousands, pictures, videos,

298
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,821
so we put everything on the wall.

299
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:57,802
It's a long wall.

300
00:18:57,842 --> 00:19:00,264
That's one of the examples how the wall looks like.

301
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:02,026
And we look at that, what stands out?

302
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:02,867
What is important?

303
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:05,289
What we really wanted to tell, how, what's,

304
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,171
like the colors, right?

305
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:09,713
The northern lights, something really special

306
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:10,634
just need to be there.

307
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:12,276
People.

308
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:14,920
Wearing traditional clothing, for sure, yes.

309
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:19,247
And clothing, like, it's all fur and animals.

310
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:22,993
We, like, art, the traditional art.

311
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:26,619
All that need to be in the game.

312
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,420
How to do that?

313
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,950
Let's find out.

314
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,173
So that's one of the first images I drew,

315
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:34,555
but it's kind of a special image to me

316
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:37,156
because that's the image that kind of gave us the direction.

317
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:40,279
That's the image that's connecting the real world

318
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,901
and the spirit world.

319
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:44,582
It's surreal.

320
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:47,724
It's not like how we did the spirits in the game,

321
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:50,587
but this picture has the soul.

322
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:53,909
It's something that we're like, OK, I

323
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,170
wanted to make a game like that.

324
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,071
So it was a very important one.

325
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,708
The second one also, like it's desaturated, the water, because

326
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:05,829
it's a lot of water there, how it looks like the boat, water,

327
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,569
and for the contrast, the white fox.

328
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,891
This image, I don't know how many people saw, but that's the

329
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,511
image of an ice floe in the shape of a whale.

330
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:22,112
The reason why, because in European people, they really

331
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:26,713
believe everything alive, everything has a soul, and land

332
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,513
because it's all like.

333
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:36,755
And in this case, I tried to imagine how, if that's an ice

334
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,975
lull, how they will move.

335
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,576
And they don't necessarily need to move like ice lulls,

336
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,757
because they have a soul.

337
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:43,637
They can move some kind of different.

338
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,419
Also, the beautiful water of Arctic Ocean,

339
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,520
you can't pass that.

340
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,741
It's just amazing colors.

341
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:52,921
We have that in the game, too.

342
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:55,142
And that's one of the first images

343
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:55,962
when we start to draw.

344
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:03,817
Just the idea of how the village looks like, what's in the village, what's the structure there.

345
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:11,225
We researched two pigs, what kind of boats they have, and kind of the first understanding how to make the characters, what kind of style.

346
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:15,929
So that's important work, right?

347
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:18,511
I show you five images, and now I

348
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:20,052
know what kind of game I wanted to make.

349
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:23,474
It's important to go through that process.

350
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,236
So what we want to do, we want atmospheric to capture

351
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:27,577
tundra, the space.

352
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:29,578
We want a soft rendering.

353
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,121
We want authentic colors.

354
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,963
We're basically using the colors that's there from ice, from

355
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:36,303
water.

356
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:41,295
And handcrafted feel, the one that's very important to me,

357
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:43,676
that I said, because this love needs to be

358
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:44,857
translated into the game.

359
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:46,558
That's important quality.

360
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:52,521
That image we took in May, that's how Tundra looks like.

361
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:57,443
Amazing, beautiful, atmospheric, moody.

362
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:00,425
But wait, we're making the platform a game.

363
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:04,916
Good luck to make the platform a game in that environment.

364
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,657
There's just really nothing there, right?

365
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:09,238
Like it's no variety.

366
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,481
OK, what I'm going to do?

367
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,142
What you really want, you want that.

368
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:19,485
You want something to jump on, to jump off.

369
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:23,548
You work out how to get it.

370
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:23,888
It's ice.

371
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:24,349
It's gray.

372
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:29,646
So we were really lucky.

373
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,388
We started to research the Inupiaq land

374
00:22:31,508 --> 00:22:33,069
and we find this place.

375
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,851
It's called King Island.

376
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:37,473
King Island is a fishing village.

377
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,594
It's built on the steep slopes.

378
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:42,256
It's built on the island on the steep slopes.

379
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,558
And it's just amazing.

380
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:45,739
Look at the structure.

381
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,781
Looks really interesting.

382
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,702
Something that I didn't see before.

383
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:51,884
And it's perfect for platform.

384
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:53,285
It's like a platform, right?

385
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,087
Like you're like, yeah, we want to use this.

386
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:56,047
That's great.

387
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:02,394
The other thing is this. Trees. But the thing is, like, first

388
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:04,595
when we started the project, everybody said, like, oh, it's

389
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:09,117
no trees there. It's like, it's too north, too far north, no

390
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:13,099
trees. But actually, in Nupiak land, because it's so big,

391
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,961
inland, they have the area called Anaktuvik Pass. And

392
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:20,242
Anaktuvik Pass, actually, they do have trees. That's the image

393
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:23,024
of Anaktuvik Pass. That's where it's located. It's between

394
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,425
River, Anaktuvik, and John River.

395
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:34,055
The way actually our story, the person who translated the story, he is from Anaktuvik

396
00:23:34,075 --> 00:23:34,356
Pass.

397
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:40,719
And we were happy about that so we can use branches as platforms.

398
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,741
And iSlow, of course.

399
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:45,202
Just look at this image.

400
00:23:45,262 --> 00:23:46,263
Isn't that inspirational?

401
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:49,745
Just by looking at the image like that, somebody said, make a game about this.

402
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:54,207
It's easy to make a beautiful game just by looking at the image.

403
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:56,729
It's colors coming out, it's atmosphere.

404
00:23:57,926 --> 00:24:02,788
different shapes. For us it's like a clay. You can build whatever. It's a sculpture in the water.

405
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,770
And for designers it's like they can do whatever they want.

406
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:10,853
It's like really good material to work with.

407
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,634
So we found the locations.

408
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:17,785
And we start the project kind of like, OK, we know where we go.

409
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:18,686
We know what we want.

410
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:20,989
We know what kind of colors we wanted to do.

411
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:22,891
And that's the image on top.

412
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:25,274
That's real images from Bearer.

413
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:27,917
And below, that's kind of the image from the game,

414
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:29,258
early image from the game.

415
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:32,162
But important to have kind of a palette.

416
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:33,603
Like I don't want to, like when.

417
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:38,440
I give the, like we're working and trying to figure out like the range of the colors.

418
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,522
You not go and use like all the colors in the world.

419
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:44,084
Like you really like that's my range, that's what I'm going to use.

420
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:46,186
So for Tundra that was the range.

421
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:48,068
And we start the process.

422
00:24:49,228 --> 00:24:50,610
So that's how the game looks like.

423
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,012
Like at the very beginning it just looked like that.

424
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:57,595
Oh, sorry.

425
00:24:58,956 --> 00:24:59,757
What's happened?

426
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:01,438
Hang on one second, sorry guys.

427
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:13,184
We crashed the system. It was awesome. Awesome. Covered. So

428
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:16,806
That's how we start. The game built in 3D, that's important.

429
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:18,807
Like, we used Unity, we didn't know Unity.

430
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:23,390
We started the project, it was two artists, me and a really good friend of mine, Casey McDonald.

431
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,332
And we'd never, I mean, all my experience is 3D games.

432
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:28,913
I don't know how to do 3D games.

433
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:32,576
And we choose, okay, let's learn at least one thing, Unity.

434
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:34,817
Let's not figure out how to do 2D games.

435
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:37,438
So we use 3D.

436
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:38,799
And that's how it looks.

437
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,021
It's not bad from the beginning, but how you can

438
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,682
improve, what is important.

439
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:45,364
First thing we did, we did the vignetting.

440
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:48,707
So I'll just go here and just show what vignetting does.

441
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:51,910
It's kind of framing the whole thing, and it's easier for you

442
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,112
to see what's important.

443
00:25:55,132 --> 00:25:56,974
You're looking at the characters and the character

444
00:25:56,994 --> 00:26:00,216
path. But when you look at the background, and the background,

445
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:01,077
this kind of noise.

446
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:06,241
Especially that the game that we're building, it's a 2D game.

447
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:08,123
You're going from left to right, up and down.

448
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:10,026
You can't really travel in depth.

449
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:12,829
There's too much of an information.

450
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,391
You don't need to go there.

451
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:17,956
It actually suggests you to go, but you can't give you a

452
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:18,857
different vibe.

453
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,258
Not the right vibe.

454
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:22,522
So what we did was blur everything.

455
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,103
We used a depth of field.

456
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:27,485
And that was one of the ideas, to make a really soft rendering

457
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:27,785
game.

458
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,207
But it also helps you to focus on the character,

459
00:26:31,287 --> 00:26:32,227
focus on the path.

460
00:26:32,947 --> 00:26:35,689
And everything else is there, but now I

461
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:36,709
don't need to go there.

462
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,530
I don't know what's there.

463
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,431
And the third one, very important in my opinion,

464
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,452
is to highlight the path.

465
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,274
I will go here and show you what the highlight.

466
00:26:46,294 --> 00:26:46,514
Yeah.

467
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:49,275
So highlight the path, critical.

468
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:54,027
Because it kind of tells you, like, you go right, especially

469
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,469
when it's a ledger, so I'll show you more examples later on.

470
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,031
But that's kind of finalized the look.

471
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:02,494
So when we got that, that's the formula.

472
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,376
That's the formula of Never Alone that I just

473
00:27:04,396 --> 00:27:05,336
showed you in five minutes.

474
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:08,079
It's easy to explain to the artist.

475
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,321
The only thing, we built the game.

476
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:16,468
I do like my normal day, I do like 5-10 paint overs every day, just paint on top.

477
00:27:16,488 --> 00:27:22,813
Like I grab the screens, if I see something like not following the direction or some too

478
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:28,177
much things going on in the background, distracting, I will just erase that, smooth it out, change

479
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:29,598
it and then just put it in the game.

480
00:27:30,987 --> 00:27:31,947
But that's the process.

481
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:34,550
I think it's a simple one.

482
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,693
So it's another palette that's a village palette, a little bit

483
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:42,856
warmer, real images over there, and the game is down there.

484
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:47,420
So again, we set up the range of colors.

485
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:49,622
And that's the image from the game.

486
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:51,043
Very important is composition.

487
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,965
We were lucky because we have control of the.

488
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,901
camera, we know where is the character going to be.

489
00:27:57,362 --> 00:28:00,744
We really said, OK, I wanted this bridge.

490
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:03,326
I wanted people to see it, because it's about to collapse,

491
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:04,666
or collapsed already.

492
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,147
You need to be there.

493
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:09,009
I want to compose the shots.

494
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:11,051
And because of the nature of the game, you can do that.

495
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:11,951
That's huge.

496
00:28:14,513 --> 00:28:16,594
Ice caves, another palette.

497
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,350
One of my favorite.

498
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:23,374
And you see, I explain to you the path that we highlighted.

499
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:28,537
If you look at the top of the ice flows, it's highlighted.

500
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,078
And how we highlight, we're not using,

501
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:33,080
actually it's also important, we use only one light,

502
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,981
directional light.

503
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:35,562
Everything else is painted.

504
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:37,763
Painted in vertices, so we paint vertices.

505
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:41,025
And that's the artist, they paint the vertices

506
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:43,407
to tell you I can come out on the left

507
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:44,948
or I can come out on the right.

508
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:49,838
I can't go in depth, I can't go anywhere, I can just do these two things.

509
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,143
Frame the shot, and now it's big, if something big is about to happen, we need to understand

510
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:59,484
what to do, how to solve the puzzle, frame it.

511
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:06,149
Coastal Village palette, also an interesting one, because the whole palette is desaturated,

512
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:13,113
it's very dark, the only thing is saturation comes from the northern lights.

513
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:14,910
Very bright and green.

514
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:20,116
So again, it could be really dark, but look at the planks.

515
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:21,957
We highlight the planks.

516
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:25,581
It's not realistic, but it's a nice contrast to have in the

517
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:25,861
image.

518
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:38,119
That's amazing creatures, that's amazing story, and this story I really want you to hear directly from the community.

519
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,383
That's one of the examples of our Culture Insights. We have 40 minutes of Culture Insights.

520
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:47,226
We actually recorded 40 hours of Culture Insights, and we boiled down to only 40 minutes.

521
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,729
But through the whole game, lots of you guys already played the game.

522
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,370
We kind of like...

523
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:57,514
unlock culture insights. To me it's like it's really really special

524
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,036
material so I wanted to share specifically this story.

525
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:12,759
When I was young my mom whenever the Northern Lights came out she just whistle

526
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:21,182
Boy they come alive just keep whistling in that Aurora Welsh

527
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:25,685
Just like, you know, you can almost hear it.

528
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:32,629
And then she explained to me a little bit later that those are children.

529
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:37,011
And children who've passed away when they're children.

530
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:41,253
You don't want to draw them in too much, you know, is what she said.

531
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,034
Because then they could play football with your head.

532
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:45,575
Play Eskimo football.

533
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:46,575
And that's what they want to do.

534
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,797
They're always playing with children up there.

535
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:52,774
Don't play out without your hood on.

536
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:58,840
If you don't have your hood on, the Aurora person is going to come down and chop your

537
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:00,402
head off and play ball with your head.

538
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:08,490
It wasn't like they were trying to do bad, you know, or it was like a scary story or

539
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,191
anything like that.

540
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:12,134
It was just that's how it was, that's what it was.

541
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:18,265
Great story, right?

542
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:25,890
I would like to talk now, let's go to the character development really quick.

543
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:28,692
How we develop characters.

544
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:33,115
First, inspiration that comes from Inupiaq art and from the real people.

545
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:38,879
On the right you see the little girl wearing Inupiaq parka, traditional clothing, made from the caribou.

546
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:47,538
on the left you see the art. It's traditional art. It's the sculpture and the graphics.

547
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:53,861
So the whole process, because we wanted to represent the culture, not to create some

548
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:58,843
kind of a unique looking beautiful girl. The girl or people that actually

549
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:02,898
reflects the culture.

550
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,801
If you're looking at the row in the middle,

551
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:10,144
they kind of fit. It feels like it's from the same world.

552
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,147
And that was the very important quality.

553
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:17,370
Even when we present our thinking behind our characters,

554
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,952
that's how we present to the community.

555
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:22,835
We're not just doing this kind of looking goal like we want.

556
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:24,156
We present it like that.

557
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:28,380
And for them, it's like, first of all, it's interesting to see our thinking process.

558
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,804
They're like, it's not like they even realize, but they're like, yes, that's what we like.

559
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,526
We really like the characters like that.

560
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:39,135
Because it's very subjective. I spent like 10 years working on the characters.

561
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:43,356
It depends what you do. Some people want this, other people want that.

562
00:32:43,516 --> 00:32:48,937
North Korea. I worked like Sokom and it was like the girl from South Korea.

563
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:52,318
And for them she's beautiful, but for Europeans not.

564
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:55,598
And it's like a lot of different things going into that.

565
00:32:55,678 --> 00:33:03,560
But I want to talk. So like it's the main characters, girl and the folks.

566
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,040
And...

567
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,993
important? Like, golf, she is like a brave girl, going on

568
00:33:12,013 --> 00:33:18,597
this journey, fearless, and fox as a companion has like other

569
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:23,600
qualities. Very cute and very fast, small, can get in a small

570
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,742
places, playful, but...

571
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:31,927
It wasn't that easy for us to figure out why, first of all, why we did the GIL.

572
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:37,374
Lots of people said that they... not like lots of people asking, and that was kind of a debate, even internally.

573
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:43,267
why we're not making a boy, why boy is not the main character.

574
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:46,689
And we felt like, because it's not a kind of violent game,

575
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,232
it's a game about you to understand the world,

576
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:53,295
tune to the world, to figure out what's around you.

577
00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:57,238
We felt like golf is the better character

578
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,319
because we don't have weapons, we don't fight,

579
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,482
we're not doing anything kind of fast and violent.

580
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,362
But the other reason, so like it fits better for this kind of a game, and the other reason we feel like

581
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:15,244
girl characters, female characters, are very underrepresented in the game. So if they're

582
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:20,485
presented, they're presented like in such a kind of stereotypical way that we really would like to change.

583
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:26,964
Third one, very personal, we all like Sean has two daughters, I have two daughters, but

584
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,626
I never play games with my daughters.

585
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:35,230
Because like all my experience before it was like shooting games, they have no interest

586
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,231
to play games like that.

587
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:41,895
And like we thought like if we'll make the game where the girl is the main protagonist,

588
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:43,076
it's a high chance.

589
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:45,778
And actually in fact that's the first game I played with my daughter.

590
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,999
We enjoy time together.

591
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:47,920
So it's like.

592
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:55,948
That's why. And the fox, it also wasn't that easy for us to

593
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:58,450
decide because at the very beginning we said yeah we do

594
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:03,655
want to have a fox but when we showed to the community members

595
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:08,480
that's a girl and that's a fox they liked it but some of them

596
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,921
approached us and said you know what?

597
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,323
Here in Alaska, we're really teaching kids not to play with fox because they have rabies.

598
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:23,327
And maybe you can change the character on something else, like a dog, or maybe a wolf,

599
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:24,968
or maybe an owl.

600
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:30,992
And I even did like this, like images, started kind of thinking how it's going to look, drew

601
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:32,713
like different variations.

602
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:34,034
But it wasn't just images.

603
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:39,837
We spent three months of the development redesigning the game, making the game with a bigger animal,

604
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:40,418
or the wolf.

605
00:35:42,663 --> 00:35:49,024
It's kind of like we had to change the design and we did it, but still we were not satisfied with the result.

606
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:56,686
It kind of feels like the goal becomes less important, the other character, the wolf, becomes stronger and more powerful.

607
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:59,707
And that wasn't the goal. We wanted the goal to be more important.

608
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:05,728
And we came back after presenting the new design, presenting everything, but we said we really feel the goal...

609
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:09,090
And the fox is a better combination.

610
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:15,172
It's better to build this warm feeling between them.

611
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,613
And that's what we ask them for permission.

612
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:20,574
And they say, OK, you did the job.

613
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,535
We see what you're talking about.

614
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:26,736
And they agree that we can leave the fox in the game.

615
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:31,080
So that's kind of my process of concepting the characters.

616
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,421
It's not like I did it before for other games,

617
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:36,164
but for this one it feels like really natural.

618
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,385
I drew all the images in black and white,

619
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:41,448
just kind of a fast sketch just to get the proportions and stuff.

620
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:45,111
But the thing is, because in that kind of style,

621
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:49,174
it instantly starts to look like it's indigenous kind of images.

622
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:50,355
Lots of people mistake it,

623
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:52,917
they're saying that some kind of indigenous artist did,

624
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,759
or like a native artist.

625
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:57,376
So that's why I'm kind of a little bit proud.

626
00:36:57,456 --> 00:36:59,817
I said, like, after two years and two and a half years

627
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:02,819
of development, I didn't learn the Inupiaq language.

628
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,879
I learned a couple words.

629
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,561
But I learned how to draw in Inupiaq.

630
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:08,201
So people don't even know.

631
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:13,925
And I wanted to show you, like, this character that's

632
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:16,746
a bad guy, guys who know, like, it's a manslayer.

633
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:23,310
And like I said, like, because people really warm there,

634
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,510
like, they're.

635
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:30,550
We wanted to, like, even the bad guys shouldn't be, like, really a monster or the kind of,

636
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:35,195
like, he's bad, he's chasing you, but, like, we don't want to make him, like, evil.

637
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:39,420
So I have a feeling if I will sit with these guys around the fire, I would be able to kind

638
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,023
of chat with him and he will warm it up.

639
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:45,608
So that's also kind of part of the design.

640
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:49,171
And besides just the normal characters,

641
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:51,013
we have supernatural characters.

642
00:37:51,494 --> 00:37:55,237
Characters that can shift from animals to people,

643
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:57,259
and from people to animals.

644
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:02,764
So I wanted you to hear from our writer, Ishmael Hope,

645
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:06,107
what the story, why that happens.

646
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,430
Also, I want to say, tomorrow Ishmael is going to be here.

647
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,511
He's a great guy.

648
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:12,633
He's a writer in our game.

649
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:16,676
And he's going to do the presentation at 4 o'clock,

650
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:19,358
I believe, with Sean, talking about the stories.

651
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:21,219
And let's.

652
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:30,067
We are taught that there's no hierarchy.

653
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:32,549
It's not everything else.

654
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,369
And then.

655
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:41,854
Man, you know, humans on top and they're separate from everything.

656
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:51,161
We're taught that everything is equal and that all the animals have a human form or

657
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,942
can be seen in a human form.

658
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:58,547
And so they have just as much or more intelligence.

659
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:03,631
You know, in fact, have a lot to teach people.

660
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:08,794
And so that's how these transformations can happen.

661
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:15,256
It's if the animal wants you to see it in its human form.

662
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:19,977
There's a story where a man comes up to an ice hole

663
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:25,138
and then realizes there's another man in his parka

664
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:27,979
that's got stuck in the net, you know,

665
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,559
and he's just stuck like that.

666
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,559
Oh, can you let me out?

667
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,420
Please help me.

668
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:38,667
You know, and so then he lets the man out, but then realizes that was actually a seal.

669
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:44,450
That was a seal man. And just because that seal wanted that help,

670
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,891
that seal allowed itself to be seen in human form.

671
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:55,995
It's great.

672
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,037
That's, uh, on the left, that's one of the characters like that.

673
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:02,338
Ookpeck, he transformed from...

674
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:07,927
a person, it's kind of, owls in Inupiaq is like wisdom.

675
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:14,071
But the process is the same, creating them also based on the Arctic Dolls and masks and

676
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:19,495
real people and it's like the image, kind of the sketch of him and that's how he looks

677
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:19,935
in the game.

678
00:40:22,194 --> 00:40:29,137
And that's the people that I said, little people, the people that the story that we heard from kids, and then we start to ask all the other people.

679
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:38,961
And they, they really like, seems like believable because like I asked the lady, she was like around 55 and tell me the story of how she'd been chased by the little people.

680
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:42,242
And I like started asking like more like, tell me like how, how big they are.

681
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:43,243
And she's like, like that.

682
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:43,874
I

683
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:44,054
think

684
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:10,776
the underground and they're coming out and they steal things. They're kind of a leprechauns in

685
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:18,501
a new world. They're very strong too. They can lift the caribou and can lift like big rocks like that.

686
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:24,045
And that's how that looks in the game. Them stealing drum.

687
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:29,489
So now I would like to talk about world of spirits.

688
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:32,710
And that probably was one of the most challenging things for

689
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,072
us to do, because worlds of spirits, at the very beginning,

690
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:41,074
we designed the game that way so you can be in real world,

691
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,634
and then you can go in a spirit world.

692
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:45,676
And our designers really wanted to have the button there that

693
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:48,777
you can press and go in one world, and then press one, and

694
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,837
then go to another one.

695
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:51,578
And they wanted to have this control.

696
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:54,760
controlling these two worlds.

697
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,262
And it was compelling design, and it worked.

698
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:02,967
But when we show it to the community and to Alaska guys,

699
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:04,989
and they were like, we like that.

700
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:05,909
What do you guys think?

701
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:08,391
And they're like, listen, and look at us.

702
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:11,854
And they're like, you know, it's not that easy.

703
00:42:11,974 --> 00:42:14,656
It's no button in the world that we can press and go

704
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:15,997
from world to world to another.

705
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:17,138
It's not on demand.

706
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:18,739
It's something.

707
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,640
It's a one world.

708
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:25,417
Where it's like spirits and real world, they believe, coexist in one place.

709
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:29,641
And to see them, you need to earn it.

710
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:34,586
You need to kind of be good, you need to be a good hunter, you need to respect the community.

711
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:39,230
You can't really press the button, it just gives them the wrong feelings.

712
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,533
And we're like, okay, that means we need to change.

713
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:47,411
And that's actually one of the examples of how we work with the community.

714
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:53,178
Because of that kind of conversations, their advice is we need to change the design.

715
00:42:53,218 --> 00:42:58,444
And that's not just to change one image, it's just change our thinking, how we think about the world.

716
00:42:58,504 --> 00:43:00,366
And that's a big deal.

717
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:05,190
And I want to add, like, that's one of the most inspirational.

718
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,995
I really like you to hear about Sila from the community,

719
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:15,238
because it's a very interesting and very spiritual video. ♪♪

720
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,902
Sila is the weather.

721
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:23,385
It also means the atmosphere.

722
00:43:24,506 --> 00:43:26,367
Here's the luna, or the land.

723
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:33,534
And it's anything from the land into the moon, the sun, the stars.

724
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:35,216
That's Xilla.

725
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,144
It's very spiritual, and we have a relationship with Xilla.

726
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:48,490
Xilla has a soul, in the same way we do as people, in the same way animals do.

727
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:56,722
I think spirit helpers in and of themselves are really about how we're connected with

728
00:43:56,782 --> 00:43:57,082
things.

729
00:43:57,162 --> 00:44:02,565
And so it may be that there is a spirit helper that shows themselves as a bird to show you

730
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:03,265
the way home.

731
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:09,269
Or it may be a spirit helper that actually decides to show themselves with the face and

732
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:11,310
body of a man instead of their animal form.

733
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,771
And so I think one of the things that's hard to understand is that it's not one way of

734
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:14,271
seeing things.

735
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:14,872
It's a human reaction.

736
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:17,233
And so I think that's one of the things that we need to understand.

737
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:18,194
And I think that's what we need to do.

738
00:44:18,214 --> 00:44:19,094
I think that's what we need to do.

739
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:21,975
It's one way of knowing you're connected to everything.

740
00:44:23,815 --> 00:44:29,497
We've always had that spirituality of everything around us.

741
00:44:31,097 --> 00:44:34,718
It's the interaction you have with the air you breathe,

742
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:38,599
the ocean that you gather resources from,

743
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,540
the rivers from which you gather fish,

744
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,340
the tundra from which you pick berries,

745
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,581
the animals that give themselves.

746
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:46,441
It's all of that.

747
00:44:50,864 --> 00:44:51,505
It's beautiful.

748
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:55,087
So how we develop the spirits visually,

749
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,828
it's also inspired by the art.

750
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:58,830
That's one of the examples.

751
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,391
And I will show you the image that I

752
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:04,414
drew for one of the sketches for our spirits in the game.

753
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:06,656
And that's how they look in the game.

754
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:09,578
It's very important, not just how visually, but also

755
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:12,520
how they move in the world, like very slow,

756
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,901
kind of dreamlike moving.

757
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:18,987
That's another example of Spirits, quick sketches I did.

758
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:22,170
But important to have, like, they're not just a platform.

759
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,671
There's something livable, something lives in this world.

760
00:45:26,132 --> 00:45:29,094
And that's how they look in the game already.

761
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:33,157
I'll go a little faster, but that's another example of them.

762
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:40,302
What you see right now here is...

763
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:50,828
Screamshaw. Screamshaw, like a lot of people really like how we did 2D animation to tell this story, but I wanted to tell you how that happened.

764
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:59,970
What Screamshaw is, it's a very beautiful form of art, traditional form of art for Nupics.

765
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,712
And it's one of the ways they tell the story and pass the story from generation to generation.

766
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,591
So they carve on baleen or ivory.

767
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:11,892
And when we saw this piece in Anchorage Museum,

768
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:13,952
it kind of caught our attention.

769
00:46:14,612 --> 00:46:16,733
By just looking at that, it feels

770
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:19,454
like it's some kind of a story there, something going on.

771
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:22,294
And we're like, why not to tell the story that way?

772
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:24,795
Why not to take that kind of a quality of the screenshot

773
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:25,935
and tell the story?

774
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:30,036
And I remember when we were flying on the plane,

775
00:46:30,336 --> 00:46:32,657
I did really quick drawings, like a storyboard,

776
00:46:32,717 --> 00:46:33,517
what we can do.

777
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:34,817
And then we develop.

778
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:42,269
This kind of style for that so you can animate and our talent and I made there and Fanny

779
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:45,314
Kind of breathe the life into them and we create

780
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:48,779
Their screenshots

781
00:46:51,585 --> 00:46:55,408
So what I wanted to tell you about the importance of the

782
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:56,369
inclusive development.

783
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:59,371
Like that's me wearing the snow goggles.

784
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:03,655
But this image is just, I like that, but it's kind of a

785
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:05,617
symbolic image for us.

786
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,979
Because that's what, when we put these glasses on, we're

787
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:12,602
trying to pretend that we are in NuPyX.

788
00:47:12,642 --> 00:47:15,605
Trying to understand what they see, how they see the world.

789
00:47:16,428 --> 00:47:18,909
That's the whole process.

790
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:20,609
The whole process is not us.

791
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:21,809
We have the idea.

792
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:22,410
Let's do that.

793
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,130
The process is what they see and how

794
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:27,231
to share what they see with the rest of the world.

795
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:30,332
So without this kind of work, we wouldn't

796
00:47:30,352 --> 00:47:31,932
be able to achieve what we achieved.

797
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:37,074
We wouldn't be able to achieve the look of the game.

798
00:47:39,455 --> 00:47:40,995
The most important, authentic look,

799
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,136
the look that represent the people who live there.

800
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:51,489
I wanted to say that we got blown away by the reception.

801
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,890
We nominated so many awards.

802
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:58,332
We like, buffed the next week.

803
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:00,393
Like today, we game.

804
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:07,015
We have a lot of games awards here and DICE awards.

805
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:12,556
But the most important thing, we also have many, many publications,

806
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,377
but the most important is the reception from the community.

807
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:18,097
And that's something that really touched us and moved us.

808
00:48:18,578 --> 00:48:21,718
Because when people see the game, they really feel that that's the game.

809
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:28,238
about them. That's the game that represents them. And that was the goal. I want you to

810
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:35,964
hear what this young gentleman, we met with him in Anchorage during the Youth and Elders

811
00:48:35,984 --> 00:48:40,667
Conference, and I want you to hear what he said.

812
00:48:46,912 --> 00:48:51,216
As soon as I heard the native words, I'm like, man, holy cow.

813
00:48:51,236 --> 00:48:52,477
A slice of culture.

814
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:53,477
This is cool.

815
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:56,760
And 25-year-old Vincent Gregory was instantly connected.

816
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,822
This is the way I want to teach right here, exactly this way right here.

817
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,183
It's really nice.

818
00:49:01,644 --> 00:49:06,587
It makes me feel happy to be a native.

819
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,529
Marty Glazer, Channel 2 News.

820
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:14,279
So what he just said, he said, it makes me be happy.

821
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,579
It makes me happy to be a native.

822
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,542
It's very powerful if somebody actually happy to be who he is

823
00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:24,983
and actually be proud of their culture.

824
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:28,244
And I think we couldn't ask more.

825
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:31,145
As a result, I think we achieved everything what we

826
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:31,885
wanted to achieve.

827
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:33,246
We made some people happy.

828
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:40,598
I think I'm satisfied with all this and we want to make more games and we want to make

829
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:42,059
more happy people.

830
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:49,824
I wanted to say Kiana and I wanted to say thank you everyone for being here and listening

831
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:50,044
to us.

832
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:53,327
Good job.
