1
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:09,077
So a couple weeks ago when they announced this,

2
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:10,358
I saw that I had the last slot of the day

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:13,159
and I got really nervous that no one would show up.

4
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,499
So thank you for replacing that

5
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:17,800
with nervous now performance anxiety.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,821
Full crowd, okay.

7
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,402
So for those of you who don't know me,

8
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:23,922
my name is Jim Brown, I'm a designer at Epic.

9
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:30,084
I was inspired to do this talk originally

10
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,905
when after almost 20 years in design,

11
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,586
I decided to move into a UX role.

12
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:44,803
I personally saw a huge amount of crossover between the UX process and the design process,

13
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:49,066
and I very quickly figured out that not everyone shared that same view.

14
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:53,529
It was a very genuine misunderstanding amongst,

15
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:56,871
especially on the design team, amongst the team,

16
00:00:56,871 --> 00:00:59,813
about how traditional UX principles,

17
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:03,955
especially 2D things from UI, interface design,

18
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,516
web design, things like that,

19
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:10,680
might apply or translate over into 3D game design.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,581
So my talk today hits on some of those topics

21
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,283
in the hope that we can bridge that gap

22
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:17,544
with a wider audience.

23
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:25,141
I actually see three major points where UX and game design share goals.

24
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:30,948
Both strive to clarify intent, to ensure that the designer's intent is understood by the

25
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:36,635
players, but also so that the player's intent is understood by the designers.

26
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:43,825
Both try to show empathy for the player, to empower them rather than frustrate them.

27
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:50,133
And both hope to provide meaning, to identify why someone would spend time with a game

28
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,037
and figure out what they can actually take away from that experience.

29
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,900
So I actually have 2 goals today.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,463
The first is to go over 3 areas of design

31
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:02,745
and show how those UX principles

32
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:07,409
can blend with some specific areas of design

33
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,251
to help create clarity, empathy, and meaning for the player.

34
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,415
And then the second is to give you some pro tips, so to speak,

35
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,637
to take back and kind of practice

36
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,979
when you try and implement these on your own

37
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,160
with your teams back home.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,704
So first up, first topic on there is encounter design,

39
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:29,787
more specifically how an encounter structure

40
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:33,210
can provide clarity for the player.

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,353
Encounter design, for those not necessarily familiar,

42
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:39,996
deals with any time the player encounters, yay,

43
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:42,898
a game component and has to interact with it.

44
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:46,141
This could be talking to NPCs, solving a puzzle.

45
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:49,064
Most often, this is a combat scenario.

46
00:02:50,424 --> 00:02:54,826
Most importantly, encounters are points of interaction

47
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:57,927
with the game, which is obviously where UX

48
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,268
can come into play.

49
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,889
So, quick pop quiz.

50
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,569
Many of you may have seen this already,

51
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,290
but when you look at this image,

52
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,191
do you see random stripes of color?

53
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,732
Thank you, Celia.

54
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,413
Or the cast of characters from a Street Fighter game?

55
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:18,455
And when you see this, did you see the letter B

56
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:18,955
or the number 13?

57
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:26,509
There are no wrong answers here because obviously we don't see the world as it is, we interpret

58
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:32,792
it and that interpretation is affected by both context and any existing knowledge that

59
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,592
we bring along.

60
00:03:35,177 --> 00:03:39,619
In order to understand what our players might do in an encounter,

61
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,620
in order to understand what their intent is,

62
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,481
we need to understand how their brains work.

63
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:47,782
How do they make choices? How do they get information?

64
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:51,043
How do they perceive the world around them?

65
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:54,485
And not surprisingly, those are all UX questions.

66
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:58,999
So luckily there are some guidelines like the Gestalt laws,

67
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,719
which hopefully I don't need to go into

68
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,860
with too much detail with this crowd,

69
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,681
but just to cover my bases again,

70
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:08,523
just in case, Gestalt is a very fancy way of saying

71
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:11,544
that we see objects in their entirety

72
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,325
before we break them up into their individual parts.

73
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:19,043
which is an example is the Gestalt Law of Similarity,

74
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:23,105
which describes why you probably see rows of dots here

75
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,146
that are organized by similar color,

76
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:28,168
rather than just seeing a random collection of dots.

77
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,650
And the Law of Proximity, which is probably explains

78
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,871
why you are more likely to see columns of dots here,

79
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,113
rather than just 36 individual circles.

80
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:42,199
Now I know that talking about Gestalt

81
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,380
with a group of UX people is very, very played out,

82
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,120
and I promise we're mostly done,

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,161
but I bring it up because these two principles

84
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:53,922
in particular have a direct application

85
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:54,943
to encounter design.

86
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,457
This is a screenshot from Serious Sam,

87
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:01,699
shared with me several years ago by a fellow designer,

88
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,061
and I kind of fell in love with this concept.

89
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,782
In this scene, or in this encounter,

90
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:10,345
the player is most likely to perceive two groups of enemies,

91
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,386
one on the left and one on the right,

92
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:15,088
because of their proximity to one another.

93
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:20,363
there is a chance that they may also see two groups based on their similarity,

94
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,565
the headless bombers and the brown NAR guys,

95
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:28,948
but it's very unlikely that they would see each enemy individually.

96
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:33,211
And as evidence of that, did anyone see the biggest threat in this scene,

97
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:38,413
or did you miss it entirely because it has no similarity and no proximity?

98
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:46,632
So these same Gestalt principles really helped guide the encounter design in Fortnite.

99
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:53,719
In the early game, you meet these small enemies called Husks, which are kind of just teach

100
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,580
you the general rules of combat.

101
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,264
And then as the game progresses, you run into these big purple enemies, which are called

102
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:05,189
the Mist Monsters, and they require very focused team coordination.

103
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,472
Now the order in which these enemies are introduced

104
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,113
helps the player learn.

105
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:12,355
There's nothing really special there, most games do that.

106
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:15,637
But the enemy's visual similarity

107
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,980
is also what helps make them understandable.

108
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,062
The humanoid looking husks are all individual threats.

109
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:25,467
and the purple mist monsters require team attention,

110
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:29,313
so that when you see a new enemy for the first time,

111
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,055
you automatically have an idea

112
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,659
of which category it falls into without,

113
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,182
or before you even know

114
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:37,065
what its individual capabilities might be.

115
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:41,338
And that recognition is especially important in Fortnite

116
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:44,499
because we spawn our enemies in these huge squads.

117
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:47,941
Sometimes there's even several dozen on screen

118
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,741
at a single time.

119
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:53,403
And so knowing that players are most likely to see

120
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:54,603
that entire squad as one unit,

121
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:58,345
having one giant purple thing that stands out

122
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:01,766
from all the rest helps the player overcome

123
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,147
that default state of perception

124
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:07,008
and to effectively prioritize targets.

125
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,829
So here's a screenshot from the game.

126
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,632
It zoomed in, so it's a little blurry, I'm sorry.

127
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,915
But if you look at the mini-map up on the top right,

128
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:18,639
each of those red dots is an incoming enemy.

129
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,262
And yes, there are a lot of them.

130
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:22,924
And this is me playing here.

131
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:26,367
If I had to parse through each of these enemies individually,

132
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:29,311
this would impose a huge cognitive burden.

133
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:33,938
and quite honestly I'd probably be dead by the time I got through half of them.

134
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:38,605
So while the enemies here are presented in large numbers,

135
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:41,529
this is the intended design.

136
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:46,304
the enemies are organized into specific ways

137
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:47,965
to account for human perception.

138
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:52,769
On the flip side, players are then given weapons,

139
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:55,751
traps, and special abilities that allow them

140
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:59,354
to sweep through entire groups of these enemies

141
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:05,518
all in one pass, as if a group really was a single enemy.

142
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,920
So in this screenshot, you can see how I've taken

143
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,162
that into account and purposely funneled them

144
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,123
between the rocks.

145
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,357
to create this single tight group,

146
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:18,608
and this signals my intent as a player.

147
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:23,175
Thanks to the visual organization of players,

148
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,337
of enemies in this encounter,

149
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:28,539
the designer intent and the player's intent

150
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,282
are now aligned, guiding the player on a path to success.

151
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:34,203
And with that success,

152
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:37,846
the player can learn repeatable behaviors

153
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:40,168
to find the same success or more success

154
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:41,509
in the next encounter,

155
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,712
which ideally becomes an ingrained pattern,

156
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,555
which you may also recognize as a flow state.

157
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:56,249
So these are UX principles being applied as design techniques.

158
00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:00,333
Gestalt, Cognitive Load Flow, usually only thought

159
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:04,217
of in terms of a 2D interface, are being used here

160
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:07,701
to help the player understand what their capabilities are,

161
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:10,423
what the game rules are, and embody

162
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:13,587
the intent of the design team through gameplay.

163
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,908
So this brings me to my first UX pro tip

164
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:23,711
on how to bridge the gap between UX and design.

165
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,755
This is a grown-ass man having a pants-wetting encounter

166
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:29,996
with a cuddle bear.

167
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,998
My first tip is actually a warning.

168
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:34,220
Don't be the bear.

169
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,863
If you come at a designer talking about gestalt

170
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:41,445
and cognitive load, they're gonna look at you

171
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:44,127
the same way that this guy is looking at the cuddle bear.

172
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:49,530
So go out of your way to learn design lingo.

173
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,411
Start the conversation in terms

174
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:53,574
that the designer can relate to

175
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,656
or that you both understand.

176
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:59,340
Talk about squad groups instead of gestalt laws.

177
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,182
Talk about combat pressure instead of cognitive load.

178
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:03,804
Save the technical jargon

179
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,807
for overbearing GDC speeches like this one.

180
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,094
All right, second category I want to talk about

181
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:16,578
is environment design, which has a lot to do

182
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:19,181
with showing empathy for the player.

183
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:23,179
we want our environments to be interesting and helpful

184
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,920
rather than just confusing.

185
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,041
And because game environments are so visual,

186
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,241
all of those UX factors that deal with human perception

187
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:36,542
also apply here with environment design.

188
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:40,083
So the same gestalt laws apply as well as a few others

189
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,143
like the law of closure,

190
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:44,344
which is why you see a circle and a square here.

191
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,005
Law of symmetry, which helps provide balance to a scene.

192
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:48,445
Continuity.

193
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,474
which gives alignment and common fate,

194
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:57,007
which kind of guides the eye down a straight path.

195
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:04,136
And just again, very briefly, I promise we're almost done with Gestalt entirely,

196
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,778
here is a screenshot from one of Epic's Paragon maps.

197
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,361
And there are some broken arches where we have the Law of Closure going on.

198
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:15,004
We have symmetry down the middle to balance the scene.

199
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:18,627
Players can follow the ramps up to the stairs, up to the arches

200
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,528
where the Law of Continuity is happening.

201
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:27,871
and the law of common fate as the architecture shapes really guide the eye down the center path

202
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,473
where all the important action is taking place. All of these concepts work together to make the

203
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:40,815
content easily digestible, showing empathy by lowering cognitive burden and helping players

204
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,636
maintain focus. Done with Gestalt.

205
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:51,222
So, negative space is another tool that helps players

206
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:54,124
by removing miscellaneous detail, grabbing their attention,

207
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:56,485
and giving them something to focus on.

208
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:01,217
We use negative space very intentionally

209
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,218
while designing game environments

210
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:06,221
by adjusting geometry, lighting, color,

211
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,463
contrast, various other effects.

212
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,565
This is a screenshot from Unreal Tournament.

213
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:14,149
There are various pieces of contrast

214
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,130
and negative space and things going on here.

215
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,673
The main point being the eye is drawn

216
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,454
straight down to the bottom of those towers

217
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:22,736
where all the important action takes place.

218
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,676
And if you contest that with the moment in Fortnite,

219
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:28,258
where you jump out of the battle bus

220
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,099
and you start skydiving,

221
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:32,203
and you see the world below you, and it's all chaos.

222
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,946
There's details and things going on,

223
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:38,810
and it's really hard to figure out what's going to happen,

224
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,593
until you start to drift down and start gliding.

225
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,455
And the negative space and contrasting colors here

226
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:48,715
help guide you toward an objective.

227
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:53,337
You can see very clearly the dark building tops

228
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:56,478
which stand out from all the other spaces to signal,

229
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:57,818
hey, maybe this is a place

230
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,159
where you should think about landing.

231
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,000
Good environmental design shows empathy

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,121
by guiding or helping the player along.

233
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:13,047
There are various other 2D techniques from painting

234
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:16,328
and photography and various others that can really,

235
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,090
really help with environmental design in gaming.

236
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,212
They may also really fall apart when things get translated

237
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:28,634
into 3D because players are independent beings.

238
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:31,616
We as designers have very little control over.

239
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:35,090
where they're going to be looking, what they're going to be doing,

240
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,334
or how they're going to be moving in any particular instance,

241
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,097
unless we take control away from them,

242
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:42,500
which is the absolute last thing we want to do.

243
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,301
So...

244
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:48,300
In a case like this, if you're trying to do, say, the rule of thirds, and you have your

245
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,685
geometry set up so that the horizon and the skyline are lined up perfectly, that's great

246
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:59,667
until the player is staring at a rock between their feet, in which case nothing works.

247
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:05,451
So while the actual practice of this type of thing doesn't always apply, the principle

248
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:06,611
behind it still does.

249
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:12,260
And so what I try to do is capture the essence and the meaning behind that

250
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:19,392
to incorporate it into a consistent visual language that can work across the entirety of the game.

251
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,883
A great example of this was described by the lead designer

252
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:27,344
at Naughty Dog in an article she wrote

253
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:31,367
about leveraging the affordances of primitive shapes.

254
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:36,431
She said that rounder shapes evoke safety and well-being,

255
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:40,714
rectangular shapes are solid, stationary, and powerful,

256
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,495
and those diagonal and pointy shapes

257
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,217
evoke a sense of danger or imbalance.

258
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:50,368
So when it came time for them to design their environments for Uncharted,

259
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:56,136
they were able to use these natural affordances as a means of communicating intent to the player.

260
00:14:56,136 --> 00:15:01,324
Where is it safe to go? Where is the eye most likely to focus?

261
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,265
And if I go back to that same Fortnite screenshot I showed you earlier,

262
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:12,409
you can see how some of those same affordances come into play

263
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,872
in guiding the player toward a landing spot.

264
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:19,737
The pointy clusters of trees are probably bad landing places.

265
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,799
The rounded treetops are...

266
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,294
Okay, they're probably benign, you can get some cover

267
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,076
if you can get underneath them,

268
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:30,418
but the strongest, safest places to land

269
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,620
are rectangular and solid.

270
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,182
This type of visual language helps the player

271
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,644
have a better experience by, again,

272
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:42,087
leveraging those natural tendencies of human perception.

273
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:48,457
Way back in the day, we used a very similar language with Gears of War,

274
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:55,899
so that when you saw a wall, or a car, or some sandbags, or this rock, or this roadblock,

275
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,440
they all had a consistent overall shape.

276
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,882
Again, bulky and solid to communicate safety, because these were all cover objects.

277
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,461
and very importantly, all of our cover was exactly the same height.

278
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:19,602
In Gears, if something looked like cover, it has to actually be cover. Because if someone's in cover

279
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:26,424
and they're still taking damage and getting shot, then we as designers have let them down. We can't

280
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:32,045
let the game lie to them, otherwise the core mechanic, this cover mechanic in Gears, completely

281
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:33,025
falls apart. Pardon me.

282
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:44,777
We tried really hard to be consistent with this language,

283
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:46,297
not just through Gears of War,

284
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,838
but through the entire Gears franchise,

285
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:52,200
where the end of every single wall

286
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,021
and every single game is the same minimum thickness.

287
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:59,283
So players see this nice, solid rectangle

288
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,904
and instantly recognize it as a cover object.

289
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:06,155
The space between objects is a standard minimum distance

290
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,577
to provide the necessary negative space

291
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,259
that allows players to know they can perform

292
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:13,160
their cover slide or their rolling moves,

293
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,062
all of these things which are really vital

294
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,203
to navigating through the environment.

295
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,566
And if you draw a plane across the entire battlefield,

296
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:23,829
you can see how, again, cover everywhere

297
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,690
is all exactly the same height,

298
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,872
whether it's in this courtyard

299
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:30,354
or the rocks along the shoreline.

300
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:33,496
or junk in an abandoned farm,

301
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:37,179
or the supplies and counters in this abandoned market,

302
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:40,603
there's a standard visual language

303
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,545
that we never, ever varied from.

304
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:46,108
Everything is purposefully consistent

305
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,872
so that anyone, no matter what their skill level is,

306
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:53,155
instantly knows what objects are cover,

307
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,598
which aren't, what's dangerous, and what's safe.

308
00:17:56,667 --> 00:18:02,468
Again, there are a million other visual tricks that artists and designers love to use in these spaces.

309
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:08,935
But the point that I'm trying to get across is that if you understand how someone sees,

310
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:14,397
which is UX, you can do a better job of presenting what they see, which is design.

311
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:19,379
And applying UX principles to your environmental design specifically

312
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:23,961
shows empathy for the player by reducing their overall cognitive burden

313
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:27,422
and guiding them toward that better game experience.

314
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,744
So my UX pro tip for environmental design

315
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,586
is to always respect the environment.

316
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:39,048
Now I don't mean this in the sense

317
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:42,031
that you should be recycling, even though you should.

318
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:47,076
I mean that the game environment is more than just a space

319
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:48,517
in which the game takes place.

320
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:53,865
The environment is actually core to the game experience.

321
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:57,270
It affects how people see the game, how they interact with it,

322
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,234
and how they feel about it.

323
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,438
It's more than just a place.

324
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:08,838
All right, last section is system design.

325
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:12,741
Systems tend to be a lot more abstract.

326
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:16,124
They're difficult to visualize in 3D space,

327
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,326
but they are arguably the most important

328
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,688
or most significant piece of this puzzle

329
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,870
because they do such a great job

330
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,752
of giving the player both context and meaning.

331
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,024
Designers can sometimes get caught up

332
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:34,484
in the 2D nature of systems.

333
00:19:34,484 --> 00:19:38,145
We love to get lost in our spreadsheets and data tables,

334
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:42,867
but what I propose is that we should think of them

335
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,467
not in 2D, not even necessarily in 3D,

336
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:49,809
but in 4D, meaning how does a system

337
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,670
affect a player over time?

338
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,871
Here is a legendary pistol from Fortnite.

339
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:00,234
In 2D, all the stats are there.

340
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:02,536
It's super exciting if you love numbers,

341
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,937
and the drop rate is like 0.001%.

342
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:09,302
In 3D, it looks like the Funky Space Pistol, which is cool,

343
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:11,864
but think about it in 4D.

344
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,007
Imagine how the player is going to feel

345
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,230
when they actually get this pistol in the game.

346
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,613
Imagine all the experiences that they're going to have

347
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,475
to reach the point where they have it leveled up

348
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:24,316
to max power.

349
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:29,826
and think about everything that they've had to learn and master along the way.

350
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:35,905
Systems in Fortnite are designed specifically

351
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:38,325
to help the player find meaning.

352
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:41,866
This is a not so exciting screenshot

353
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,207
from a quest system that we're working on,

354
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:47,528
but you can see how the quest circles break down

355
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:50,709
these kind of complicated, long quest chains

356
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:53,250
into digestible pieces and patterns.

357
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,971
The completion marks help provide feedback to the player.

358
00:20:58,012 --> 00:21:03,658
Showing what quests rewards are coming up helps players set goals and this

359
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:08,904
tracking provides a way for players to measure their progress in the overall

360
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:15,411
game. The goal of this type of system is to give player visibility into kind of

361
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:19,015
the underpinnings of the game which shows that design intent.

362
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:24,044
to offer them achievable short-term goals

363
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:29,367
with extrinsic rewards, which shows empathy and respect

364
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:32,749
for their time, and hopefully encourages

365
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,451
the formation of longer-term achievement

366
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:40,754
and intrinsic reward, which is where that meaning comes from.

367
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:43,076
This is all three of those UX pillars

368
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,337
I've been talking about today rolled

369
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,518
into one boring system screen.

370
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:53,365
But systems don't necessarily need to be quite so player-facing

371
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:56,792
in order for them to provide that same level of meaning.

372
00:21:57,742 --> 00:22:01,345
As an example of that, this is another screenshot from Gears,

373
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:04,227
and Gears has no health bar.

374
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,348
Instead, as you start to take damage,

375
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:09,710
we draw this cog in the center of the screen,

376
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,932
and if you get to safety,

377
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:13,693
the cog will fade back down over time.

378
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:14,674
If you don't, it goes opaque,

379
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:17,035
and then you die, pretty straightforward,

380
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,997
but there's a ton of fancy UX stuff

381
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:20,918
that's going on under the hood

382
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:23,200
that players probably don't even realize.

383
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:28,269
The central location of that cog and its bright color

384
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:30,609
make it really hard to miss.

385
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:33,290
And the arrows along the edge show the direction

386
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,130
that the threat is coming from.

387
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,731
When we do start to fade it in,

388
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,272
we purposely fade in the edges of the cog first,

389
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:43,772
and then go in toward the center,

390
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:47,953
which reinforces both the shape and location of the reticle.

391
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:52,673
and for reasons I don't have time to explain, that reticle isn't always there in gears,

392
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:56,580
so sometimes this is your only indication of where to shoot.

393
00:22:57,544 --> 00:23:01,207
And in fact, when you're just about to die,

394
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,409
we try and give you one last ping,

395
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:04,771
this audio ping that comes on,

396
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,653
that lets you know that you're in a critical state.

397
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:11,417
And at that point, the cog is also fully filled in,

398
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:14,560
it's fully opaque, and it's kind of a not-so-subtle reminder

399
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,382
that like, hey, I'm not letting you see this thing

400
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:18,984
because you shouldn't be engaging with it,

401
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,365
you should be retreating into cover.

402
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,382
The full array of all these warnings working together

403
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:29,926
is specifically intended to help players of all skill levels.

404
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:32,588
You know, a very experienced player can push this to the limits,

405
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:34,469
an inexperienced player may just be like,

406
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,871
oh hey, okay, I finally get it, I'm retreating.

407
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:41,795
And the other thing is, is that that last bit of health,

408
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,537
that critical portion where you're just about to die,

409
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:48,482
is actually more resistant to damage

410
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,123
than any of your other health.

411
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:52,784
So very often, you'll come away with this feeling

412
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:56,045
that you just barely survived an encounter,

413
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,306
and it's because we lied to you.

414
00:23:57,306 --> 00:23:59,547
We told you you were about to die when you really weren't.

415
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:02,608
But rather than feeling like they screwed up

416
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:06,549
and almost died, players now have this exciting story

417
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,490
where they can talk about pulling something off

418
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,091
at the last second, which in turn,

419
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:13,892
can make that experience

420
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:15,173
more memorable.

421
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:18,015
Another example from Gears is our active reload mechanic.

422
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:25,481
When you reload a weapon in Gears, it goes through all of the reload stuff as you'd expect,

423
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:28,623
but it also starts a little mini-game on the HUD.

424
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:32,966
A marker scrubs from left to right, and you have the opportunity to hit reload a second time.

425
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:36,569
If you hit it the second time while it's in that sweet spot,

426
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:37,930
you get a weapon boost.

427
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,354
It's more damage, higher rate of fire, whatever. It's different per weapon, but it's always a benefit to you.

428
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,622
If you hit reload the second time while it's outside of that sweet spot,

429
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:53,325
you jam the weapon, and it takes longer to reload, and you get no bonus.

430
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:58,587
Now, this active reload system dramatically impacted player behavior

431
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:01,969
in ways that we didn't really expect when we first implemented it,

432
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:06,171
which led to an overhaul of our entire system's design.

433
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:09,344
because advanced players figured out

434
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:12,306
that if they did the active reload early,

435
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:15,288
they would get more damage in the rest of their clip.

436
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:20,032
And that meant that they were doing more damage

437
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:21,593
to all of the enemies in the game.

438
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:23,535
And because they were more successful,

439
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:25,696
they were doing this more often.

440
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:27,438
So we actually had to go back

441
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:30,040
and redesign all of our enemies

442
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,723
to account for this higher level of damage output.

443
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,924
But most of our new players,

444
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:38,517
didn't use the active reload system.

445
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,599
They were too afraid of jamming

446
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:43,402
or didn't know that the system even existed,

447
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:45,804
so they were more likely to just empty out their clip

448
00:25:45,804 --> 00:25:48,267
to the very end, then wait for the reload,

449
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,828
and then re-engage,

450
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,830
which meant they weren't getting the active bonus,

451
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,192
so they were being doubly punished

452
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:57,796
by not doing extra damage and facing more powerful enemies.

453
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:02,054
So to account for this, what we decided to do

454
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:05,776
was actually boost the damage of the last few bullets

455
00:26:05,776 --> 00:26:06,116
in every clip.

456
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:09,057
We called them magic bullets.

457
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:12,117
Now advanced players usually missed the magic bullets

458
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:15,559
because they did that mechanic where they reloaded early

459
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,359
to get the active boost.

460
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:20,629
while newer players were more likely to hit them

461
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:23,029
because their behavior that we saw

462
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:25,370
was that they were draining the clip to the very end

463
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,491
and hitting those bullets before going into a full reload.

464
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:32,192
So better UX on this system

465
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:35,713
ensured that everyone found more meaning in with it,

466
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:39,674
regardless of their skill level or overall play style.

467
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:43,115
Systems exist to help the player.

468
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:46,797
They teach, they guide, and they reward.

469
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,571
they should lay out the entirety of a game like a roadmap

470
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:53,492
that shows the players their potential

471
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:55,812
and hopefully present it in a way

472
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:58,273
that promotes growth over time.

473
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:02,475
All right, my pro tip for system design

474
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,815
is kind of a no-brainer,

475
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:05,956
but it is worth reinforcing for sure.

476
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:11,237
This is a llama unicorn riding a rainbow.

477
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,358
I wanted to include this image

478
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:16,099
because it's a frigging llama unicorn riding a rainbow.

479
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:21,546
Also, if you know Fortnite,

480
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:24,708
then this might have some more meaning packed into it.

481
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,909
You might get the inside joke there.

482
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,972
If you don't know Fortnite, then it's just quirky

483
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:34,014
and probably strangely out of place.

484
00:27:34,014 --> 00:27:37,357
And that is actually my point.

485
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:39,498
Game systems are like unicorns.

486
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:42,300
They're very exciting to the rare person

487
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,922
who gets to meet and understand them.

488
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:48,004
but very opaque to the vast player population.

489
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,807
So whether it's controls, monetization, progression,

490
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,108
abilities, whatever the system is,

491
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:58,611
remember that systems are about the player, not the data.

492
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:03,694
They should serve the player directly and clearly.

493
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:07,157
Systems require user-centered design

494
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:12,360
just like everything else, and this is your specialty.

495
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,762
So try and make it your responsibility.

496
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:19,454
As we look back on those original pillars

497
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:22,335
that I talked about at the beginning of the talk,

498
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,857
I hope I've been able to show you how each can play

499
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:28,499
into the various aspects of game design.

500
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,261
It is worth mentioning that these

501
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,302
are not mutually exclusive sets.

502
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:36,884
Good environmental design doesn't just show empathy,

503
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:40,967
it can also clarify intent, it can also provide meaning.

504
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:44,051
And these are not the only aspects of UX

505
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:46,153
that crossover into design.

506
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:48,056
They're just the three explicit ones

507
00:28:48,056 --> 00:28:51,060
that I had time to talk about today,

508
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,762
which means I am out of time.

509
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:55,665
But if you do have questions, I will stick around to the end.

510
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,890
I would love to hear your thoughts.

511
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,311
Thank you very much for your time.
