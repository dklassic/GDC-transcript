1
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:15,815
Hi, my name is Brett Norton and welcome to Force Multipliers,

2
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,235
long term design careers for non-leads.

3
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:21,136
I'm the director of design development and cryptic studios

4
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:24,116
in sunny San Jose, California in the United States.

5
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:27,437
I've been working design for just under 20 years or so

6
00:00:27,437 --> 00:00:28,937
and I've met a lot of people

7
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,277
and I've seen a lot of careers develop

8
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,378
and it's led me to want to do this session

9
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:33,898
focusing on careers for designers,

10
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:35,598
especially those that don't want to be

11
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:36,799
your traditional leader.

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,459
So let's get into that and let's talk about

13
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:39,379
what we're all gonna do.

14
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:43,904
So, quick up. First, this is gonna be broken down into three acts. The first act is gonna be on

15
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:47,631
designer criteria. And this is where we're gonna quantify some of the basic design skills. It will

16
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:52,119
help us understand sort of the difference between someone who's a sort of senior-esque designer and

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,020
a non-senior designer.

18
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,720
Step two is going to be the gap.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,542
And this is where we get into sort of seniors versus non-seniors

20
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,602
and leads versus non-leads.

21
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:03,044
This will help us separate about what force multipliers kind of are

22
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:06,986
and sort of where leads start to become sort of the traditional career trajectory

23
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:07,746
for a lot of designers.

24
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:10,748
But what we can do elsewise and how we can separate the valuable skills

25
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,389
that seniors provide us, even when they're not leads.

26
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:16,951
And then act three is going to be focusing on growing force multipliers.

27
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,153
That's going to kind of focus on ways to grow and develop people

28
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,154
into being force multipliers who aren't leads.

29
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:26,505
Jumping straight into it, target audience for this session is, of course, anybody who's a leader,

30
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:31,027
manager, stakeholder, anybody who really supervises a designer is sort of a key portion of this

31
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:35,330
audience. And these will give you some strategies for how to work with the seniors in your team.

32
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,592
But we also want this to be targeted towards designers, which is, you know, people who are

33
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:43,135
trying to figure out how to grow their careers. Maybe they don't want to be a traditional design

34
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:46,957
lead, but they still want to have a positive impact on their company and their projects and

35
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:49,999
really kind of be that force multiplier. This will give you some ideas on how to talk with

36
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,560
your supervisors about what you can do.

37
00:01:52,364 --> 00:02:01,454
Jumping straight into Act 1 now, let's go into that designer criteria and talk about some of the skill sets and how we kind of separate some of the basic skills of designers from some of the more advanced skills we'll talk about later.

38
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:09,503
So, three kind of key sets that we kind of classify designer criteria, and we've got your sort of professional skills, project and development skills, and general design skills.

39
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:12,306
But, don't worry about this, we'll go into a little bit more on each of these here in a second.

40
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:16,588
Starting out with professional skills, these are sort of just skills that are used at any job.

41
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:21,150
They're not really specific to design or even necessarily the gaming industry as a whole,

42
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,273
but they're still important job skills for things like communication and attendance,

43
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:28,214
fairness, and generally these are kind of graded on a binary pass fail,

44
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,636
and these generally make you a more pleasant person to work with.

45
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:34,518
It's important to note we don't necessarily consider these a lot in sort of gaming industry

46
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:37,759
careers, but for people who have never had a career outside of the gaming industry,

47
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,720
they may not have all these skills and developing them as they start out their

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,202
jobs at the early ranks of being a designer is still important and you still kind of want

49
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,182
to grade that in some cases.

50
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:47,937
Next up, we've got project and development skills,

51
00:02:47,937 --> 00:02:50,899
which are things that are more specific to like a project, technology or company.

52
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:54,061
There might be things like IP knowledge, like what do you know about D&D

53
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:55,922
if you're working on a Dungeons and Dragons games or maybe Star Trek

54
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,163
if you're working on a Star Trek game?

55
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:58,363
Genre knowledge.

56
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:00,224
What do you know about shooters if you're working on a shooter?

57
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,906
You know, how much do you know about RPGs if you're working on one of those?

58
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,868
Things like development environment, though, too.

59
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,429
Like, do you know how your asset manager works?

60
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,890
You know how to get things in and out of builds and troubleshooting.

61
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,452
Do you know what to who to talk to or what to do when a problem occurs?

62
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:17,640
These are the type of skills that make you more efficient and effective and generally

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,666
quick to work with in your team's sort of specific development environment.

64
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,914
And sometimes they're very specific to an actual project or, you know, maybe just a

65
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,756
specific line of tech.

66
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:30,486
Then we have design skills, and these are sort of specific to your design subdiscipline. These are

67
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:34,747
like systems designer skills, level designer skills, content designer skills, writer skills,

68
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,268
etc. These might be those specific to a bit of a genre and engine because sometimes there's some

69
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:42,809
very specific skills, like shooters have some specific skills to their genre that don't

70
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:46,910
necessarily map over to say puzzle games, and that's just the way things go. These are the

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,691
skills that allow you to really build features and content and get them into the game in a fun,

72
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:52,191
interesting way.

73
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:55,433
So let's quantify a few of these designer skills because you have some general skills,

74
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:58,316
and I'm not going to try to list all of them. I could do a whole presentation just on design

75
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:01,879
skills. But you do have general ones with things like math, and yes, systems designers are going

76
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,842
to have a lot more math skills generally. But we also have things like general ones like usability

77
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:09,285
and player communication. These are important facets for designers to understand and grow into,

78
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:11,066
and they're good things for all designers to have.

79
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,067
So then moving beyond that,

80
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,868
we have specific implementation skills,

81
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,969
which are going to be things like items,

82
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,910
or perhaps say item assignments.

83
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,371
And with items, it might be something like,

84
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:21,612
okay, we're going to implement a bunch of swords

85
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,933
into our games, and that'll be a reward that we use.

86
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,394
But item assignments are something that we use

87
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,194
for say a professions or a crafting system.

88
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,295
That's how we kind of group things,

89
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:29,336
like how you make a sword,

90
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,477
what are the different sword recipes, et cetera.

91
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,718
Both those are done through different tools

92
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,158
in our tool set in Engine.

93
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:36,999
And so we actually quantify those

94
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,320
as completely different skills

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,061
and associate grading with each of those.

96
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:43,406
And there's also some things we have which we call like FSM scripting, which is more like AI

97
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:46,750
scripting. You may have different tools or names for it, but it's basically how well do you script

98
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,353
AI and what do you do with those sorts of things.

99
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:52,417
So skill progression, let's talk a little bit how we quantify some of those skills.

100
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:56,538
So some skills are just binary or very simply graded, which is like pass fail.

101
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:59,699
And again, things like attendance, you know, it's either good enough or it's not.

102
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,360
And you're generally not going to try to like give them a score or anything.

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,221
But another way of doing something that's not just sort of like a one through 10 or

104
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:10,182
one through five scores, you can do what we call literacy, competency and mastery.

105
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:12,422
And that breaks down as kind of these three categories,

106
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:13,822
which are kind of listed right there.

107
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,363
But what it really comes down to is that

108
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,383
if someone progresses, you know,

109
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,143
they go from sort of being able to just copy

110
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,464
and paste things within it,

111
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,364
to being competent and understanding it,

112
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,445
to really having a true mastery of it

113
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:25,345
and being able to actually improve on it

114
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,305
and do new things with it.

115
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:27,425
And all those are important.

116
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:29,206
And if someone grows, that might be their target.

117
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:31,566
It's like, hey, develop literacy in items.

118
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,087
And then later on, literacy in item assignments

119
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:35,127
and then competency in items.

120
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:36,888
competency in item seven, mastery, et cetera.

121
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:39,149
And it creates sort of a progression path,

122
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,990
a targeted easy way for designers

123
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,350
as they work their way up to sort of junior

124
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,091
and staff levels to grow

125
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:46,172
in these individual contribution skills.

126
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,932
A quick apt one recap,

127
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,433
we've talked about professional skills,

128
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,253
which is for any job,

129
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:51,094
project and development skills,

130
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:53,194
which are sometimes project tech or tools

131
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:53,955
or dev team specific,

132
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,035
and these design skills,

133
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,636
which sometimes translate, you know,

134
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,816
between teams and projects.

135
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,917
Sometimes they're specific,

136
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,578
but overall, these are the crux

137
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,118
of really key design skills we've got.

138
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:06,161
Now let's talk about Act 2, and this is the gap.

139
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,163
And this is where we get into some interesting difference

140
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:11,787
between what a force multiplier is and what is and what isn't.

141
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,710
So first up, it's non-seniors versus seniors.

142
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,993
So with staff rankings, this will help break down kind of like

143
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:20,116
when people are often called seniors within the industry.

144
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,478
But I'll separately talk about when I think that they really are.

145
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,561
So juniors, these are people usually that have been around for say zero to three years.

146
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,182
They're mostly focusing on how quickly they can learn.

147
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:32,464
They have a lot of literacy, a little competency, probably no mastery.

148
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:35,205
And maybe there's a little bit more again, if you have a great educational background,

149
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,826
you went to a great design school, you came in,

150
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:40,388
you might have higher competency and mastery than someone else who's a junior.

151
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:42,029
And so you'll see some variance within that one.

152
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,389
Then after a couple of years, you generally get to like a staff, maybe it's a little bit sooner,

153
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,413
maybe it's a little bit later. And this is where you have a high degree of competency and you're

154
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:52,737
contributing to content and features. You're building a lot of shippable, reliable stuff,

155
00:06:52,737 --> 00:06:56,281
and you can really do a lot of the bulk work for a game now at that point. Again,

156
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:59,484
maybe you've got a few things that you're a master at now. You can really do some

157
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:02,448
things pretty well, especially if you've been sort of like practicing and learning ahead.

158
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:05,838
But then we get into seniors and seniors have an ambiguous start range.

159
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:09,200
Maybe it's five years, maybe it's six years, but it's not just based on experience,

160
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,581
because when you get to be a senior, you know, we start to care about how well

161
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,181
you can own content and features.

162
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,142
It's it's more about being a driving force.

163
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:18,123
That's kind of like what a lot of being a force multiplier is.

164
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:19,263
It's really being able to drive a force.

165
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,624
It's not just being really good at making items.

166
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,385
It's like, you know, can you help define new item systems

167
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,226
or new reward avenues, those sorts of things?

168
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,967
And seniors generally have a high degree of competency

169
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,748
and a lot of mastery and a lot of related areas,

170
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:34,009
which allows them to really be those effective feature

171
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:34,949
or content owners.

172
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,430
Now, there are rankings beyond seniors,

173
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,230
such as there are things like principals,

174
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,332
which may be sometimes a kick in at 10 plus years.

175
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:42,792
And that's now starting to determine

176
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:44,393
how well you can drive like whole projects or.

177
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:47,014
perhaps large teams or even abstract goals.

178
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,694
And this requires obviously a lot of experience and a lot of exposure.

179
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:52,335
And you're expected to be highly masterful in a lot of areas,

180
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,776
as well as maybe still having company in some areas, et cetera.

181
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:57,577
But when you get to the principal level, you have a ton of experience.

182
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,518
You've probably shipped more than a couple of games.

183
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:02,358
You've you know, you've been through the rigmarole a few times

184
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,099
and you have a lot of lessons learned on how to do things well

185
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,160
and what pitfalls to avoid.

186
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:11,825
But there's an extra secret ranking based on careful discussions and interviews and

187
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,327
investigations into some of the people that I talked with before this presentation.

188
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:19,530
There's also additional groups which you call either experts, sometimes they're called architects,

189
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,653
and sometimes they're called senior experts. But these are sort of like principles but with

190
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,555
incredible experience and expertise.

191
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,978
And they have invented things like genres or entire IPs

192
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:30,219
or new modes of gameplay.

193
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,780
They've done something fairly standout,

194
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,562
something that probably required a lot of risk

195
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:35,043
and a lot of expertise.

196
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:37,185
And they pulled it off and were very successful then.

197
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,986
That doesn't mean necessarily monetarily successful.

198
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,308
Sometimes it just means they were very innovative

199
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:41,849
and did something very interesting.

200
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,490
They've proven themselves to set themselves apart.

201
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,213
These are sort of like the doctorates, if you will,

202
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:49,055
of the design world where they've kind of had a thesis

203
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,737
that's been vetted either by the community

204
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:51,317
or other designers.

205
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:55,058
We don't have a formal process for this within the gaming industry or generally companies

206
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:57,039
as a whole, but experts are pretty rare.

207
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,941
In talking with some designers, they were companies that had 150 plus employees and

208
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:06,082
they may only have two or three experts, sorry, 150 plus designers and only two or three of

209
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:06,843
those may be experts.

210
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:09,323
So it's a very coveted role and it doesn't happen a lot.

211
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:12,685
As you can see, because it requires 15, maybe 20 years experience, there aren't even a lot

212
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,506
of designers that actually have that level of experience, much less those could quantify

213
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:19,747
as experts as having done something so outstanding as to sort of be their doctoral thesis.

214
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:24,310
Moving on, let's talk about the inflection point. This is when a designer suddenly has

215
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,613
competency in pretty much all their key areas. A system designer with a lot of competency,

216
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:30,655
they've got mastery in some, they're getting good, you know, and they're getting efficient,

217
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:34,759
and they can improve things, and they start to start to understand. But these skills alone

218
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,463
aren't enough to be a force multiplier, because you're probably still like very heavily buried

219
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:42,206
in a lot of sort of icy skills, again, like items and items, assignments, or maybe scripting,

220
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:42,666
that sort of thing.

221
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:46,090
What you really need to get good at is the skills, let it be an owner, because that's

222
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,453
what's going to let you really be a force multiplier. So Senior Plus is going to require

223
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:55,338
a new type of skills. You get to start over with skills like ownership, which is related to process,

224
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:59,862
mentorship, which is related to management, vision, which is related to architecture,

225
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:02,744
technical design, which is a lot related to infrastructure. I'll get more to that. It's

226
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:06,808
kind of a loaded term because it sometimes uses a job too. And then multiclassing,

227
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:08,650
which is a form of versatility, which is important.

228
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,110
And don't worry, these things are going to come up a lot.

229
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,451
Don't feel like you have to write them down now.

230
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,251
I'm going to go through them multiple times.

231
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:18,532
So let's talk about each of these individual skills and why they are these new skills that you don't develop early on,

232
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:22,473
but suddenly start becoming more important and meaningful and define senior pluses.

233
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:26,755
So ownership is sort of a mastery of process and pipelines at many various stages,

234
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:27,335
and not just like.

235
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:32,680
the design stages, the art stages, the QA stages, the audio stages. They really understand how

236
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,904
things like a map goes through so many different stages, through concept and whiteboxing, all that,

237
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:40,087
and they understand what things can be done better. You know, maybe they're a level designer

238
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:43,731
and they're a principal level designer, but they understand, aha, good concepts will let me do my

239
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:46,894
job better. So three months before I start a whitebox, I need to make sure that we've got

240
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:47,935
good concepts and they get that.

241
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,607
They have very quality inter-department communication.

242
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,848
Say they're a system designer,

243
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:53,168
they're good with talking with

244
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:55,009
content designers and level designers and writers.

245
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,250
It's not the people that they work most closely with,

246
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,231
but if they need to get something implemented into a map,

247
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,292
they know they can go to the level or content designers and

248
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:03,173
work with them to get a quality implementation

249
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:03,973
of the map on their feature.

250
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,395
And they also have quality interdepartment.

251
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:08,357
They can talk with artists and programmers.

252
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:10,439
They know the people they commonly work with

253
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,781
and who they need to support to make the feature or content good.

254
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,882
That's that ownership thing.

255
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:17,685
It's about caring more than just about the design component of it.

256
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,867
It's also interesting that you need good art and good programming.

257
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:22,610
Everyone has to succeed for a feature to be good

258
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,771
or a piece of content to be good.

259
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:30,797
So on the mentorship side, this is where your senior, your seniors make experts out of non-experts.

260
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:35,421
This is the teaching mastery to others. And so I look at it like, you know, a senior designer or

261
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:39,765
a principal and expert designer is not a samurai wandering alone in the wasteland slaying monsters

262
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,265
by himself.

263
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:45,668
He's a guy that goes to a dojo and helps train other students to become masters themselves.

264
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:47,308
He doesn't have to be the master of the dojo.

265
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:50,230
I mean, he doesn't want that task of, you know, running a bunch of senseis and a whole

266
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,371
ton of students, but he can at least train other people and make them more skilled as

267
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:53,451
well.

268
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,332
He can create disciples.

269
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:57,894
And not only can he do this with designers,

270
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,836
but he can do it with non-designers too.

271
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:00,937
He can train artists a little bit,

272
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,418
he can train programmers a little bit,

273
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:03,379
he can make them care about the things

274
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:04,581
that they should care about

275
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,823
to make for a better total end quality thing.

276
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:08,064
You know, designers sit in a spot

277
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:10,006
where they see a lot of the connection points

278
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,507
and that's the real strength that they can offer,

279
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,989
even if they're not a people lead,

280
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,910
is that sort of connectivity that they offer

281
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,572
between the teams and disciplines

282
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:17,813
and understanding the vision of things.

283
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,795
Speaking of vision, that's the next skill we'll talk about.

284
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:24,338
So I'll talk about non-senior designers first. They're often reactive designers in the sense

285
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:27,781
that they will respond to direction and they can fix all kinds of problems. They can implement

286
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:32,044
things and you know if bugs come along they'll be able to address them. They can make reasonable

287
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:35,366
deductions about how to address problems and you know they'll get things and they'll solve

288
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:39,049
problems for you. And so you can think of them as like curators. You throw them at bugs that you

289
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,972
have to make them go away, cure them, improve things and move on. Once the issue is kind of

290
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:43,832
known they can deal with it.

291
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,675
But your senior designers, no, they're proactive designers.

292
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,435
They're the ones that are going to set directions,

293
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,376
they're going to set standards,

294
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:52,977
they're going to prevent bugs from ever happening.

295
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:54,757
They're going to save you work in the long run.

296
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:56,718
And they're going to be able to solve risky

297
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,899
or more complex or more volatile problems

298
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,040
because of their experience

299
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,500
and because of their ability to set direction

300
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,300
and things early on.

301
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,601
They've seen these things.

302
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,562
And I think of them as vaccines.

303
00:13:05,562 --> 00:13:07,202
They prevent issues from ever happening.

304
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,423
If you find, if you supposedly have senior designers

305
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:11,444
and you find yourself constantly mired in issues,

306
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,660
maybe they're not senior just because they've spent six years in the industry

307
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,261
doesn't necessarily make them a senior.

308
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,843
Maybe they haven't shipped enough games.

309
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:22,026
They haven't seen the life cycle of specific content or features enough

310
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:24,067
to know what problems happen early.

311
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,209
That can be that, you know, what problems will happen late

312
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:27,851
that are caused by decisions made early.

313
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:30,753
And it's important for them to have that experience in those types of areas.

314
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:33,576
So just because you have six years of experience doesn't just make you a senior

315
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:36,178
because maybe you haven't gotten the right type of experiences yet.

316
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,211
So on the technical design end, it's something that's a very valuable subset of design, but

317
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:46,334
it's an ugly, ambiguous term. In the course of interviews for this session, I got terms such as

318
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:49,776
like, they're just programmers who can design, they're programmers who can script, or maybe they

319
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:54,078
write tools, or they do something in Lua. Talking with multiple different designers at different

320
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,221
companies, I got very, very different definitions of what a technical designer job is, and it was

321
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:05,464
not consistent at all. So let's throw out what the job itself means. Let's focus on sort of like the

322
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,365
specific skills that

323
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,146
I want to say that I think technical designers

324
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:11,848
are designers that focus on improving how design builds

325
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:13,749
and delivers and features and content.

326
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,810
And I kind of view that as infrastructure design.

327
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,931
I don't think anyone wants to have a title

328
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,152
as infrastructure designer.

329
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:20,252
If you do, that's awesome.

330
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:21,613
And I like you a lot,

331
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:23,814
but most people probably don't want to be called

332
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,455
infrastructure designers, unfortunately.

333
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:28,036
But that's kind of the crux of really where they add value

334
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,398
and add sort of force multiplication to a project.

335
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:32,979
So infrastructure design would focus on things like tools,

336
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,120
standards, and process.

337
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,301
There's a little bit of overlap there with the process skill.

338
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,441
And let's talk about a little thing

339
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:38,222
I call the cake analogy.

340
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,123
And I stole this, I can't take credit for it,

341
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:40,883
but it's a good one.

342
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:43,444
So if designers are sort of like cooks in a kitchen

343
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:44,345
and they are making cakes,

344
00:14:44,345 --> 00:14:46,406
then their job is to deliver cakes to customers.

345
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:47,586
They're still programmers and artists,

346
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,027
and they're doing things like making ingredients,

347
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:50,548
you know, putting the frosting on the cake,

348
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:51,848
so they're very involved in the process too.

349
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:52,709
But designers are kind of the cook

350
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:53,609
that do a lot of the baking

351
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,550
and trying to get the ingredient mixes right

352
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,991
and cook it for just so long

353
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:58,492
to make it the tastiest possible cake.

354
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,022
In that role, technical designers make cake mixes.

355
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:02,243
They're more like prep chefs.

356
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:04,545
They're the ones who are gonna pre-make a lot of things.

357
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:05,866
So if you know you're gonna make a bunch of cakes

358
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,508
and people really like chocolate cakes,

359
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,990
you might wanna have a chocolate cake mix ready to go

360
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,452
so you can just churn out those cakes really fast.

361
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,954
And that's what technical designers will do.

362
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:16,795
They will build you those cake mixes

363
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:18,837
so you can churn out even more cakes

364
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:20,619
or higher quality and more consistent cakes.

365
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,900
And that's how they add efficiency.

366
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,861
They're making everyone else's work easier.

367
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,203
They're adding that valuable, valuable infrastructure.

368
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:32,216
Last up in terms of multiplayers, let's talk about multi-classing, that versatility aspect

369
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:37,300
of valuable seniors. So these are designers that can fulfill multiple roles. They add flexibility

370
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,964
to the team, not directly throughput, but because they kind of make up for like inefficiencies or

371
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:45,887
sometimes can speed things along, they kind of fight that whole corruption or waste or

372
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:50,650
inefficiency of that occurs in any kind of team, especially ones with, you know, like that, that

373
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,653
when you have to deal with a production issues and sometimes even very large teams.

374
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:58,681
So small teams and medium teams generally value this a little bit pretty highly because they may

375
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:02,463
not be able to staff every little subdiscipline. You know if you're a level designer and a systems

376
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:05,945
designer and you know every now and then you can jump between those two and do that work very

377
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:09,126
effectively that can be valuable because there are times when they may need a lot of level design

378
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,687
and times when they may need a lot of systems design.

379
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,928
And then on very large teams, as I talked about,

380
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:16,209
because there are oftentimes sort of waste issues,

381
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,669
it kind of comes back full circle.

382
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,970
Well, now having multiclass and versatile people,

383
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,210
they can plug them into strike teams or pods

384
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,951
or agile teams, et cetera, in ways to fill things out

385
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,852
that make that large, huge management version a little bit.

386
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,432
So it's kind of that middle tier

387
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:31,072
where you have enough people to be specialized

388
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,433
and you don't necessarily need multiclassers,

389
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,714
but in the small end, they're valuable and very large

390
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:36,854
and they can start being valuable again.

391
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:39,134
But it's very picky based on your company

392
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:39,955
and team structure.

393
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:46,662
So for multi-class designers, tips to you, don't sell yourself as multi-class because

394
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:48,563
you're probably not thinking about in the right ways.

395
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,824
It takes years of training to be a multi-class efficient.

396
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:56,206
You want to think yourself as basically being an effective staff level or near senior, or

397
00:16:56,206 --> 00:17:00,008
maybe, you know, you know, just the cusp of senior in both disciplines.

398
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:03,930
If you want to be say a level designer environment artist, which is sometimes a common overlap,

399
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,612
it means you kind of want to be capable of being a staff environment artist and a staff

400
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:08,632
level designer, or maybe a.

401
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:14,958
early senior level designer and a middle staff environment artist. That is tough.

402
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:20,023
That can take a career change or years of training in both or a lot of

403
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,464
individual practice within that one.

404
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:26,600
leaders, if someone is billing themselves as multi-class, be suspicious of those who

405
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,523
bill themselves as multi-class because a lot of times it means that they're underestimating.

406
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:33,765
They're basically saying, hey, I am a junior in two disciplines. I can do both junior quality

407
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:38,489
senior systems design work and junior quality level design work. But that's often not what

408
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:43,632
you need. You don't need two junior quality disciplines. You need them to be higher.

409
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:46,755
So if they truly are multi-class, they've often done.

410
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:50,496
both those jobs at some point in their career before they've had years of doing it.

411
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:54,317
And you can have that be part of the interview. You can say, cool, you think you're a level

412
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:57,618
designer environment artist. You will conduct part of the interview with the lead level designer

413
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,880
and part of the interview with the lead environment artist. They will review your portfolios in both

414
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,222
areas and grade you and you need to pass both to be quantified as a sort of senior multi-class person.

415
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:10,426
That's how strict you can get with that if you really want to grade that and allow it.

416
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:13,731
Some people will make it and they're fantastic, but a lot of people will start to realize how

417
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,595
serious you are about it when you say that they have to have portfolios in both,

418
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,818
and both will be graded by their respective disciplines.

419
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:24,263
So, GAP part one summary. Let's talk about the little bit on the mastery of design skills and

420
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:29,729
tool sets does not a senior make up just because you are really good with say items doesn't mean

421
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:33,754
that you're a senior yet. You have to demonstrate all those additional skills we've talked about

422
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:37,578
and again they'll come back up a lot. Senior designers also must routinely demonstrate

423
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:40,802
skills in these things which is ownership, mentorship, again the

424
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:44,084
vision, technical design, and multi-classing,

425
00:18:44,084 --> 00:18:45,785
all those things, and it gets routine.

426
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,346
It's about a good batting average.

427
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:49,847
It's not just about doing it once.

428
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:51,809
It's about consistently doing it

429
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,650
and really being able to showcase that,

430
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,492
that you can do it over and over again.

431
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:58,873
It's not a binary pass-fail thing.

432
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,364
So let's get into GAP part two, which we're going to talk about leads versus non-leads.

433
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:06,847
We've laid out some skills that are important for seniors, and leads often have a lot of these

434
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,131
twos. Obviously, things like mentorship and management seems right up a lead alley. So

435
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:14,755
how are all these force multiplier skills I talked about not just the aspects of being a lead?

436
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:19,040
Well, let's get into that. First off, leads, also a dirty and weird and ambiguous term that

437
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,723
lacks a lot of consistency within different companies and within the industry as a whole.

438
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:24,745
If you're a lead multiplayer designer,

439
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:26,125
are you leading multiplayer?

440
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,147
If you're the lead online designer, you're leading online.

441
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:31,088
Are you leading people or are you leading features?

442
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,769
It's a weird term there

443
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,071
because we kind of use the two somewhat interchangeably.

444
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:36,932
I've seen teams where they had a lead,

445
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:39,093
you know, lead person over a subset

446
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,734
and they had no one reporting underneath them.

447
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:43,395
So they were very much a feature lead and not a people lead.

448
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:46,297
So let's focus our discussion now on people leaders

449
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,858
because these are the people that we often see

450
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,559
as the ones who get promoted, things like.

451
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,182
lead designer or design director.

452
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,585
And that's more traditionally seen as sort of the

453
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,648
the end game for design careers right now,

454
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:57,529
where people are just like,

455
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,373
well, if you want to get to the tippy top of the design ladder,

456
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,555
you need to become a lead designer

457
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:02,976
or you need to become a design director

458
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:03,898
or something along those lines.

459
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,560
But that's let's start carving out spaces

460
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,242
for people who don't want to go down the people that are bad,

461
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:07,603
because.

462
00:20:08,003 --> 00:20:10,104
People leaders are really supervisors or managers.

463
00:20:10,104 --> 00:20:14,086
They lead people. It's not projects or features really.

464
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:17,187
What they're really focusing on is people and they're trying to grow people and improve on

465
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:21,510
people because people are your really speaking your your one of your best assets as developer.

466
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,452
They're one of your most important and growing your designers is great and it's very valuable.

467
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:28,733
It's sort of the force multiplier aspect of it's fairly obvious because they're making

468
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:32,955
your people more effective and that's such a huge part of your team structure.

469
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:32,995
So

470
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:37,017
People leaders now, they focus on a few of these sort of senior plus skills, which is

471
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:41,520
obviously the mentorship, one management ownership, and they have a expect to have vision.

472
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,521
But I'll note that, you know, you can't have good people leaders that don't always have

473
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:50,024
the greatest vision components if they're supported by other seniors on the team that

474
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,145
do have good vision components.

475
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:54,046
That's where you can get into some great dynamics where you can have a people leader that is

476
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:57,068
focusing more on the mentorship and owner side, and then non people leaders that are

477
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,909
focusing a little bit more on the vision and other areas, and you get that good combination.

478
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,730
The key thing there is when building a team is to have.

479
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:05,262
you know, combinatorial skill sets that really work together

480
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,891
and make the whole team better as a whole.

481
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:07,951
So.

482
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:11,824
This is a really more of a professional development skill focus.

483
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:13,764
The key thing to note is that a lot of people who have people

484
00:21:13,764 --> 00:21:17,405
who have skills have a tendency to get out of design at some point in their career

485
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:20,346
because they start to realize that, oh, I'm really good at leading groups,

486
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,086
not just designers, but I can lead whole teams.

487
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:24,987
And they often get out and go into things like production or business

488
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:28,307
or they find companies or sometimes they leave the gaming industry, unfortunately,

489
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:30,548
and just go on to to run groups at other industries

490
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:33,629
where they get on and sometimes paid more or just like the work better, et cetera.

491
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:35,489
So these translate well into other fields.

492
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:36,489
That's just kind of the natural hands.

493
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,670
That's why it's sometimes really hard to keep people leaders around.

494
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:44,171
And they're kind of like the design parents. Yeah, they're raising design children. They have to be

495
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:48,134
good cop and bad cop. They need to celebrate successes, but they also need to hold people

496
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:52,478
accountable. They got to be the disciplinarian sometimes too, which is not everyone's great at.

497
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:57,462
And I'll talk about some of these red flags now. You know, if you have leaders at your company,

498
00:21:57,462 --> 00:22:01,045
or you're trying to think about growing people into a leadership role, there's some red flags.

499
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:03,167
If they don't find much joy in the success of others.

500
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,248
it's going to be tough to be a people.

501
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:07,550
You know, you kind of want people that like to sort of like

502
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,511
play the minion class in RPGs

503
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:13,274
because they find joy in seeing other things succeed,

504
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,175
you know, because they're not going to get as much time

505
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,216
to be an individual contributor themselves.

506
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,878
So they have to really find some level of joy

507
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:22,019
in what other people do and when they succeed

508
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:23,560
and growing them to be more successful.

509
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,622
They also can't be the type that are easily flustered by juniors or non-experts

510
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:30,003
because they're gonna have to deal with juniors, especially quite a lot, so they

511
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:33,044
gotta, you know, enjoy training those juniors up to become even just staff

512
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:35,305
level people. It's gonna be a large portion of their career.

513
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:39,595
And if they focus either too much on celebration or discipline, it can lead to some problems.

514
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:42,337
Everyone kind of generally starts on those. Some people are like, yeah, you're awesome.

515
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:45,820
We're really good. But could you please not do that? Or they're like, no, everything you do

516
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,223
is not good enough. Do things better. Here's 10 things you're doing wrong. Improve on those. And

517
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:52,825
you need to find people that have a good balance and that can do both of those.

518
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:55,927
I think people generally start from either celebrant or disciplinarian side,

519
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,789
and they need to grow towards the other. And good people leaders recognize which

520
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:01,691
side they start on, and they work really hard to grow towards the other.

521
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,982
And lastly, be careful people who are reluctant to make the hard staffing decisions.

522
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:09,562
And that doesn't mean just like firing people that sometimes is part of being a people leader job.

523
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:13,603
It sometimes can also mean hiring when you have two very valuable candidates and they have to

524
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:16,864
choose between. There can be a lot of heartache there. You know, it's not difficult to say you

525
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:20,885
get the job, you go thrown out in the cold. And that can cause a lot of emotional stress.

526
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:24,146
So if they're really reluctant and it really wears them down, you know,

527
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:28,827
it's going to grate on them too much and it's going to make their jobs unenjoyable in the long run.

528
00:23:29,627 --> 00:23:33,850
On the ownership side, there's some red flags here where if you're not good at breaking work into discrete steps,

529
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,791
or your people, you currently have a people lead that are doing that.

530
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,873
Odds are maybe they're not the greatest person to be your people leads.

531
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:42,596
Or if they're uncomfortable around non-designers or uninformed audiences,

532
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:46,619
that's also a problem because people leaders have a tendency to have to explain gameplay things

533
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:51,483
to artists, programmers, QA, producers, even producers outside or within your own company,

534
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:52,583
sometimes business partners.

535
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:53,864
And that's kind of their job.

536
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,905
They constantly have to deal with uninformed audiences.

537
00:23:56,905 --> 00:23:59,546
And that can be exasperating and tiring for some people

538
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:01,667
when they are just constantly explaining the basics

539
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:02,708
over and over again.

540
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,468
So you need people that are resilient to that.

541
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:06,509
And you also need to kind of deal with anyone

542
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,690
that struggles to identify efficiency problems again

543
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,871
because those process skills are so important

544
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:11,891
in getting a team to be efficient.

545
00:24:12,192 --> 00:24:13,233
and working really quick.

546
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,934
You need people that can understand

547
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,156
how to work a little bit with tools,

548
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:17,397
understand working with process,

549
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:18,898
understand how to work with other departments

550
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:19,519
to expedite things.

551
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,621
Like, hey, going back, like we're gonna build this level,

552
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:22,261
but we need concepts,

553
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,223
meaning those concepts need to be done three months from now.

554
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:25,525
So get us those concepts early.

555
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:26,385
They need to be able to identify

556
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,507
those efficiency improvements in your process

557
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:29,869
and help drive them forward.

558
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:30,029
So.

559
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:35,510
Last thing talking about leadership, then we'll jettison the leadership conversation and get back to focusing more on non leads

560
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,191
but

561
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:41,852
Staff ranks have different costs on sort of on the leadership burden and so if you're a juniors like 20% staff

562
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:47,173
Maybe 15% senior 10% the numbers a little fuzzy and it kind of depends some juniors cost more some seniors cost less etc

563
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:52,875
But point being is that if you have a team and say they have four juniors on it and they have a senior on

564
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,455
It that is a 90% cost on that lead

565
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:57,977
they are not going to get much individual contribution to work on and they're going to

566
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:03,018
spend a bunch of their time, not micromanaging, but managing, supervising, reviewing, and planning

567
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:07,400
for the work of those people. And that's largely their job. And so if you have someone

568
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,741
that's great with 90% leader versions, cool, throw them on that team.

569
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,262
But say we have Team Omega, which is zero juniors,

570
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,224
a couple of staff and a couple of seniors,

571
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,865
that's maybe only really about a 65 percent cost in the lead.

572
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:20,627
And they're going to get to do some small amount of individual contribution work.

573
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:24,329
So this might be a better team for someone who's not as experienced a people leader

574
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:27,431
and, you know, isn't quite ready to just give up entirely

575
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:28,992
on being a strong individual contributor.

576
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:32,457
And when you're growing people leaders, it's pretty basic.

577
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:35,039
Calculate that rough percent cost of your people leader,

578
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,180
start them at a small percent, and work them up to 100%.

579
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,801
Eventually, they'll get to the point

580
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:40,082
to where they don't get to do

581
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,383
any individual contribution work,

582
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:43,444
and they spend all day planning and reviewing.

583
00:25:43,444 --> 00:25:46,446
And that's what happens to a lot of people leaders

584
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,327
within the design industry.

585
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:50,449
That's sort of the grim reality of the whole thing.

586
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:51,249
But in any case.

587
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:58,101
The reality is that you've got to remember, please, that managing juniors is not the same

588
00:25:58,101 --> 00:25:58,962
as managing seniors.

589
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:02,905
That's an easy mistake that a lot of people make, and it's very important for leadership

590
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:06,688
as you are appointing people to people leadership positions.

591
00:26:06,688 --> 00:26:08,609
I understand that managing juniors is a lot harder.

592
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,912
You may manage a team of five and be extremely high burden, or you may be managing a team

593
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:14,993
of five seniors and have extremely low burden.

594
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:18,345
But where does this lead the non people leaders?

595
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:21,306
And so let's talk about the super secret staffing note.

596
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:24,927
It's not that secret, but it's important to call attention to is that most designers

597
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:29,349
and I believe, honestly, most developers genuinely don't want to be people leaders

598
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,830
as much as we tell the being design lead or being the design director

599
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,171
as the ultimate career path for a designer.

600
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:37,532
That's not actually what a lot of designers do.

601
00:26:37,852 --> 00:26:42,436
Instead, what they really want is the agency and the power that comes with a lead title

602
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:47,279
or role, but they don't want the burdens of being a real supervisor or manager all the

603
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:47,559
time.

604
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,280
That causes other problems.

605
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,405
So that leads to some issues because few designers really want to give up on being individual

606
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:59,127
entirely give up on being individual contributors to focus purely on management.

607
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:02,690
They can do other things besides individual contribution work, but but managing people

608
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,052
maybe isn't their strength, but they still want to be a force multiplier.

609
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:05,092
So

610
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:05,692
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

611
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:09,234
Non-people leaders not want to be supervisors or managers.

612
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:12,276
How can we grow them to be effective force multipliers?

613
00:27:12,276 --> 00:27:14,457
Well, there's a few things.

614
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:16,478
Non-people leaders need to become effective

615
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:19,660
force multipliers by improving everyone's efficiency,

616
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,541
quality, and ability to take risks,

617
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,302
not just their own, everyone's.

618
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:25,843
That's where these values come in.

619
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,904
Again, we're talking about force multipliers here.

620
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,925
They still expand outside of their individual

621
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,947
contribution work and make the team,

622
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,307
project, tools, et cetera, better.

623
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:33,347
So.

624
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,012
Let's hang on, sorry, repeat here.

625
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:38,073
And this is how they're going to do it.

626
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,955
They're going to do it through these types of skills here.

627
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:43,457
These people leaders generally focus on process,

628
00:27:43,457 --> 00:27:47,821
which is a little bit of overlap with your people leaders.

629
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:50,323
They're going to do it through visions for that architecture component,

630
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:52,124
which is again, also sometimes share with leaders,

631
00:27:52,124 --> 00:27:55,707
but they have often opportunities to be stronger at it.

632
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,270
And they can also do it through things like technical design,

633
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,290
which is that infrastructure.

634
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,993
And then if they can, maybe they can be a multi-class where they can really fit in.

635
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:06,394
So now we'll get into sort of the bulk of this we're going to talk about, which is Act 3,

636
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:11,495
growing force multipliers. How do we grow some force multipliers? Well, let's go back to that

637
00:28:11,495 --> 00:28:15,536
skill list once again. I promised I'd bring it up a lot, so let's do it one more time. We've got

638
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:20,637
ownership, we've got mentorship, we've got vision, we've got technical design, and we've got

639
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:25,778
multi-class. We're going to talk a little bit about each of these categories and how we can grow each

640
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:30,920
of them to make for better designers. So starting off with ownership, let's talk about non-people

641
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,640
leader ownership.

642
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,241
So non-people leaders still contribute to ownership.

643
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:36,622
You can't whiz your way out of it that easy,

644
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:37,603
senior designers.

645
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:40,204
You still have to help define, maintain

646
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:42,025
all the various process and pipelines

647
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:45,047
that the studio company project is going to use.

648
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,968
The reality is then in growing leadership,

649
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:50,309
to do that, you need your non-people leaders

650
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:52,170
to participate in some key pipeline stages.

651
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,211
such as kickoffs or pitches,

652
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:56,372
various entrance and executory definitions

653
00:28:56,372 --> 00:28:58,412
for intermediary pipeline stages,

654
00:28:58,412 --> 00:28:59,893
and also sort of the follow-ups,

655
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:02,473
things like postmortems, retrospectives,

656
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:03,614
other things that you may do at the end

657
00:29:03,614 --> 00:29:04,854
to quantify how well you did.

658
00:29:04,854 --> 00:29:06,435
And the more they're involved in all of those, the better.

659
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:07,855
I'll talk about a couple of them,

660
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,455
but for something like postmortems, retrospectives,

661
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,736
there are literally whole GDC sessions

662
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:13,917
on just on how to do good postmortems and retrospectives,

663
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,937
a lot of learning materials on those.

664
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,618
I recommend looking at those if you want to know more.

665
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,302
So kickoffs and pitches.

666
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:21,164
Key things here is to define the boundaries,

667
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:23,726
the features and content amongst the team stakeholders

668
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:26,449
while before you sort of turn something over to a senior.

669
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:29,051
You know, give them some deadlines, give them resources.

670
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:30,153
You know, if it really takes progress on us,

671
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:32,315
give them to them and then set a target audience,

672
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:34,817
whether it's a subset of people within your game

673
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:36,739
or an audience that you'd like to hit.

674
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,621
It's important to establish those boundaries with them

675
00:29:38,621 --> 00:29:40,343
and then sort of see how the seniors go from there

676
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,864
when they do these kicks off and pitches after that.

677
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:45,066
Getting seniors involved or prospective seniors involved

678
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,067
in kickoffs and pitches helps them develop

679
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:47,948
that sense of agency.

680
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:51,049
Even if they're not the people leader or the design lead,

681
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:52,810
if they can be involved in kickoff and pitches,

682
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,371
that's what's helping to grow that sense of agency

683
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,852
and make them feel like they're doing something.

684
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:56,892
And they'll start to care,

685
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:57,913
as well as when they're involved

686
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,514
in these early stages of features.

687
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:00,735
It starts to let them understand

688
00:30:00,735 --> 00:30:03,456
what things go well during a kickoff or pitch

689
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:04,737
that leads to better results in the end.

690
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,918
This is all part of that whole becoming a vaccine

691
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:07,938
instead of just a cure.

692
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:08,919
You gotta be involved early

693
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,360
if you wanna become a vaccine eventually.

694
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:16,652
So pipeline stages now require non-leads to help define pipeline stages, resist the temptation to

695
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:20,035
just always make the lead be the guy that has to do it. You know, if you have questions like,

696
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:24,859
what does a level designer need to start building a white box? Your senior level designers should

697
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:28,963
be able to answer that question. Same thing a little bit is like, what does environment art

698
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,825
need once the level designer is done to keep things going?

699
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:34,269
Yeah, your senior level designers should be able to help answer that too.

700
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,073
And if they haven't, they need to start exploring conversations with

701
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:41,118
environmentists and develop that interdepartment communication skills.

702
00:30:41,118 --> 00:30:43,401
Those are key things to becoming a force multiplier.

703
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,805
They take some of the burden off of your people leaders in these areas

704
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,267
by being able to do these sorts of things.

705
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:54,632
And on the mentorship end, let's talk about growing mentorship now on non-people leaders.

706
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:58,834
So growing mentorship, teaching seniors to be teachers.

707
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:02,797
It's important and you can do this through a couple simple things such as the buddy system,

708
00:31:02,797 --> 00:31:04,638
peer reviews, and presentations.

709
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:07,580
All right, let's move on now to the buddy system.

710
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:13,068
So the buddy system, this is where we pair prospective seniors with juniors.

711
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:18,489
And this is going to be useful because you can train them on things like standards and organization,

712
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:22,390
process and pipelines, and as well as just team dynamics. Who do you go to to answer x question?

713
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,752
Who's the most important artist to know when these issues raise up? And there's a lot of value to

714
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:31,833
this because a lot of times this falls on leads and doesn't have to. Juniors are often seen as

715
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,214
burdens, unfortunately, where it's like, well, there's this new guy coming in, he's an entry

716
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:37,895
level and so and so, and no one wants to deal with them. But

717
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:39,556
That's the wrong attitude.

718
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,059
These are great training opportunities for seniors.

719
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,562
This is a chance for them to get real mentorship experience.

720
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:49,133
So resist the temptation to make the leads always do it.

721
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:52,315
Utilize your seniors or prospective seniors to handle this

722
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,196
and make sure you grade the results.

723
00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:55,597
When you get done with like buddy systems

724
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,578
and you're training people up in this method,

725
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:58,879
talk to the buddies,

726
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:01,180
both the senior and whoever they were being a buddy with

727
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,401
and evaluate how well they did.

728
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:05,103
Get feedback and then work with the senior to improve on it.

729
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:05,823
Let them know, it's like,

730
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:07,324
hey, this guy thought you did good this

731
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,725
or thought you did well on that.

732
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:09,806
And that's the real crux of it.

733
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,306
You really want people to understand

734
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,507
how they can do these things better.

735
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:18,272
So moving on next to peer reviews. So recurring peer reviews are a great thing. Do them say like

736
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:22,295
you know every other Friday or every Friday etc. Have people go in and look at work. It's just a

737
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:26,238
great way to you know get your team to see each other's works and builds cooperation and sort of

738
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:30,462
like good practices between shared between everyone. But also remember to like landmark

739
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:34,585
peer reviews and important risks even if it's a senior or non-senior and your seniors can participate

740
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,388
it's like hey we've got this staff guy he's doing this thing it's a little risky.

741
00:32:37,828 --> 00:32:41,069
halfway through, you know, please jump in there and take a look at how he's doing it

742
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:44,950
to make sure that things are staying on track. But I'm gonna have a rant on coming here and

743
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,511
this is the only rant I've really got but I'm gonna do a rant on peer reviews here real quick.

744
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:52,092
So number one, peer reviews are not only supposed to be done at the end. Like I said,

745
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:56,813
with risky things you need to do them earlier on. Don't wait till the end to only do your peer reviews.

746
00:32:57,193 --> 00:32:58,393
Number two is up there.

747
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,814
Peer reviews are not just playtests.

748
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:02,554
If you were only looking at things

749
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:04,415
from a playability standpoint,

750
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,775
you are not doing a correct peer review.

751
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,956
You need to go in and look at how things are built.

752
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:09,336
You need to critique standards,

753
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:11,337
comments, usage, reliability.

754
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:12,977
The how is what is critically important

755
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:13,838
as part of the peer review.

756
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,918
It's so great, yes, you still want to critique the what.

757
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,179
You don't ignore that,

758
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:19,079
but you can't have an effective peer review

759
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:20,900
that doesn't look at how things were built.

760
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,100
Especially with more junior or younger people,

761
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,061
you have to critique everything from standards,

762
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:26,842
commentary, again, all that kind of stuff.

763
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,744
get in there, look at the how and make sure you're doing a job with that.

764
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:33,947
Okay, rant on peer reviews over. Move on to the next section which can help

765
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:36,909
training grow your leadership, which will be on presentations. There's lots of

766
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:39,631
presentations that people can give. I know sometimes they don't like to,

767
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:42,993
but this is part about getting those communication skills up and educating

768
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:45,315
people. And some of this is for things like tools demonstrations.

769
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,257
Have them go in and just demonstrate how perhaps tools are used,

770
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:51,440
and that may not be well known, maybe they're more edge casey, but you know,

771
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,921
get that familiarity built with the rest of the team.

772
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,804
Competitive analysis. You want to add a battle pass to your game.

773
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:58,427
Have them do competitive analysis and have them present it.

774
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,589
Not just write a document that they throw over the fence.

775
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,632
Actually get up and talk to designers and non-designers about it.

776
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:08,188
Gameplay concepts, you want to pitch new modes, risky new things. Again, do some exploration

777
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:12,990
early on and have them do presentations about it to educate the team. And then training videos,

778
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,672
update your training videos. Have your seniors or prospective seniors like, hey, we know you're

779
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:20,674
really good with X and you're wanting to grow up to be a senior, so let's have you train other

780
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:23,776
people by making a new set of training videos with it and see how good you really are.

781
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:27,539
And to note, once again, target presentations at other disciplines too.

782
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:31,302
You know, do some of these things like competitive analysis or training videos that will benefit

783
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:37,186
non-designers, artists, programmers, QA, etc. Make them broaden their horizon and ensure that they

784
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:40,809
can communicate well with other departments. That doesn't mean changing their lingo. It means not

785
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:43,331
trying to be an expert and talk only in expertise. It's about

786
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:47,675
building bridges, you need to take your expertise up here

787
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:50,217
and all the other people in your company that are way down here

788
00:34:50,217 --> 00:34:51,618
and build that bridge.

789
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:54,040
You know, we don't need a whole bunch of people to sit up high

790
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,682
and, you know, lower their expertise over what we don't need

791
00:34:56,682 --> 00:34:58,204
a tyranny of subject matter experts.

792
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:01,887
We need designers that help build other subject matter experts.

793
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:06,293
Let's go into vision here. This is a tough one because vision relates to architecture,

794
00:35:06,293 --> 00:35:09,914
relates to foundational building a lot of key elements and for the hardest and riskiest skills to build,

795
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:14,155
but also one of the most vital for all people to be forced multipliers to other one.

796
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:18,416
And there are entire GDCI sessions that talk on ways of sort of growing this and what you can do.

797
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,397
That relates to things like prototyping, it relates to things like finding the fun,

798
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:25,378
iteration and affordances, all those types of things.

799
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:27,661
you can find tons and tons of educational materials

800
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:29,403
that'll show you like, this is how you do effective

801
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:30,225
and time box prototyping,

802
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:31,927
or this is how you can work on affordances.

803
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:34,010
I'll go into a few of these to talk a little bit about it,

804
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,973
but there's a lot of educational material related

805
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,695
just on growing vision and things you can do

806
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:38,656
within your teams on those.

807
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,661
Gameplay insight. For example, taking gameplay from average to good is often the key goal of

808
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:49,023
what a designer has if they actually have sort of this good vision or good architecture skills.

809
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:52,224
That does not mean that you need to take everything from average to good. There's

810
00:35:52,224 --> 00:35:56,405
this misconception that seniors or principals or experts are so good that they'll take all

811
00:35:56,405 --> 00:36:01,047
of your gameplay features from nearly average to good. In reality, they're going to take the key

812
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:04,748
elements of your game from average to good. If you're an action game, that's probably going to

813
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,970
be something like combat mechanics, gunplay, swordplay, whatever the case may be.

814
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,351
If you're doing a puzzle game, it's probably something like puzzles.

815
00:36:11,351 --> 00:36:15,753
That's a key aspect of your game and it needs to be good, if not great or excellent.

816
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:20,055
And designers that have that sort of vision or share will understand to put their emphasis

817
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,336
on those key areas and they will propel them upwards. And there's ways that they do it again.

818
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:24,817
cover a little bit of those,

819
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:26,138
but let's talk a little bit about affordances.

820
00:36:26,138 --> 00:36:27,500
And affordances are a lot of type

821
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,861
of small gameplay improvements

822
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,322
that allow you to do things better.

823
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,603
The classic examples in a lot of platformers,

824
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:34,705
after your character steps off of a platform,

825
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:37,407
they have a small window, say a 10th of a second,

826
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,489
in which the player can still press the jump button

827
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,370
and the character will just jump in the air.

828
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,491
That's an affordance.

829
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,212
It makes the game feel more usable,

830
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:46,574
even though you're cheating the physics

831
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:49,036
and cheating the simulation

832
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:50,817
to make the game more playable

833
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,098
and do what the player wants.

834
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:54,120
And that is a key part of iterating all gameplay.

835
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,281
And everybody that has good vision understands the search for those.

836
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,083
So designers won't know everything in advance, though, about what

837
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,243
affordances they need to find.

838
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:03,444
However, they should know some of the affordances.

839
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:06,346
If they literally know none of the affordances, then they're probably

840
00:37:06,346 --> 00:37:09,128
not the person that has vision that area, you know, especially if you switch

841
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:11,129
genres, if you switch from working on strategy games to shooters,

842
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,450
you're not going to know the affordances and shooters.

843
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,111
And you've got to do some research and some education to find the basic

844
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:16,551
ones quick.

845
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:18,492
You know that there's gonna be more of them.

846
00:37:18,492 --> 00:37:19,672
Good seniors understand like,

847
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,053
oh God, we've got to find more of these

848
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:22,753
as quickly and as efficiently as possible.

849
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,533
That's what all those GDC presentations are about

850
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,294
is using that iteration and prototyping time

851
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:29,495
to find those affordances fast and efficient.

852
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:30,975
So you're gonna need to set aside time

853
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:32,615
to help find these affordances

854
00:37:32,615 --> 00:37:33,816
and you're gonna need people to train on that,

855
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:35,076
but that's how you kind of grow that skillset

856
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:36,977
is literally through practice and experience.

857
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:41,000
Audience wise, key thing for designers to understand is that non-senior designers

858
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,263
often badly assume, unfortunately, that they are the audience.

859
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:50,508
They or someone like them is the audience. And that's kind of, again,

860
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:54,031
not really how all games are targeted. The reality is that a lot of our games don't.

861
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:58,556
have a single audience and number two, sometimes the designers aren't even the core audience there

862
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:02,541
and senior plus designers generally focus on like audience questions they want to know

863
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:06,665
what games is our audience play what are their play sessions like do they play for 15 minutes

864
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:09,709
do they play for 45 minutes that's that kind of information is really going to help you target

865
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:13,934
do you make a 30 minute dungeon or a 60 minute dungeon if your sessions on average are only 15

866
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:14,434
minutes long.

867
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,576
Don't be making 60 minute dungeons.

868
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:19,937
So, and then they also ask things like

869
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:21,738
how many different audiences plays our game?

870
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:22,758
Cryptic works on a lot of MMOs

871
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,939
and we've discussed a lot like Bartles Taxonomy

872
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:27,460
and the different types of players that affect it.

873
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,761
You know, people who like mastery,

874
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:30,342
people who like social elements.

875
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,462
You're not gonna have just one audience in any given game,

876
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:33,683
especially big games.

877
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:36,504
The bigger the game, the more types of audiences you have.

878
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:37,945
And it's important to understand

879
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:39,866
that your game will appeal to different audiences

880
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:41,807
and that different features will target them.

881
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:43,768
Seniors get that and they will ask questions

882
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:44,308
to discern that.

883
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:49,318
Now for growing vision, once again, it can be trained slowly, it can be trained through education,

884
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:53,559
again, GDC, YouTube, educational videos, I'll call out to extra credits in the Game Makers

885
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,760
Toolkit. They have a lot of starting, great starting points there. It can be done through

886
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,801
practical experience, build those prototypes, carve out time just to build prototypes. Even

887
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:02,982
if they don't succeed, you'll gain experience doing that.

888
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:06,485
Focus tests, though, are excellent for, you know,

889
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:08,286
growing your designer's appreciation of an audience.

890
00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:10,048
There's nothing like seeing a designer

891
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,270
watch someone struggle to play their level

892
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,511
that grows their appreciation

893
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:14,952
of who their audience really is.

894
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,013
So leverage those.

895
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:17,654
Sometimes that's just there for the experience.

896
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:19,716
Even if it doesn't necessarily make the game a ton better,

897
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:20,697
it will help your designer

898
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:21,878
understand their audiences better.

899
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,079
And last thing, workshops.

900
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:24,900
And this isn't necessarily just like GDC workshops.

901
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,082
This is like you can run workshops within your company,

902
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:28,723
get all your level designers together,

903
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:31,165
give them two days, have them pick up subject material,

904
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:34,027
do sort of like a prototype or a game jam on it,

905
00:39:34,027 --> 00:39:36,669
and then sit them and have them do review results

906
00:39:36,669 --> 00:39:38,970
and see if the visions that they chose

907
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,552
and then attempted to execute on that window worked out.

908
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:42,853
And if not, why not?

909
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:43,894
And what they learned from it.

910
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:45,455
And that's the way you can kind of like iterate

911
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:47,197
in small microcosms and lower risk ways

912
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:47,997
on growing that vision.

913
00:39:48,757 --> 00:39:53,382
So growing through failure, good news, bad news is that failure is often a great way to learn vision

914
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:59,447
and it's also kind of costly on projects and teams. So projects need opportunities for designers to

915
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:05,333
risk failure to grow. And the thing though is you can't kill the project because they took risk. So

916
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,256
you need to fall and skin your knees but not break the project's legs in the process.

917
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:12,438
So there's not every feature you can afford necessarily

918
00:40:12,438 --> 00:40:14,119
to take big risks on.

919
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,441
So don't be upset if your team doesn't want you

920
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,243
to take big risks on like a very important core combat.

921
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,704
The number of big risks you take is often limited

922
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:24,165
by the number of very vision heavy

923
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,687
and trustworthy seniors that you have that can absorb that.

924
00:40:26,687 --> 00:40:28,348
If you've got one guy in your team

925
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,448
that's got really good vision,

926
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:31,129
that really limits the number of risks you can take.

927
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,250
If you've got four guys that are really good vision

928
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,011
and understand that,

929
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:36,012
you're gonna be able to take a lot more effective risks.

930
00:40:37,242 --> 00:40:41,925
Let's go into technical design or as I wish I could sometimes call it infrastructure design here.

931
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,987
So let's harken back to the cake mix example.

932
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:50,351
We talked about how dev teams are delivering cakes and designers are the cooks trying to make those cakes.

933
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:53,733
And technical designers are the sort of the prep cooks.

934
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:57,155
They're trying to make consistency and efficiency of cake production better.

935
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:02,259
And this is how they become a force multipliers that they're just making everybody's work again, efficient or better quality.

936
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:02,299
So.

937
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:07,326
With that in mind, how do you grow this sort of infrastructural design or technical design? It's

938
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:11,308
fairly easy. Again, it's largely practice. But what are some of the things that you're going to

939
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:15,569
want to practice? Well, let's talk about standards. This is a bit of overlap with process here.

940
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:20,510
Incorporate them in things like file and folder naming standards and make them handle enforcement

941
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,811
of it. Make them actually say, OK, we are going to put files like this. Our folds will be used

942
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:26,292
like this. As we put new things in the game, they need to adhere to these standards.

943
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,495
and they will monitor other designers, content designers,

944
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:31,897
systems designers, whatever the case you may have,

945
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:33,558
they're gonna monitor that and enforce it,

946
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,641
report errors, perhaps work with a tech on tools

947
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:37,922
to validate naming automatically.

948
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:39,704
They'll do things like data organization,

949
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:41,245
Hark again, they'll have that level of vision

950
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:42,747
where they're thinking, hey, we're like, okay,

951
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:43,948
we have 10 of these things

952
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,369
and maybe our naming structure works for 10 of them,

953
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,471
but when we have a thousand of them,

954
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,152
will this still hold up or not?

955
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:53,316
not. And they'll be able to guide you to data structures that will service the

956
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:57,379
long game. You know, just because a naming structure or data hierarchy is good and

957
00:41:57,379 --> 00:42:00,542
fast and simple to use when there's ten things, doesn't mean it's gonna stay that

958
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:03,345
way for long. And you don't want to commit to a naming structure that

959
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:06,167
buckles at the end of the project because you wanted one that was really

960
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,588
efficient early on for prototyping.

961
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:11,152
So, growing technical design also in the tools end.

962
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,514
They can obviously, you know, help with things like data entry automation.

963
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,377
They can point out if they know how to actually build scripts,

964
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:17,599
they can just build possibly some scripts to do that.

965
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,661
That's more on the coding side, but it's not a requirement.

966
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:22,044
They can, however, oppositely just sort of be a tech liaison

967
00:42:22,044 --> 00:42:24,867
where they can work with people who do make some of those tools

968
00:42:24,867 --> 00:42:26,249
and they can quantify the value.

969
00:42:26,249 --> 00:42:27,691
And this is a big difference.

970
00:42:28,051 --> 00:42:32,433
being a tech liaison in this sense is not just about saying like, we could use a tool that does x

971
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:36,115
and then you write up a JIRA or something and send it over and forget about it. It's more about like,

972
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:41,237
okay, hey, this is what we need. This is how we do. This is our workflow. This is how we could

973
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:47,100
save time. If we could automate these first 10 steps of this data entry, we'll save say 5,

974
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,022
15 or 20 minutes per designer per instance. And we're probably going to do this like.

975
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,643
600 or 700 times over the course of the project.

976
00:42:52,643 --> 00:42:56,105
So we can save a bunch of time if we do this in the first few months,

977
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:59,047
they'll target need, value, best time to do it on.

978
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:00,328
They'll even be able to tell you like,

979
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,369
oh, we can't get to this tool for seven months.

980
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:04,931
Well, that's too late. We'll have all the data entered by that point.

981
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,152
There's no point in making the tool for this project.

982
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,514
Maybe a future project would value for that, but they'll know.

983
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:11,075
That's what a good tech liaison does,

984
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:13,136
and that's where this infrastructure design can focus on.

985
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:14,617
They're good at being that tech liaison.

986
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:18,838
And there are also tools users documentation and make them do practical examples.

987
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:22,599
For example, you're making a game where you have spells that blast things.

988
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,700
For example, have them do tools users documentation or videos that shows like this is how you

989
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,020
would build a simple fireball.

990
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,321
This is how you would build a lightning bolt that flies down from the sky and hits targets.

991
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:35,982
There's a lot of different things that you could do with this, but have them do practical.

992
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:37,242
It's not just, here's how you open the editor.

993
00:43:37,924 --> 00:43:40,270
here's how you open the data editor.

994
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:40,832
No, no, no, no.

995
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:41,694
Actually make, you know,

996
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:43,058
have them do practical demonstrations

997
00:43:43,058 --> 00:43:43,960
of how to build things

998
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,106
that would seemingly have value in the game.

999
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,555
Last year here with growing technical design, let's talk a little bit on the gameplay side.

1000
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:51,797
There's a couple of things here that they can do on the infrastructure level.

1001
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:56,841
There are developer maps and developer maps are a type of map that the players do not see,

1002
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,403
but you maintain throughout all of development.

1003
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:03,146
They do not go out in external facing builds, but they are always maintained.

1004
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:06,949
They are free from errors and you use them to sort of test features,

1005
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,070
content, new developments, etc.

1006
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:14,174
However, there's a very bad term called test maps and some people say oh, this is my test map because I put this together

1007
00:44:14,174 --> 00:44:15,835
I kit bashed a bunch of art into it

1008
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:19,878
It's spewing out errors and I'm gonna have to delete it in two weeks when they change a bunch of the art

1009
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:24,141
That's not a developer map. You're not gonna maintain that map. That is a temporary map

1010
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:27,324
that will be deleted shortly because it's not worth trying to maintain.

1011
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:28,044
It's too expensive.

1012
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:32,188
Developer maps are maintained maps that are not,

1013
00:44:32,188 --> 00:44:35,411
again, not shown to an external audience, but you'll have them forever

1014
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:37,773
and they'll survive the launch of the game.

1015
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:40,135
And if you go into future games, you may even use them on future projects.

1016
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,598
That's a great thing for technical designers to build and own.

1017
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:48,093
Last thing is also archetypes, prefabs, or any kind of like pre-made construction,

1018
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:52,977
library piece, blueprint, whatever the case may be. If you, for example, want to have like random

1019
00:44:52,977 --> 00:44:57,181
encounters in your game, you could have every designer in every unique case script a choice

1020
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:58,282
between one to four monsters.

1021
00:44:58,502 --> 00:45:01,203
Or if your project supports things like archetypes and prefabs,

1022
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:04,704
you can have a technical designer build you a sort of prefab

1023
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:06,344
that randomly picks between a set of monsters.

1024
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:08,725
And so the designers are placing that prefab everywhere

1025
00:45:08,725 --> 00:45:10,345
and the technical designer owns that prefab,

1026
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:12,026
updates it as new monster types comes out,

1027
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:14,027
maybe removes ones that aren't working

1028
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:15,787
and iterates a little bit on that prefab.

1029
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:17,487
He's not iterating on the level,

1030
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:19,628
but he is iterating on a piece that's reused in the level.

1031
00:45:19,628 --> 00:45:21,329
That's a great little infrastructural saving

1032
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:23,829
and quality improvement that a technical design can add.

1033
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:25,390
Now again, infrastructure design.

1034
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:28,022
So let's move on here now.

1035
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:31,024
So we got to the last section where we're going to go into multiclass,

1036
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:35,387
one of the hardest, most challenging aspects of sort of being a senior

1037
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:37,848
plus to quantify because it breaks a lot of hearts again.

1038
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:41,830
So the grim reality is that there are few opportunities

1039
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,091
to grow multiclass designers.

1040
00:45:43,091 --> 00:45:47,574
They are usually the sort of result of a need within a project or a team.

1041
00:45:47,574 --> 00:45:49,795
Small developers often have it because they realize, ah,

1042
00:45:49,795 --> 00:45:52,577
we need a little bit more systems manpower.

1043
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:55,318
Let's have this content designer level designer do some systems real quick.

1044
00:45:55,899 --> 00:45:57,120
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

1045
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,421
He'll do that for six months.

1046
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,163
Or it can become out of very large developers,

1047
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:01,924
again, where there's a lot of process.

1048
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:02,645
And it's like, you know,

1049
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:04,967
having some versatile people that can do stuff,

1050
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:08,510
save us from having to like transfer people

1051
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:09,591
between strike pods or teams,

1052
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:10,572
where if we just can have like a guy

1053
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,314
that can do a bit of systems and a bit of level design

1054
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:13,835
on all of our sort of design ones,

1055
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:15,857
it really saves us a lot of headache

1056
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:16,878
on a very large management end.

1057
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:19,660
So, you know, there's different opportunities to get there,

1058
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,482
but it's hard to necessarily get those.

1059
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:27,807
Sometimes, as noted earlier, it requires a career change to really grow as a multiclass and to build that versatility.

1060
00:46:27,807 --> 00:46:33,130
It might require you to do a career change for a while, which might mean that you have to do a completely different job for a bit.

1061
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,993
There's also battlefield promotions, which I'll talk about in its own little separate section here.

1062
00:46:36,993 --> 00:46:41,116
But let's talk about changing careers for just a second, because career changes can be good.

1063
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:44,739
They can improve happiness of what a developer, even if that means that they're leaving design.

1064
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:48,321
You know, if a designer, a level designer says, I'd really rather be an environment.

1065
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:51,223
OK, cool. Let's see what we can make happen, you know, long term wise.

1066
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,824
that's what's going to make you into effective seniors.

1067
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:55,565
That the fact that you will do more environment art

1068
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:56,946
and maybe you can assist on the level design side,

1069
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:59,947
you'll have a great unique perspective as an environment artist

1070
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:00,947
once you become a good environment artist

1071
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:02,048
because you'll understand level design,

1072
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:04,429
you'll understand more things about collision and readability

1073
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,049
and that'll make you an awesome environment artist.

1074
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:08,090
You'll be super effective as an environment artist because of that.

1075
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:08,270
But...

1076
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:14,655
The reality is sometimes if you have to change a career, you might have to accept a pay cut and start over at the bottom.

1077
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:25,041
Just because if your company is to say like a one to ten ranking of designers and you are a rank five designer and you decide to go become an environmentist, you might have to start over at a rank one or two environment artist.

1078
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:36,708
And that might mean you have to take a pay cut because it might take you years to get back up to the equivalent of a rank five environmentist to where you finally have that parity, where you're sort of an effective staff level at both environment and at level design.

1079
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,710
even if it's within design, you know, if you want to go from being a systems designer to a level

1080
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,193
designer, that same thing could happen. There might be more translation. Maybe you go from a,

1081
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,476
you know, a rank five systems designer to a rank two level designer because you still have some

1082
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:50,539
good design skills that translate over. But pay cuts might happen and you might have to be willing

1083
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:55,223
to accept that if you really want to change careers and start at the bottom. A lot of people,

1084
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:58,726
once they kind of realize that, that's where the dreams of being a multi-class die because they're

1085
00:47:58,726 --> 00:47:59,046
just like...

1086
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:05,528
Nope. I want to be multi-class, but at the same time, I don't want to start over at the

1087
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:09,789
bottom or I don't want to take the pay cut. But some are. Some really find out because

1088
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:12,390
they got a chance to maybe to test it or do a little bit on their own. They explore it

1089
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,932
somewhere. They're like, oh, this is so much fun and I really want to do it. Generally

1090
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:18,853
speaking, I think a lot of people actually move into design because they stumbled into

1091
00:48:18,853 --> 00:48:21,233
it. They did something else. They moved on to it. They discovered it that way.

1092
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:22,974
And sometimes you have designers that move between,

1093
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:25,195
they started out as systems and they moved to other things.

1094
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:28,116
But I once had a level designer that moved into programming

1095
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,197
and now they're a programmer.

1096
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,477
They just moved out of design

1097
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:31,718
because they really like programming more

1098
00:48:31,718 --> 00:48:32,838
and that's the way it happens.

1099
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:35,579
So moving on now, let's talk about what I promised

1100
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,900
was the battlefield promotion.

1101
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,621
So what's the battlefield promotion?

1102
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:41,122
Well, that's when disaster strikes

1103
00:48:41,122 --> 00:48:44,023
and you've lost someone on your team that was important.

1104
00:48:44,023 --> 00:48:47,204
You need to be prepared for that potentially to happen

1105
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,645
and what to do when you react.

1106
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:55,770
Say you have two systems designers and you have a lot of systems and work and then one of them leaves your company right before a key milestone.

1107
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,834
And you need somebody to be able to do some systems design work. Well, it's time for the battlefield promotion.

1108
00:48:59,834 --> 00:49:04,537
You're going to take one of your level designers or content designers and move them over because they showed an interest in it.

1109
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:12,564
Or maybe you're going to take one of your QA guys that has some really good system chops because that's never happened in the gaming industry.

1110
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:16,367
Yeah, where, you know, QA has had to backfill a design position for some reason.

1111
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:16,627
But.

1112
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,168
When that happens, if you do go into that,

1113
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:21,628
have an exit strategy planned.

1114
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:22,929
Make sure that you're thinking about,

1115
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:25,589
okay, we need a systems designer forever

1116
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:26,869
for maybe only six months.

1117
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:27,690
What is it?

1118
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,770
Time box, it sets something up that says like,

1119
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,591
okay, for this milestone or for this,

1120
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:33,131
we need a system, someone to come in,

1121
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,611
do this sort of like data entry

1122
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:36,532
in the system side for six months.

1123
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:38,272
At the end of that,

1124
00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:40,333
we plan to move that person back to their original career.

1125
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:41,653
We're not gonna affect their pay.

1126
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:43,273
It's basically a free chance for them

1127
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,614
to learn some system ropes,

1128
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,434
but then they go back to being a contents designer

1129
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:46,914
or, you know.

1130
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:51,476
and whatnot. And so you need to be honest about careers prospects, because if you're doing this

1131
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:55,057
with someone that really wants it, like they really want to be a systems that are they really

1132
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:58,258
want to be a level designer, you're giving them a shot at it, they're going to want to stay at it

1133
00:49:58,258 --> 00:50:04,260
afterwards. So be realistic, it's like, hey, you know, we lost our rank six systems designer,

1134
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,141
he's gone, we're going to bring someone in to do some of the data work. But the reality is,

1135
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:12,363
we're going to continue to try to hire someone to backfill that who is at least a rank five,

1136
00:50:12,363 --> 00:50:15,964
rank five, six or seven is what we're going to be shooting for, we think it'll take six to nine

1137
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:16,204
months.

1138
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:19,807
we're happy to give you the opportunity to work as a systems designer for say six months,

1139
00:50:19,807 --> 00:50:23,870
maybe up to nine months if things go well. But the reality is we are going to look to backfill

1140
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,453
this position as quickly as possible and bring someone in to do that work. At the end of that,

1141
00:50:28,453 --> 00:50:32,316
we want to ensure that you'll still have your job in your original field. So be honest with that,

1142
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:32,856
career leaders.

1143
00:50:33,157 --> 00:50:36,017
And people who are trying to go in that who might get a battlefield promotion,

1144
00:50:36,017 --> 00:50:39,759
if they didn't talk to you about a next strategy, you know, talk to them about it.

1145
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,339
Is it really a permanent change or is it a temporary change?

1146
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,420
Because they're really going to look back.

1147
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,240
That's not wrong.

1148
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,281
You know, just bring it out in the open, shed light on that

1149
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:48,701
and and get all that stuff out at the beginning.

1150
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:50,462
So that way, you know, is that cool?

1151
00:50:50,462 --> 00:50:52,702
I'm getting a chance to work as a system designer for six months

1152
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:54,863
or a level designer for two months, whatever the case may be.

1153
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:56,363
That's great. I'll take that opportunity.

1154
00:50:57,564 --> 00:51:01,186
So let's summarize a little bit and go through some of these and discuss some takeaways as we

1155
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:05,988
wrap this thing up. So act one, we talked about designer criteria and to just kind of go back to

1156
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:09,509
these are some of the individual skills and every studio I recommend if you don't have a

1157
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:14,111
quantification of your designer criteria and you're not quantifying skills like items, item assignments

1158
00:51:14,111 --> 00:51:18,233
and the various progression, you don't have to use the literacy competency mastery system that

1159
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:21,254
was described. You could just do a you know a one through five or whatever the case may be.

1160
00:51:21,614 --> 00:51:26,075
But try to give your designers, you know, individual skills and I see those, I see contribution skills

1161
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:29,596
and progress up through it and give them clear targets as they move up the bands within your

1162
00:51:29,596 --> 00:51:33,997
company. And then once they've gotten to a point where they get to the gap, where, you know,

1163
00:51:33,997 --> 00:51:37,698
they're starting to get to want to be seniors, they want to be able to own features and content,

1164
00:51:37,698 --> 00:51:41,359
they want to be a force multiplier. This is where you have to start separating out sort of like the

1165
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,901
seniors from the non-seniors. Remember that seniors have to develop those, those five new key skills.

1166
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:48,982
They have to be able to contribute those because those are new skills that are very important.

1167
00:51:49,525 --> 00:51:50,706
And then you have to separate out,

1168
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:52,146
is this person going to be a lead?

1169
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:54,987
Or are they not really a people leader?

1170
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:58,048
And maybe they want to be a feature lead or a subdivision

1171
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,688
lead because they want that agency.

1172
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:02,049
But let's make sure we don't put that burden too high.

1173
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:03,829
Harken back to the burden examples.

1174
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,650
My kind of rough rule is that if someone's not a great people

1175
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,811
leader, try to keep the majority of their work

1176
00:52:09,811 --> 00:52:11,131
still focused on their area.

1177
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:13,331
So don't put a burden on them greater than like 40% or so.

1178
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,292
Try to keep it a little bit less than that.

1179
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:16,192
And they'll probably still be happy

1180
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:17,873
if they're spending most of their time doing the thing

1181
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:18,513
that they still love.

1182
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:21,415
And then, act three, growing force multipliers.

1183
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:23,375
We've talked about those five different things

1184
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,016
and kind of why they are valuable to the team

1185
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,196
and a couple of different ways of doing it.

1186
00:52:26,196 --> 00:52:27,576
Some of it will require a little bit more research,

1187
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:29,417
but a lot of them are specific to your project.

1188
00:52:29,417 --> 00:52:31,797
And a lot of it comes down to finding opportunities

1189
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:34,918
for your designers to take risks and grow from mistakes

1190
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,559
and not blow up the project

1191
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,319
or doom it to financial failure in the process.

1192
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,942
So takeaways here, let's talk about for senior skills,

1193
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:46,265
let's one more time and then we'll talk about what we hope leads are taking away from this,

1194
00:52:46,265 --> 00:52:48,647
and then hopefully what designers are taking away from this session.

1195
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:53,111
So we've got ownership and process, mentorship and management, vision and architecture.

1196
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:58,055
We've got technical design, infrastructure, and we've got multi-class, that versatility skills.

1197
00:52:58,055 --> 00:53:00,477
So now let's go in and let's talk about the leaders here.

1198
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:05,319
leaders. Now, let's discuss ways that you can test skills with your designers. And the best way of

1199
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:09,580
doing that is to sit down and talk with your designers about the aforementioned skills.

1200
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,962
However, those are expressed within your structure. You may have slightly different

1201
00:53:12,962 --> 00:53:16,563
names for them for those roles. You know, there's some overlap in those. You can pick them out,

1202
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:17,863
but talk about it with them.

1203
00:53:18,124 --> 00:53:22,827
and find opportunities for your prospective seniors or even sometimes your current seniors

1204
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:27,530
to test those out. You need to create opportunities wherever you can and there are ways of doing that

1205
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:32,353
so make sure again you look for ones that won't kill the project they feel, don't put big risks

1206
00:53:32,353 --> 00:53:36,997
on people that you know haven't don't have proven batting average yet and you know allow for an exit

1207
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:40,319
strategy if you're gonna be like cool we will spend a week trying this thing and if that doesn't

1208
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,982
work out we have a backup plan b that we know is or are highly confident will work.

1209
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:51,076
And then support with resources, resist the temptation to try to, you know, say, hey, you know,

1210
00:53:51,076 --> 00:53:55,380
we don't have any programmers right now. And I know you really wanted a programmer to do this,

1211
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,884
but we don't have it. So maybe you can just do it on your own without a programmer.

1212
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:01,865
Don't, you're putting them in a weird spot.

1213
00:54:01,865 --> 00:54:03,006
You're setting them up to fail.

1214
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,366
Don't set people up to fail.

1215
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,247
If something really needs a resource,

1216
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,787
give them that resource.

1217
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:11,008
So, and then quantify what you want for results.

1218
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:12,869
Like say like, hey, we think this will be successful

1219
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:13,849
if we accomplish this.

1220
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:16,210
If you can't do it non-binary, don't do pass fail,

1221
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,770
be against like, okay, you know, this is like,

1222
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,491
this is an average result.

1223
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:20,491
This is a good result.

1224
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,671
And this is the ideal result.

1225
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:23,072
Let's try to at least get a good result

1226
00:54:23,072 --> 00:54:23,792
and see what we can do

1227
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:26,793
and try not to just fail out right and get nothing out of it.

1228
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:26,953
So.

1229
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:31,058
And here are some quick ideas for things that you might have within your game that you may not even

1230
00:54:31,058 --> 00:54:35,700
realize are things that you could be using as training examples. Small features, any kind of

1231
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,782
little optional content. If you're working on a game that has 20 hours of content, odds are there's

1232
00:54:39,782 --> 00:54:43,944
some optional content in there that you can use to help grow your people and use as a chance.

1233
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:47,686
If you're working on DLC, that's an opportunity there too to take a few little risks.

1234
00:54:47,686 --> 00:54:51,087
And if you're working on things like in live games, events.

1235
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:53,189
Events and live games are fantastic ways

1236
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,531
to give people chances to grow these skills.

1237
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:58,472
Take a chance, allow them to develop that vision.

1238
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:00,454
Once again, those skills that really only grow

1239
00:55:00,454 --> 00:55:02,255
through practice, vision being one of them,

1240
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:04,116
that's a great opportunity to grow that vision skill

1241
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:05,617
when you have those kinds of events.

1242
00:55:05,617 --> 00:55:06,998
And maybe it'll turn into something even greater.

1243
00:55:06,998 --> 00:55:08,680
Maybe it'll turn into a mode that people in your game

1244
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,740
want to play all the time.

1245
00:55:10,365 --> 00:55:14,769
So look out for those opportunities. Don't let them go to waste. And again, resist the temptation

1246
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:18,832
to make your people leaders be the ones that always do that kind of stuff.

1247
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:21,794
Give chances to seniors and prospective seniors.

1248
00:55:21,794 --> 00:55:21,935
So

1249
00:55:22,718 --> 00:55:28,761
If your designers fail, if they fail, because it will happen, do not punish the failure unless it

1250
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:32,863
is due to gross negligence on the part of the designer. There's rare cases, but for the most

1251
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:37,105
part, don't punish them. They're probably feeling bad already. What's important now is to focus on

1252
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:40,627
what you learned. What is the retrospective or post-mortem? And you may want to do this even

1253
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:43,869
if they succeed because it's important to understand why they succeed. If they're just like,

1254
00:55:44,149 --> 00:55:46,472
I succeeded because I was very cool.

1255
00:55:46,472 --> 00:55:50,357
That's a problem there because they don't really understand why they succeeded.

1256
00:55:50,357 --> 00:55:52,239
They probably won't be able to repeat that success.

1257
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,204
So do prospectus and postmortems probably even if they succeed and if you get the impression

1258
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:58,167
that maybe they didn't quite grasp why they succeeded there.

1259
00:55:58,167 --> 00:55:58,207
So

1260
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,988
Transcribed by https://otter.ai

1261
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:00,829
Let the whole team learn from it.

1262
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:02,309
You know, target those prospects and post-pros

1263
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:04,050
on either larger subsets of designers,

1264
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:05,791
perhaps everybody, you know, artist programs,

1265
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,552
the people who are related to it when it goes down.

1266
00:56:07,552 --> 00:56:08,652
And again, it's not to punish.

1267
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:10,053
You're not trying to humiliate designer,

1268
00:56:10,053 --> 00:56:11,034
be like, this is how he feels.

1269
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,454
Like, hey, this is the stuff we tried

1270
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:13,455
and this is what didn't work out,

1271
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:15,516
but this is what we learned, aha.

1272
00:56:15,516 --> 00:56:18,377
And expect and actually do better next time.

1273
00:56:18,477 --> 00:56:22,198
you know, the point of doing these sorts of prototypes, if you give someone a chance and

1274
00:56:22,198 --> 00:56:24,859
it doesn't result in something valuable for the project, they were supposed to have gained

1275
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:27,959
experience from it. And that experience is supposed to make them better and being able

1276
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:31,660
to do it better next time and not repeating mistakes. Don't, if they repeat mistakes,

1277
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,981
then you're having problems. And that's what we'll go into when we'll talk. This is the takeaways

1278
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:38,382
focused on designers here listening to this session. If you're a designer trying to make

1279
00:56:38,382 --> 00:56:40,202
a career out of not being a people leader,

1280
00:56:40,642 --> 00:56:42,623
Find outlets to practice and demonstrate

1281
00:56:42,623 --> 00:56:43,583
the senior plus skills,

1282
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:45,424
the ones that let you become a force multiplier,

1283
00:56:45,424 --> 00:56:47,404
the vision, the ownership, the infrastructure,

1284
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,805
everything we've talked about here.

1285
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:49,565
You need to find outlets

1286
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,945
and you need to work on those with your leads,

1287
00:56:51,945 --> 00:56:53,466
but don't expect an instant promotion

1288
00:56:53,466 --> 00:56:54,466
if you pull off one of those.

1289
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:55,927
It's just like, cool, guess what?

1290
00:56:55,927 --> 00:56:57,607
This feature that we did a thing for,

1291
00:56:57,607 --> 00:56:58,767
I was trying to demonstrate a vision,

1292
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:00,888
I demonstrated vision, now promote me to senior.

1293
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:01,648
No, no, no, no.

1294
00:57:01,648 --> 00:57:02,709
It's about the batting average.

1295
00:57:02,709 --> 00:57:04,649
It's about that consistent routine.

1296
00:57:04,649 --> 00:57:06,170
You're gonna need a couple of examples

1297
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,250
and you're gonna wanna talk about

1298
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,790
how you did to those examples and what you learned.

1299
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,574
And you might actually have three examples where you all failed, but you learned a ton of stuff.

1300
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:14,115
And maybe the team actually got better.

1301
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:17,438
And maybe the next project is going to be even smoother to do because you're like,

1302
00:57:17,438 --> 00:57:19,139
hey, we failed on this, but we learned these things.

1303
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:20,260
We know not to do these things now.

1304
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,001
We know not to do that.

1305
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:24,784
So you could, again, that's why it's better to quantify things not as a binary pass fail,

1306
00:57:24,784 --> 00:57:28,307
but as a what did you learn and did you have good results out of it?

1307
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:31,508
So, moving on then, remember that these are new skills too.

1308
00:57:31,508 --> 00:57:35,410
As you get to that, as you get to the gap and the inflection point,

1309
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:39,651
you are going to go from being a master at certain things that you are getting good at.

1310
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:44,773
Again, using the items example, you're really good at making awesome swords and the players love your swords,

1311
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:47,434
but you're hitting that diminishing returns curve.

1312
00:57:47,434 --> 00:57:52,977
You know, making better swords really isn't helping the team or the project or the company grow that much more.

1313
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:57,161
You gotta start developing new skills that focus more on being a force multiplier.

1314
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:01,006
Multiply the team, multiply the project, multiply the company, do what you can.

1315
00:58:01,006 --> 00:58:04,830
That's why those ownership and vision, all those other skills are focused on exactly that.

1316
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,811
You're going to have to learn them.

1317
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:06,932
You're not going to be good at them.

1318
00:58:06,932 --> 00:58:09,035
You've just become a master at something.

1319
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:10,917
Now you got to go back to being a noob again.

1320
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:12,078
It's frustrating.

1321
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:14,201
Don't get burned out by it and keep practicing at it.

1322
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:19,715
Learn from failure. Keep trying. Don't repeat mistakes. That is the number one thing that'll

1323
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:24,319
get you shut down and you'll lose the trust and agency that you're hoping to earn is if

1324
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:29,304
you repeat mistakes. If you're constantly making new mistakes, that can be good, but try to make

1325
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:33,528
big books and mistakes. Make mistakes related together, get them all out of the way and then

1326
00:58:33,528 --> 00:58:36,651
move on to the next one. And eventually you'll stop making mistakes and be super awesome.

1327
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:39,154
We'll talk a little bit here quickly about one-on-ones.

1328
00:58:39,154 --> 00:58:40,916
And one-on-ones, if you're not familiar with the term,

1329
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,518
is usually a conversation that's had

1330
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:46,043
between a subordinate and their supervisor.

1331
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:47,705
So like a systems designer has a one-on-one

1332
00:58:47,705 --> 00:58:49,828
with the lead systems designer,

1333
00:58:49,828 --> 00:58:51,971
or a contestant might have a one-on-one

1334
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:53,373
with the design lead of the project,

1335
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:54,895
or maybe, and also the lead contestant.

1336
00:58:55,195 --> 00:59:00,402
But during these, use them as an opportunity to discuss your skills, both your designer sort of

1337
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:03,747
individual skills, like again, if you're a guy who makes items rewards, talk about how good you are

1338
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:07,371
at making items a little bit, and if there's ways you can still improve. But then as you get close

1339
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:10,456
to later levels, you're going to want to talk about those senior skills. Let's talk a little

1340
00:59:10,456 --> 00:59:13,580
bit if you're under four years, though, you're mostly going to want to focus on ISC skills.

1341
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,161
You got to get good. You're still learning to become that master. You got to develop those things. So focus on that. Talk about them.

1342
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:24,402
You know, talk about the things that you're that you need to learn. You want to do to get better at that to become a really good staff person.

1343
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:29,703
And then as you kind of get those experience, you know, you might get a few things thrown your way where you get to work on process.

1344
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:33,704
You know, you get to do some stuff with vision. You get to maybe do a little bit of infrastructure.

1345
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:41,166
Maybe you can get exposed to some multiclassing. And great. Take that. It's like, you know, cheating and reading ahead in your your school textbooks or reading ahead in the chapter a little bit.

1346
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:43,527
But, you know, don't worry about it too much. Focus on the current chapter.

1347
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:47,169
right now. Then when you start getting like the four to six year range, that's

1348
00:59:47,169 --> 00:59:49,710
when you're going to focus on those senior plus skills. That's when you're

1349
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,291
going to start developing and needing to ask for opportunities. And you're

1350
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:55,513
probably going to ask for opportunities for the rest of your career. This is why

1351
00:59:55,513 --> 00:59:58,295
it's sort of a long-term. This is how you grow from being a senior into a

1352
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:01,176
principal and at some point maybe an expert. Again, experts didn't get to be

1353
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:04,938
experts because they played it safe, but they also didn't get to be experts

1354
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:09,301
because they probably blindly, luckily stumbled into it. They

1355
01:00:09,301 --> 01:00:11,202
developed a series of progressive

1356
01:00:12,182 --> 01:00:16,404
prototypes, they enhance their vision, they've probably failed at a lot of things, you know,

1357
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:19,746
but they were efficient, they managed their time well, and they managed to grow into great

1358
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:24,428
design as a result. So, wrapping things up here, we're just about out of time now. I want to go in,

1359
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:25,949
I want to do a few special thanks here.

1360
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:28,310
I interviewed a lot of people and talked to a lot of people

1361
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,830
about the companies and it's not just Cryptic Studios

1362
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,611
that I have to thank for helping me do this presentation,

1363
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:35,071
but a lot of other designers at other companies.

1364
01:00:35,071 --> 01:00:36,912
And so I'll saw Rye Floss and the key people.

1365
01:00:36,912 --> 01:00:39,253
We've got Al, we've got Thomas, we've got Randy,

1366
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:41,133
we've got Mark, we've got Drew,

1367
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:44,214
we've got Steve, Adam and Steven.

1368
01:00:44,214 --> 01:00:46,515
And all the designers I've worked with over the past 20 years

1369
01:00:46,595 --> 01:00:49,577
years, in particular, those people, because they sat down and willing to spend

1370
01:00:49,577 --> 01:00:52,780
dedicated time interviewing me and talking about their careers and the careers of

1371
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,663
people around them. But all the designers I've worked with over the past 20 years,

1372
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:58,005
it's been great. I appreciate all of you.

1373
01:00:58,005 --> 01:01:00,247
I hope you forgive me for the mistakes that I made,

1374
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:02,870
especially since I kind of skewed towards that people leader track.

1375
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,093
And I always have been a great manager supervisor, but it's been a blast.

1376
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:08,875
And I hope that you all are having awesome careers and hope that you all stick

1377
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:11,518
around and develop those long-term design careers,

1378
01:01:11,518 --> 01:01:13,079
even if you're not going to wind up being a lead.

1379
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:19,101
And lastly, but not least, I want to say special thanks to you for sitting through this presentation.

1380
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:19,781
It's been fun to do.

1381
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:21,263
I've always wanted to do a GDC.

1382
01:01:21,263 --> 01:01:22,765
This is actually a presentation.

1383
01:01:22,765 --> 01:01:24,246
This is actually my first session.

1384
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:29,051
So if you liked it, please like and subscribe to my GDC channel, I guess.

1385
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:34,275
So that's it. This is the end of force multipliers, long-term design careers for non-leads.

1386
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:39,138
I'm Brett Norton. If you want to contact me, my work and personal emails are there.

1387
01:01:39,138 --> 01:01:41,419
Feel free to ask questions. I'm more than willing to engage.

1388
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:44,822
If you think Cryptic Studios is awesome because I get this, great.

1389
01:01:44,822 --> 01:01:46,303
Come talk to me and I can give you some more info.

1390
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:49,585
But again, if you have any follow-ups you want to do, let me know.

1391
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:51,386
Otherwise, thank you once again for coming.

1392
01:01:51,386 --> 01:01:54,248
I appreciate it and have a good GDC.

1393
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:56,009
I hope to see you in person next year.

1394
01:01:59,412 --> 01:01:59,694
You
