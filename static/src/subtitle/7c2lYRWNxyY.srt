1
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:07,745
and welcome to our talk about our game subscription

2
00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:08,425
on Patreon.

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:10,267
We're a sockpop collective.

4
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:13,749
We're a video game collective slash game dev boy band.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,592
We are four game makers based in Utrecht in the Netherlands.

6
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:19,834
And pictured from left to right, we're

7
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:22,936
Ruben, who's sitting over there, Diamond, who's standing next

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,298
to me, me, who's standing over here,

9
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:29,020
and Tom, who's sitting over there.

10
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:30,762
We make a lot of small games.

11
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:34,625
In fact, last year, we released 26 games in total.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,584
We release these as part of our subscription service on Patreon.

13
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:45,151
What that means is that people can subscribe to get a new game made by us every two weeks.

14
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:50,257
We started this Patreon to make money with releasing cool small games so that we can

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,700
become sustainable in the long run.

16
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,237
In this talk, we'll explain how we got started,

17
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:01,219
how we managed to release a new game every two weeks,

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,102
how we combine it with working on other projects,

19
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,723
and how our Patreon grew.

20
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,866
To quickly give you an idea what the 26 games are like,

21
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:11,128
we'll show them to you quickly in this video.

22
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,192
Okay, gotta snipe to start, though.

23
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:17,654
Okay, there we go.

24
00:01:19,435 --> 00:01:19,936
Suck butt.

25
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:49,513
We gotta go a little bit fast because there's less minutes in this log than the games we made last year.

26
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:50,873
Oh, oh no.

27
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:52,474
Alright, next.

28
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:55,715
Alright, so now for some Patreon background.

29
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,713
So for the Patreon, you get one game every two weeks

30
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,274
for $3 a month.

31
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,236
However, the games are also available

32
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:25,298
on our favorite website, itch.io, for $3 each as well.

33
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,400
The Patreon roughly works similar

34
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,762
to a magazine subscription, where if you subscribe,

35
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:36,943
you only get the new games and the current games,

36
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,925
so you wouldn't get our entire backlog.

37
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:41,913
of 30 games.

38
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:50,803
Most of the games are designed to be finished within a single play through, taking roughly

39
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:53,065
about 50 minutes to one hour to complete.

40
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:59,212
Right now we have about a thousand patrons, totaling for almost $4,000 a month.

41
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,017
However, this is not our only source of income.

42
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:08,778
We also do some freelance work and some commission work,

43
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:12,699
as well as releasing some bigger games that are not

44
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:13,639
released for the Patreon.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,721
We spend about half our time on the Patreon.

46
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,142
Right, so this should provide some context around the Patreon.

47
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:28,343
And now we'll discuss how Sockpop was formed.

48
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:29,023
Yeah.

49
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:35,841
Yeah, so we met each other roughly around 2014 as young game jammers through mutual

50
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,722
friends and Twitter.

51
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:42,228
And we often would do game jams at each other's places, especially the Lunumdari one.

52
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:45,932
And that's basically how we got to really know each other, like the four of us.

53
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:53,435
And at the end of 2015, we wanted to take things more seriously and spend more time making games, basically go pro, right?

54
00:03:53,936 --> 00:04:04,901
So, there was one big obstacle in the way, which was that we saw that it was getting increasingly harder for game makers and games to stand out from the crowd, as a lot of you must be familiar with.

55
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:10,262
So we decided to band together under the Sockpop name as a collective.

56
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:11,963
So not like a traditional studio.

57
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:16,204
What we would do, we would basically function without being two hands involved

58
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:20,586
with each other's games, and we'd use our combined forces to be more visible.

59
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,387
And yeah, like that we basically started making a bunch of small, mostly jam games

60
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:28,188
and releasing them under the Sockpop name.

61
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,763
Yeah, and by making all these small games and posting GIFs of it on Twitter,

62
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,225
we quickly gained a following on there.

63
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:39,547
Tweets like this one.

64
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,091
And this one.

65
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,555
And Twitter became very important for us.

66
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:53,160
For a long time, it was basically our main way to communicate and be visible

67
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,981
to the people that liked our work.

68
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:00,411
And over time, we actually started influencing each other as well

69
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:04,093
and developed a similar style, I think,

70
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:07,414
with lots of procedural animations,

71
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:11,796
cute physics,

72
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,058
and funny interactions.

73
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:24,175
So yeah, after doing this sock pop thing quite casually

74
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:27,397
for a couple of years, mostly just running a Twitter account

75
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:29,939
and sometimes doing showcases,

76
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,760
we were getting to a critical point.

77
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:34,462
We needed money.

78
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:38,024
Maybe some of you recognize this problem.

79
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,887
So in order to cope with this problem,

80
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:43,428
we noticed we had two things.

81
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:47,290
We had a dedicated, albeit a small, following.

82
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:50,938
And we were good at making small games fast.

83
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,521
But we had no real idea how to turn that

84
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,322
into cold, hard cash.

85
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,045
Yeah, so we tried to figure out

86
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,346
what maybe could work for us.

87
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,228
The first thing we thought about was maybe turning

88
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,369
our small projects into game dev tutorials,

89
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:09,291
because that's something a lot of people asked us.

90
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,633
But yeah, we really quickly found out

91
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:13,334
we don't really want to make tutorials,

92
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:14,034
we want to make games.

93
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,415
So we decided not to try this.

94
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:20,437
Then another idea was to make remixed versions of existing games.

95
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,320
So we would basically make them sockpup versions,

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,142
but nobody really wanted to give us their source code,

97
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,583
so that didn't really work out.

98
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:29,865
Yeah, it's too bad.

99
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:33,247
Then we decided maybe we can try making an album,

100
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:37,290
like a music album, but instead of sound and music,

101
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:39,212
there is small games instead.

102
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:40,533
And we actually tried that.

103
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:45,694
We released Bamboo Ippie, which is a collection of small bamboo-themed games.

104
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:48,455
And it really didn't work out too well.

105
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,716
It didn't really sell enough to try something like that.

106
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:55,998
That was our first time really experimenting with selling a commercial game.

107
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:56,578
Yeah.

108
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:02,060
Well, and then someone said to us, well, you're making all these games.

109
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:04,562
Why don't you just sell them?

110
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:12,641
And while we thought the games were a bit too small and generally they were unfinished as well,

111
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:18,424
to even consider selling them, I guess we could see how we could just finish up some rough edges

112
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:23,727
and maybe try to release them some way or another. And then we found out about Patreon.

113
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:30,971
So, for those of you who don't know what Patreon is, it's a platform where you can support artists

114
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:32,251
on a monthly basis.

115
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:40,266
And when we saw this, we realized that we could use this to create a subscription model

116
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:45,211
by simply giving those supporters games as a monthly thank you gift.

117
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:49,235
So we decided, let's try out this Patreon thing.

118
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:50,056
Yeah, let's just do it.

119
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:53,852
And at this point we thought, let's just set up a page really quickly,

120
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:54,952
and you know, get started.

121
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:59,533
But we kind of underestimated all the work that goes into setting it all up.

122
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,414
In the end, it took us about half a year of part-time work.

123
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,835
And here's a short list of things that we needed to do.

124
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:10,036
We needed to set up an entire subscription page.

125
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,837
This has nothing in it, so that was still pretty easy.

126
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,597
Then we needed to make a nice banner,

127
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:17,138
a cool introduction video.

128
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,997
A cool piece of introduction text.

129
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:24,338
Goals for us all to achieve together,

130
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,439
those are in the bottom left.

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,081
And tiers, so you can get the game for $3,

132
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,503
but for example, you can also pay $10

133
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,564
and then you also get the source code,

134
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:36,405
so you can make a remake version of our games.

135
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,806
Yeah.

136
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,187
We added Discord integration,

137
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,448
which became an important tool for us

138
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:42,869
to stay in touch with our community.

139
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,584
And then there was a bunch of different thank you texts,

140
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,645
FAQs, help files.

141
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,626
And finally, we built an integration

142
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,467
between itch.io and Patreon,

143
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,008
so that all the Patreons could actually download

144
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:57,389
the keys they are eligible for.

145
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:57,769
Yeah.

146
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:01,731
So that's a short recap of the stuff that we needed to do.

147
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:04,452
Right.

148
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,553
So another thing we realized is,

149
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,194
in order to make this work,

150
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:13,055
we kinda had to shift our focus from Twitter.

151
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,060
to Patreon.

152
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:19,801
Yeah, and this was a hard decision for us to do because at

153
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:23,142
this point we became somewhat addicted to retweets

154
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:24,443
and getting followers.

155
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:28,684
Yeah, someone mentioned that we were a bit of a gif factory

156
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,425
at this point instead of a game studio.

157
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:31,825
Yeah.

158
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:36,446
Yeah, but in order to really do this, we kind of had to guide

159
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,407
everyone to the Patreon instead.

160
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:41,768
So we did this by becoming sellouts.

161
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,708
and putting links and tweets,

162
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:46,869
and there's a big bubble on our website.

163
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,171
And in more tweets, so when something really blew up,

164
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,312
here's our Patreon.

165
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:51,712
Yeah.

166
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:55,274
Yeah, and then the final thing we did,

167
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:56,595
like the final, final thing,

168
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:58,436
was the only thing we were actually good at,

169
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:00,497
which was make a bunch of games.

170
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:03,598
So we made eight games as a buffer,

171
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,620
in case anything would happen

172
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,401
where we couldn't make a game for the Patreon,

173
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:10,622
we would have these lined up.

174
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:14,336
Yeah, so everything was pretty much lined up.

175
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:18,817
And then the plan was that everyone makes one game

176
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:19,637
every two months.

177
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:22,078
We work on it for around two weeks.

178
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:25,238
So it's like taking a jam game, then polishing that up.

179
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,999
And then we have six weeks left to work on other stuff,

180
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,820
like bigger projects, freelance work, et cetera.

181
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
And it seemed like a great plan, so we decided, let's go.

182
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,880
Good plan.

183
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:40,942
So yeah, we launched on January the 17th with two games.

184
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,401
Bambini, which is a game about bees,

185
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,582
and Yit, a game about trash.

186
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,363
And the launch was quite important for us

187
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,283
because we think it can really set a tone.

188
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:56,564
So yeah, we decided to give everyone these two games

189
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,064
instead of one as a starter bonus

190
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:00,485
and started to look more like a real deal.

191
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:04,526
And based on how other patrons were doing,

192
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:07,907
we expected to reach about $100 by the end of the month.

193
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:13,758
which was exceeded to, yeah, it was $500, which was nice.

194
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,059
Yeah, it was really nice, so we decided,

195
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,759
let's start releasing more games.

196
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:18,600
Yeah, let's do that.

197
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,280
So, Diamond made Dr. Oomgaboom's School of Life.

198
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:24,461
I made New Colony.

199
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:24,901
Yeah.

200
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:28,582
Diamond made another game called King of the Sandcastle,

201
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:30,443
where basically for the first time we found out

202
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:32,703
how fun it is to let our patrons fight each other.

203
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:33,343
Yeah.

204
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:36,304
Then Tom made Muras.

205
00:11:37,893 --> 00:11:39,861
And we even made the app we named Dino Games.

206
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:41,548
Yeah, there are dinosaurs in there.

207
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:41,709
Yeah.

208
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:46,248
All right, so then it was already April,

209
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,549
because time really kind of flies when you release

210
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:49,729
a new game every two weeks.

211
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,471
And we noticed a couple things.

212
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:55,372
The first thing being that we saw that the growth started

213
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,012
plateauing.

214
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,914
We had $500 in the first month, then $650, then $900,

215
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:02,496
and then a little bit less than $900.

216
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:06,197
So the first patrons started leaving.

217
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:08,939
And we were a bit worried that maybe the patron became

218
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:09,439
old news.

219
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,539
And then it also turned out making the games didn't really take two weeks.

220
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,880
It took more like four weeks.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,081
It wasn't just polishing up a jam game.

222
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,742
So things weren't looking too great at this point, but we weren't going to stop.

223
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,003
So yeah, let's make some more games.

224
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,063
Yeah, just make some more games.

225
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:25,723
Right.

226
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:29,925
So Aaron made Driftwood and I made Hoko Poko.

227
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:35,967
And then someone made TomScape, which is an homage to RuneScape.

228
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,725
And then it's May and all of a sudden,

229
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:43,389
there is a Polygon video made by Brian Gilbert,

230
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:44,350
is that person?

231
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:46,973
And the video really blew up for us.

232
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,796
Yeah, what happened is it basically doubled

233
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,398
our patrons and income.

234
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,741
As you can see in this graph,

235
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:56,144
yeah, this is kind of what happened.

236
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:02,591
And we thought that growth halted because our Patreon became old news.

237
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:04,112
Nobody talked about it anymore.

238
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,453
It's a few months in.

239
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:10,337
And but in reality, there were still tons of people that haven't even heard about it

240
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:13,100
and just needed a way to find out about us.

241
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,484
And next to that, we think a lot of people were kind of skeptical.

242
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:19,946
Like, can they keep up with this breakneck schedule?

243
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:22,696
Yeah, we're five months in now.

244
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,416
And I think we kind of proved that this was working.

245
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:29,517
And people started trusting that they would get a new game

246
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:30,037
every two weeks.

247
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:30,537
Yeah.

248
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,898
So that was really cool and very motivating.

249
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,138
So hey, we went back to making games.

250
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:35,378
Yeah.

251
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,739
All right, so Ruben made Kammer.

252
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:39,859
I made Huts.

253
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,940
Diamond made Zoo Packs.

254
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,141
Tom made Botanique.

255
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:49,901
And then Ruben made Spider Pawns.

256
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:53,368
And then I made a game called Llama Villa,

257
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:54,769
which the tagline was,

258
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,870
it's literally The Sims, but with llamas.

259
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:57,970
Yeah.

260
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:01,291
Yeah, you laugh now, but it was kind of annoying

261
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:02,732
because from this point forward,

262
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:06,453
patrons kept asking about everything, but with llamas.

263
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,234
And we said no, and then they took the source code

264
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:11,815
and just replaced sprites with llamas.

265
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,396
Right. So then there was quite an important game for us and it was a game made by Time

266
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:22,661
and called Simulant. It's a card-based God game where you fulfill mankind's wishes,

267
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:25,785
like blessing them with fish or spreading the plague.

268
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:34,985
Simulant, like we said, we also sell the game separately on itch.io and Simulant sold quite

269
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:35,326
a lot.

270
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,027
Here's a graph.

271
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:42,352
The red one is a bad Patreon game and it's still separately on itch.io, so it's about $50.

272
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:44,034
Then green is like $1,000.

273
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,456
That's a good game.

274
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:51,721
And then I guess Simulant Purple makes it 10 really good games.

275
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:57,463
Yeah, so it made about 10k in one month, US dollars,

276
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,324
which is pretty good for a game made in four weeks.

277
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:01,085
So we were really happy.

278
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:04,926
So let's talk a bit about our rules within Sockwap

279
00:15:05,306 --> 00:15:06,347
about splitting our income,

280
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:08,468
because that became very relevant at this point.

281
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:08,828
Yeah.

282
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:11,049
So for the Patreon games,

283
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,190
what we do is we just split the Patreon

284
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,910
and HAL income equally.

285
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,671
So everybody gets 25% after we spend it on office rent.

286
00:15:21,076 --> 00:15:22,356
This is not our office, by the way.

287
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:23,897
Ours has more plans.

288
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,378
And then for non-Patreon games, the rules are different.

289
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:32,099
There, at least 5% goes to Sockbobs.

290
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,500
You can choose not to spend more of your own percentage,

291
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,001
and we use that to spend on events like this,

292
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,163
and submission costs for events, and nice hats and caps.

293
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,903
So yeah, that's our rules regarding splitting income.

294
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:49,684
Let's make some more games.

295
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,224
Let's do it.

296
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,421
Tom made Hoppa.

297
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:57,005
And then Ruben made Soco Loco, which is a train simulator.

298
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,609
And then in September, at this point,

299
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,071
we looked back at some statistics,

300
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:07,815
and we found out that less than 50% of the patrons

301
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,196
were actually downloading the games,

302
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:10,577
which is kind of weird.

303
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:12,519
Yeah.

304
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:17,656
So we were looking up why is this happening.

305
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,318
We found out there are two reasons.

306
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,943
One of them is people were downloading the games in bursts.

307
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,427
So since the games were so short,

308
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,529
what a lot of the people were doing

309
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,312
is just download a few of them

310
00:16:29,412 --> 00:16:30,834
and play all of them in one evening.

311
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:35,396
And the other reason is maybe a bit more interesting.

312
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:38,398
We found out that a lot of them didn't support us

313
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,881
for the games, but also for us and who we are.

314
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:47,043
And I think with the amazing amount of games

315
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,285
that come out nowadays, people start realizing

316
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:53,667
that video games are being made by humans and not robots.

317
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,689
And maybe how people will follow their favorite musicians.

318
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:01,683
they will also start following their favorite game designers.

319
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,444
Found out if they have a nice dog or cat.

320
00:17:06,744 --> 00:17:11,025
So inspired by that, we started making videos with us in it

321
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,166
so people could get to know us a little bit better.

322
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:18,287
And yeah, we talked about why we made the game,

323
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,487
what was our inspiration, yeah, et cetera.

324
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:23,728
Oh, and another thing that happened

325
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:26,108
is we reached our halfway goal, which

326
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:28,449
made us very happy, as you might be able to see.

327
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,417
We did a little live stream.

328
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,993
Yeah, and then came infamous game number 20,

329
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:36,253
the game we don't talk about.

330
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:37,173
It's Oh Crap.

331
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,595
It was more like, oh crap, we have no more games to release.

332
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:45,056
So we ran out the buffer we talked about at the start.

333
00:17:45,076 --> 00:17:46,616
So we had the eight games.

334
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:49,517
But because sometimes we restarted,

335
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:51,638
or sometimes making the games longer,

336
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,879
we basically had no games lying around.

337
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,000
And we had no time to make a new one,

338
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,780
because we were busy with other projects.

339
00:17:59,261 --> 00:17:59,641
So.

340
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:04,071
So this was the first time where we needed to figure out a solution, really.

341
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,694
And we had this old game lying around called O'Crab,

342
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:11,017
which we made together in 2017, and we decided,

343
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,740
well, we basically have to release this because we have nothing else.

344
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,403
And we thought, oh no, the Patreons are going to be really mad,

345
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,965
and it turned out, oh, it's not too bad.

346
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:23,789
They understood that we didn't sleep for eight months, so it was okay.

347
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:29,811
It was actually a really interesting moment, because we realized...

348
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:31,858
Yeah, the next time this would happen.

349
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:34,032
we were screwed.

350
00:18:34,272 --> 00:18:34,952
Yeah, exactly.

351
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,132
Yeah.

352
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:37,833
But we were basically forced to finish

353
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,033
every game we started now,

354
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,073
which put a little bit more pressure on us,

355
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,034
but it's also nice because that would really make sure

356
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:46,474
that we don't spend too much time making these Patreon games.

357
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,495
And we also realized, well, maybe a bad idea

358
00:18:49,555 --> 00:18:50,495
always has something good.

359
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,596
Like if you make a Patreon game and about halfway through,

360
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,596
you're like, I'm not sure what to do with this.

361
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:57,777
And there's always something you can zoom in on

362
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,157
that will make it fun.

363
00:19:01,354 --> 00:19:04,695
And even in the case that people really didn't like one of the games, they would realize,

364
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:09,697
well I paid about $1.50 for this, and yeah, I'll get a brand new different thing in two

365
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,678
weeks, which will probably not be O'Crab.

366
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:12,798
Probably not.

367
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:14,359
Probably not.

368
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,199
And they weren't.

369
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:20,721
This is Fisser, made by Aram, and then I made Döller.

370
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:26,078
Tom made Frog Struggles.

371
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:30,520
And then Aaron made Skidlock, which is a game about cycling.

372
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,501
Very fast, very city. Don't get hit.

373
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,383
And then it's already December and the year's almost gone by.

374
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:39,443
Goes really fast.

375
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:42,311
And at this point, some of the small games

376
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,432
started to become big.

377
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,814
So what we did is a few of the patron games

378
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:50,278
that we and or the people who played it especially liked,

379
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,821
we started developing them into bigger versions

380
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,063
and basically doing full releases of them.

381
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:59,025
And I think this is an interesting workflow

382
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:03,009
since the patron games are actually

383
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,952
minimum viable products, or we call them small versions.

384
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:11,256
And with this, we create some basic income while doing this.

385
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:15,939
And we can test the game design of the game, but also

386
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,961
the commercial viability.

387
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:24,045
So for example, with Similand, I legit thought that the game

388
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,447
sucked, I didn't like it at all.

389
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:29,089
But then the people who played it loved it, and especially

390
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:33,472
YouTubers did, which generated a lot of visibility for it.

391
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:36,114
So I knew that if I would make a bigger version.

392
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:38,969
Yeah, it would definitely do at least something.

393
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,750
So there wasn't a big leap of faith anymore

394
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,051
for me to do this project.

395
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:46,572
Yeah.

396
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,833
And while we were working on bigger versions,

397
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,034
of course we released some more games.

398
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:53,094
So.

399
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:54,354
Newman made Kraken Scourge,

400
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,975
and then the final game of the year I made,

401
00:20:56,995 --> 00:20:58,136
it's called Clutchball.

402
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:03,710
And yeah, that's all. Before you know it, we released 26 games in one year.

403
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,991
Yeah.

404
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:08,214
And I think our biggest accomplishment was not getting burned out.

405
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:15,439
We were really scared this would happen, as releasing a game every two weeks creates a lot of pressure.

406
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:19,941
But we tried to take our rest in the evenings and weekends as much as we could.

407
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:25,944
And we helped each other really out by working in the same space and talking about the games a lot.

408
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:30,266
We have a weekly meeting where we try to be really professional about everything,

409
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:33,347
but it's 9 out of 10 times it's just us chilling in the sun.

410
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:35,448
And I think that's really nice.

411
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:38,249
Like, we really helped each other a lot that way.

412
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,311
And then we also tried to stick to our own rules.

413
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,232
Like the first rule we had was, like,

414
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:44,212
make the game in two weeks.

415
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,993
Well, it turned out that really didn't work.

416
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,514
But once we had the four-weeks rule,

417
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,295
we really kept to that and make sure

418
00:21:50,315 --> 00:21:53,357
that you're not constantly in this sort of high-pressure mode

419
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:53,897
of working.

420
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:57,779
And then you have these four weeks to work a little bit more

421
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,640
chill on your big project.

422
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:03,367
So that was basically that.

423
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,429
Now for some future and some challenges

424
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:08,290
that we're still facing with the Patreon.

425
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:11,793
Yeah, so this is our graph at the moment.

426
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:14,454
So for the last couple of months,

427
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,977
we had a quite steady increase of about $200 a month.

428
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:27,509
But I'm not sure if you can see this, but every time there's this little spike, it starts

429
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:31,793
declining after, and right before that happens, there's another spike.

430
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:36,797
And I tried to draw it, but I don't think you can read it that well.

431
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:41,737
But every time it has a big reason why that spike was there.

432
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:45,841
And every spike has a totally different event to it.

433
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:49,865
So we are not sure if these events will keep popping up

434
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:52,107
or we're basically out of control.

435
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,769
Yeah, a lot of these events always seemed like

436
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,231
they were out of our control and we,

437
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,073
they just popped up out of nowhere.

438
00:22:58,093 --> 00:22:58,813
Yeah, just random.

439
00:23:00,517 --> 00:23:06,045
Yeah, and then we want to reach the purple line, which is $5,000 a month, which will really

440
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:10,832
cover almost all expenses that we have now at the moment.

441
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:17,721
Yeah, and then another thing we do is we release some bigger projects, hopefully.

442
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:23,965
Yeah, so separately from the Patreon, Tom is working on Burnband, I'm working on a bigger

443
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:30,629
version of Skidlocked, and Ruben is working on a bigger version of SocoLoco. And the question is,

444
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:34,611
will these games do well, especially the Patreon games? Because if they do, that would really

445
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:40,474
establish this workflow for us where we have this sort of minimum viable product and then work on

446
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:45,017
it more and then sell that. So I think that would be really cool to see. And then, yeah,

447
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:47,398
I think that's going to be nice.

448
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:53,929
Yeah, at this point, we've already released 32 games.

449
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,432
This is our latest one called Card Kids.

450
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:00,615
Yeah, we hope we've given you some insights about how

451
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:01,536
we've run our Patreon.

452
00:24:02,237 --> 00:24:04,879
And maybe you'll even consider doing your own small game

453
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:05,459
subscription.

454
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,882
I think we'd love to see more people do it.

455
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,204
Yeah, if you have any other questions,

456
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:13,767
feel free to reach out to us on Twitter or via email

457
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:14,648
or in real life.

458
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:16,910
Thank you for your attention.

459
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:19,479
Appreciate it.

460
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,460
Thank you.

461
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:24,004
Thank you.

462
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:26,347
Thank you, Aaron and Taimin.

463
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:27,368
Thank you, Aaron and Taimin.

464
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,031
We actually have time for one or two questions.

465
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,152
There's mics over there.

466
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:32,433
So if you have any questions

467
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:34,956
for Taimin or Aaron right now, you can go up, yeah.

468
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,340
Hi, thanks, guys, great talk.

469
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,251
Do you have any advice for keeping small games like this

470
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:46,592
narrowly scoped and not sort of getting lost?

471
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:49,453
Even if you have a month, I imagine that you could have an

472
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:52,894
opportunity to really dig into mechanics or art or

473
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:53,874
something deeper.

474
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,975
How do you maintain a consistent level of polish

475
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:58,336
without going overboard?

476
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:02,357
So the question was, how do we keep our scopes small so that

477
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,338
the games don't become too big to make in four weeks?

478
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:09,497
Yeah, well, in our case, since we're this collective,

479
00:25:11,197 --> 00:25:13,118
say you were having too big of a scope

480
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:16,739
and we do this weekly meeting outside in the sun,

481
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,219
the other three of us will get angry at you and be like,

482
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,320
no, don't do that.

483
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,480
Yeah.

484
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,961
Yeah, I think that's how we do it.

485
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,181
Kind of how it goes and also.

486
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,404
We try to start with the base first and then just keep adding stuff that would make sense.

487
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:42,189
Yeah, at some point we're like, alright, so you have one week left, try to wrap up at least the full game loop.

488
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:46,732
And then, well, you can always polish some things in the end, in your final week.

489
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:51,634
Hey, I'm Tana, I really enjoyed the talk, it was cool.

490
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,575
One thing I wanted to ask is that you guys mentioned

491
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:55,656
not having burnout, and you also mentioned

492
00:25:55,676 --> 00:25:56,676
your four-week cycles.

493
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:58,877
Is that based on like a 40-hour work week,

494
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:00,818
or do you just kind of work until stuff gets done?

495
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:06,161
Right, so the question was that,

496
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:13,064
if we work a 48-hour work, a 40-hour work week, basically.

497
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,985
Yeah, like pretty much, I'd say most of us

498
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,986
are at the office from.

499
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,654
10 to 6, but not all the time is spent working.

500
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,195
So yeah, I think that's based on that.

501
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,016
Sometimes more, sometimes less.

502
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:26,796
Yeah, thanks.

503
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:33,118
Hi, Averro, it was a great talk, by the way.

504
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:34,019
Oh, sorry.

505
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:35,119
We'll do both.

506
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:38,016
Yes.

507
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:38,736
Cool.

508
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:43,160
I was just wondering, if you guys set that guideline for once

509
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,122
you come up with an idea and you start working on it,

510
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:46,423
you have to finish it, how do you

511
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:48,325
avoid getting stuck on those games

512
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:49,827
and feeling kind of burnt out over them?

513
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:55,482
So how do we avoid getting stuck on the games when you have these guidelines?

514
00:26:55,562 --> 00:26:59,847
I think actually it happens sometimes where with a game you're like after three weeks

515
00:26:59,907 --> 00:27:04,853
of working on it then you're like well I'm kind of done with it but at this point we

516
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:09,519
basically don't have really any other option so we just have to finish it and then...

517
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:16,825
I think a lot of those cases where it happened, then afterwards we were still pretty happy with those games.

518
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:17,245
Yeah.

519
00:27:17,405 --> 00:27:23,390
So like maybe at that point, for example this game, when you said a couple of weeks ago, I was like...

520
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:23,730
This one?

521
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,570
Yeah, this one.

522
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:24,750
Yeah.

523
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:30,334
So I was like, not sure if it's any good, but now I'm like, that's pretty fun, people liked it.

524
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:33,637
Well, I think what we do is we playtest it a lot with friends.

525
00:27:34,337 --> 00:27:38,059
And then you'll notice, alright, so this thing is what they like.

526
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:41,341
This thing is fun, and then the other thing, which I thought was gonna be fun,

527
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:44,643
is stupid. So I'll just kick it out.

528
00:27:46,944 --> 00:27:52,047
The four of you mentioned that all four of your styles kind of converged into the sock pop style.

529
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:56,049
Did each one of you bring something different? Like someone had the animation,

530
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:59,791
someone had the physics, or was it kind of like one person had it?

531
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:09,395
So if our style was like the, the question is if this, our style is the combined forces of us four.

532
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:10,256
Combined efforts.

533
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:20,741
Yeah. I don't know, I think Tom really, Tom has always had super cool colors and that's kind of really inspired me.

534
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:26,885
Yeah, I think we, when you really look at it closely, we all do have our own strengths.

535
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:31,862
But yeah, there are so many things that we've learned from each other.

536
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:39,004
And I think at some point, Ruben and Tom were talking about how you do knees on legs.

537
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:40,324
On procedural animation.

538
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:40,904
Yeah.

539
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:41,584
Yeah.

540
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:43,485
And I did that at the same point as well.

541
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:44,605
We were like, yeah, knees.

542
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:45,586
They're great.

543
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:48,166
Yeah, knees.

544
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:48,546
Thank you.

545
00:28:48,566 --> 00:28:49,807
It's the bees' knees.

546
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:52,288
All right.

547
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:53,008
Last two questions.

548
00:28:54,132 --> 00:29:04,837
Yeah, I'm curious how much of your guys' time is spent on the boilerplate of the game development and the distribution and stuff in the four weeks that you spend on a game.

549
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:13,920
Right. So the question is, how much time do we spend in that four-week cycle on promoting and marketing materials, etc.?

550
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:16,301
Yeah, yeah. And just on some of the...

551
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,665
parts of preparing a game to be launched and stuff,

552
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:20,766
rather than developing the game.

553
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:23,329
Yeah, I think the answer to that is quite simple.

554
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,071
It just takes one full day.

555
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:26,852
Yeah, it's like roughly one full day.

556
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:31,197
Yeah, so the video takes like an afternoon and then.

557
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,316
making a video, doing...

558
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:37,199
There's actually a long list in our Trello board

559
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,700
that explains everything you have to do.

560
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:41,942
Yeah, that's like a full day of work.

561
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:43,904
But it's not very fun to talk about.

562
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:46,445
It's like, oh, make a Mac build, make sure that this setting is...

563
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:49,507
Don't think about it.

564
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:51,668
All right, one more question.

565
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:52,868
Hey.

566
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:57,530
One of the things I love about your guys' games is that you have this style that you have as a group.

567
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:06,234
And I'm curious how much of a reusable code base and tool sets and assets that you use...

568
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:16,518
from game to game. I'm assuming because you have this consistent style now, you probably have some stuff that you can start with and not have to build literally everything from scratch every time.

569
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:19,581
So how much of our assets are shared between different projects?

570
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:23,106
Yeah, and just in general, how much you reuse them from project to project.

571
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:27,930
I think it's less than you would think it would be.

572
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,313
Normally what I do is I think about which game

573
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:34,035
had a certain thing and then try to find the script.

574
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,017
It doesn't really work well.

575
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:37,358
I don't know how you do it.

576
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,941
Yeah, sometimes I share code with Ruben, I think.

577
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:43,063
Yeah.

578
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:46,466
I think it's mostly code because sometimes

579
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,089
Ruben takes ballots from other games, right?

580
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:54,084
Okay, no, no, it's what he said.

581
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,785
But no, it's a lot less than.

582
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:59,646
Yeah, to some degree, yeah, obviously.

583
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:03,127
And then there's a lot of stuff we do over and over again.

584
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:04,308
Yeah, it's mostly about, I think,

585
00:31:04,328 --> 00:31:05,909
the techniques that we reuse,

586
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,750
and then the techniques itself are not that much code,

587
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,471
or it's always a little bit different.

588
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:13,912
But the legs, we always do the legs from scratch,

589
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:16,253
because you get the unique walk cycle.

590
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:16,993
Yeah, exactly.

591
00:31:20,386 --> 00:31:21,932
Right. I think that's it.
