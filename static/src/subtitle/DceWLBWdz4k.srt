1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,181
So thank you for being here.

2
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,543
And so for those who don't know me, my name is Silja,

3
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,164
and I have a PhD in psychology.

4
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,825
And the past 10 years I've worked

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:16,926
in the video game industry.

6
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:19,187
I started at Ubisoft in France, hence the accent.

7
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,769
Then I moved to Ubisoft Montreal.

8
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:23,790
I worked at LucasArts on Star Wars games.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,673
And after LucasArts was bought and closed by Disney,

10
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:30,214
I moved to Epic Games in 2013

11
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:33,836
and worked as director of UX at the studio level.

12
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:37,600
on many projects at Epic, including Unreal Engine,

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,882
and of course, Fortnite.

14
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,784
So this is what I'm going to talk about.

15
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:44,769
When I arrived at Epic, there was no UX, no nothing.

16
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,971
So it was like a UX team of one.

17
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,875
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:53,018
And the idea was to build it up at that time.

19
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,707
So the idea of having a UX mindset,

20
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:59,388
I love to think about UX as a mindset or a philosophy

21
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:01,889
more than a discipline.

22
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,429
Because what's important is just to try

23
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:05,990
to place yourself in your players' shoes

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,130
and build up all the development around it.

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,111
And so to have a UX mindset, you have the people

26
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:14,612
with UX in their titles, especially people

27
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,632
like me coming from.

28
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,096
human factors background or cognitive psychology background.

29
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,779
They're here to bring UX practices.

30
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:24,563
They're here to bring over tools and knowledge

31
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:26,786
about the brain and all that jazz.

32
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,309
And of course you have the people on the core team.

33
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:31,812
They're here to build up the experience

34
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:32,813
that they want to offer.

35
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,575
So designers, artists, engineers.

36
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:38,499
And you have people, so if you have a big team,

37
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,442
you have people on the marketing, publishing side,

38
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:44,525
try to define who the user is, who's your audience,

39
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,607
so you can understand better what they're after,

40
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,530
what they like, stuff like that.

41
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,093
So by understanding your target audience,

42
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:54,534
your users, and the experience

43
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:56,196
that you really want to offer,

44
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:57,957
and by having the right tools,

45
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:59,579
this is how you have a UX mindset.

46
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:03,011
But to get there, it's actually pretty difficult.

47
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:05,452
You know, when in a studio, they are not

48
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:09,494
used to these practices, you have to go step by step.

49
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,375
And the first step that is important

50
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,416
is to try to build trust.

51
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:16,238
Of course, when you enter into a studio,

52
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:21,000
they see coming a girl coming from a kind of psychology,

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,221
like a psychologist.

54
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:25,923
So you have to make sure that they understand that you're not

55
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:29,345
here to impede whatever they're trying to accomplish.

56
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,065
You're here to help them out.

57
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:33,588
And to do that, you need to build trust along the way.

58
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:37,130
And also, you start by debunking some misconceptions.

59
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,611
So I'm not going to talk about that too much.

60
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:44,214
But there are some big misconceptions about UX coming

61
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,115
from the game developers.

62
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:50,257
A lot of them are afraid, which I can understand that UX will

63
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,738
distort the design intentions.

64
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,559
So sometimes when I talk about UX,

65
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,280
I will have a game developer saying,

66
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,841
what about Dark Souls?

67
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,461
I'm like, what about it?

68
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:03,043
Are you gonna, with UX and making it usable,

69
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:06,564
you're gonna have all these games that were super hardcore,

70
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,305
you're gonna change the experience of these games

71
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,126
and make them all easy.

72
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:14,850
Well, no, IQX is all about making sure that the experience you want to offer is the one

73
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,591
that people experience in the end.

74
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:22,756
So if the point of your game is to build a game that is going to be difficult to very

75
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:27,160
specific audiences or hardcore gamers who like to suffer, we're going to absolutely

76
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,141
help you accomplish your statistic goals.

77
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:33,345
And so that's really what's important to remember, that we are here to help you out.

78
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:41,876
So that's the one big thing you need to debunk if you're starting on a team or not used to UX and what it is.

79
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:47,423
Try to really help them out to understand that you're here to serve them and to help them accomplish their goals.

80
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,201
There's another big one is like, yeah, UX is cool,

81
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,822
but we can UX it later.

82
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:57,103
I love how people sometimes use that term as a verb,

83
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,084
as if we can unfuck everything at some point later on.

84
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:02,145
And that doesn't work as well.

85
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,646
And so you have usually like the team,

86
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:07,467
the core team's gonna iterate in a closed loop.

87
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:08,687
And when I see that, I say,

88
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:10,048
oh, you have some prototypes out there.

89
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:10,628
Like, what?

90
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:11,589
That sounds cool.

91
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:12,789
Can we try them out?

92
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,270
Can we bring players over and test it?

93
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,730
And there's a lot of,

94
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:22,756
not fear, but the developers are not super comfortable

95
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:26,399
with that idea and they're like, no, no, no, no,

96
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,562
it's ugly, it's not ready for testing, I don't want to do

97
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:31,064
that, and that's, yeah, happened to you,

98
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,528
that's something that

99
00:04:34,768 --> 00:04:38,429
it's important to understand that it's never too early to test.

100
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,329
You can't test everything early,

101
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,010
but there's always something that you can test,

102
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,570
whether it is the menus,

103
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,671
icons, the systems with dice or whatever.

104
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:49,611
You can always prototype something to test it out.

105
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:52,232
If you test it out when it's very early on,

106
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:55,353
low fidelity, paper,

107
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:58,193
before it's implemented and even better before it's added up,

108
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:01,294
then whatever changes you need to make is actually

109
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:04,455
faster and less costly to do than if you wait.

110
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,377
too long down the line.

111
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,899
So that's really important to understand.

112
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,462
And here's an example of the,

113
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,563
so you can tell that I am not a UX designer,

114
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,905
so this is something that I put together

115
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:21,189
to help the game designers explain

116
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,710
what their vision about the game.

117
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,972
Because it's also important.

118
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:27,112
when you're on a team, it's not always about the UX

119
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:30,033
towards the audience, your gamers, the players in the end,

120
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:33,234
but also when you're working in a studio,

121
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,355
you have to convince your bosses,

122
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:38,115
you have to convince the executives

123
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,796
that your vision is the right one,

124
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:42,117
and this also needs good UX.

125
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:44,857
And so this is the sort of things that,

126
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:47,138
you know, in Fortnite you have your home base,

127
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,379
this is where you grow, just helping them

128
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,239
try to visualize, explain what this is gonna be about,

129
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:52,439
and,

130
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,701
When we were doing the online testing very, very early on,

131
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,963
we had then a version of what the home base was,

132
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,443
what was the point of the home base later on.

133
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:07,725
But it's important to try to have a very low fidelity

134
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,846
version, even if it looks a bit crappy like this one,

135
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:14,207
just at least to make everybody on the same page

136
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,127
and know where we're going.

137
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,185
And so, that building that tailored relationship,

138
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,426
whatever you need right now, I can help you out,

139
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:25,088
I can help explain what you're trying to do,

140
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:28,470
or I can help test something that you need.

141
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,612
At some point during the development of Fortnite,

142
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:35,994
the lead animator was trying to understand

143
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:39,976
what made the husks, the little zombies,

144
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:43,959
more difficult at times to shoot at.

145
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:49,324
And he had like several, the team had several ideas behind it.

146
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:53,828
Maybe the huts were moving too fast, maybe it's an animation problem.

147
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:57,832
Maybe it is because when because these

148
00:06:57,832 --> 00:07:01,015
these enemies are the the least,

149
00:07:01,015 --> 00:07:04,558
the most frail ones, they're also the smallest ones.

150
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,300
So it's.

151
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,343
interesting, but because they are the level one monsters,

152
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:13,345
they're also the ones that are harder to aim at

153
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,087
from a distance because they're small.

154
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:18,109
So maybe it's that, maybe it's something else.

155
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,611
And they wanted to figure out what it was about.

156
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:24,494
So I asked him, can you build a gym level

157
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,756
so we can just spawn the zombies

158
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:31,220
and we can ask players to shoot them as fast as possible

159
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,421
and we can see what's going on

160
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,502
and just reproduce a...

161
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,424
the environment, typical environment in Fortnite,

162
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,625
with some obstacles and the zombies will go around it.

163
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,846
And so this is what we did.

164
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:47,747
He built a gym level and we tested it.

165
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,027
So it looks like this.

166
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,627
The idea was we asked players,

167
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:53,108
we pretended that there was a contest

168
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:56,049
that the ones that were having the best score,

169
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:57,669
we had the prize or whatever.

170
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,790
So we deceived them and then it was like,

171
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,370
they didn't know.

172
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,531
We gave them like a chocolate bar and they were like, okay.

173
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:08,295
But there were good sports with it.

174
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:12,700
But the idea is to think that you're in competition

175
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,022
and they had to do headshots as fast as they could

176
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,744
and as many shots as they could.

177
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:17,424
So it looks like this.

178
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:26,976
There's no sound, but I promise you it's shooting.

179
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:31,418
And so you see they're trying to aim at the zombies.

180
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:31,838
Awesome.

181
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,480
Doing headshots.

182
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,421
And the moments when it's really harder for them

183
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:39,803
is when zombies are going around an obstacle.

184
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:44,354
And so that was really interesting and revealing at that moment.

185
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:51,477
It was not, you know, there's always like several possibilities of why do we have a problem.

186
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:56,299
But we really saw at that moment like going like the pathing code

187
00:08:56,299 --> 00:09:00,381
when a zombie had to go around something was really too sharp.

188
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:03,863
And so this is when it was hard for players to follow that.

189
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:07,725
So that helped us determining what was the greatest problem there.

190
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:17,857
So really trying to be a partner, build trust, and try to find ways to test little things

191
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:24,065
here and there and to help the team communicate what they're trying to offer was really an

192
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:24,906
important step.

193
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,886
Then the second step is to establishing quick wins.

194
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:33,590
You want to show to the core team that a UX process, a UX

195
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,953
mindset is going to help them iterate faster and have quick

196
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:37,353
wins.

197
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:41,877
So to do that.

198
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,423
The important thing is to lay out the main limitations

199
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:48,063
of the brain.

200
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:49,505
And this is usually where I start,

201
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,007
because I want to make sure that everybody understands that we

202
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,788
have brain limitations.

203
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:54,629
Players have them.

204
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:55,730
We have them.

205
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,572
We all in the same boat.

206
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:59,914
And so we need to understand these limitations

207
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:02,637
so we can correct problems when they occur.

208
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:06,961
So this is just a very simplified, overly simplified

209
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,745
diagram of what happens in your brain when you process

210
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,027
information and when you learn.

211
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:15,591
It's always starting from a perception, always starting

212
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:18,153
from an input from your senses.

213
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:20,496
Then you have information processing happening.

214
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,279
And in the end, if you learn about something new, what's

215
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,361
going to happen is it's changing something.

216
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,103
in your brain physically.

217
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:29,346
You have new synaptic connections,

218
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,749
or some synapses are strengthening,

219
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:34,252
so the synapses are connections between neurons.

220
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,676
So physically, it's changing something in your brain.

221
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:38,857
So I'm sure you know all that.

222
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:41,218
But when you learn about something,

223
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,259
it's changing your memory.

224
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,801
And so during this process, there's a lot of factors,

225
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:49,003
of course, physiological factors, biological factors.

226
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:52,345
But the ones that I, the one I would focus on usually

227
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:55,447
is attention, because attentional resources are scarce,

228
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,528
and we know that if you don't pay attention

229
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,890
to what you're doing, you're less likely to remember it.

230
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,571
So attentional resources for our players

231
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,012
is really important.

232
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:06,233
And I usually also talk about emotion and motivation.

233
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:10,056
I'll talk about that a little bit later.

234
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,939
And so, and again, it's overly simplified.

235
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,042
The brain is not this, it's a very complex thing

236
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,583
that we barely understand.

237
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,465
And it's not working in different separate buckets

238
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:22,286
like that.

239
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:26,549
So, it's really, you know, way more complex than that.

240
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:29,031
But it's just to understand the main limitations

241
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,492
that we're facing.

242
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,634
And to give you an example for perception,

243
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,095
I'm going to give you an example from each.

244
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:43,060
and show you one of the limitations and how we can have quick wins once we know that.

245
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,982
So take a look at this image and tell me what do you perceive in this picture?

246
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:49,224
People, okay. What else? Yeah?

247
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,285
Just yell it, it's fine.

248
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:56,828
Street fighter, okay. How many of you see street fighter characters in this picture?

249
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,240
Okay, roughly half the room. Yeah, gamers.

250
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,082
Okay, so it is indeed a representation

251
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,023
of Street Fighter characters

252
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:08,484
by the artist, Ashley Browning.

253
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,885
And this is really interesting because we are at GDC.

254
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,946
We are all game developers.

255
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:14,726
We all love games.

256
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:15,867
We make games.

257
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:16,747
And even then.

258
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,249
Even if we're kind of an homogeneous crowd

259
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:24,111
in terms of what we care about in our gaming culture,

260
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,473
depending on your specific connection

261
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:28,434
with the specific game,

262
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:31,776
you're not gonna perceive this image in the same way.

263
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:34,157
And that's because perception is subjective.

264
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:36,658
And if you're colorblind,

265
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:39,240
like about 8% of the male population,

266
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,541
well, you left out from this example

267
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,423
and you hate me because I'm not allowing you to participate.

268
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:50,575
So it's also a reminder that we're not all perceiving the colors in the same way.

269
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:54,885
And so you have to be careful to never convey information only through colors.

270
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:59,126
So perception is subjective and it's hard for us to remember,

271
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:03,348
especially with vision, because we have such a feeling

272
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,208
that we're perceiving the reality as it is

273
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,229
when perception is in construct of the mind.

274
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:12,470
And so it's very subjective and that's a problem

275
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,411
because in a game, you have a lot of stimuli,

276
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,792
a lot of inputs that your player

277
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,012
is gonna have to interpret.

278
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:22,093
And you want them to perceive all these inputs,

279
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,074
like visual, audio, all these inputs, the way you intended.

280
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:27,136
And because perception is subjective,

281
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:29,939
you're not 100% sure that what you perceive

282
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:33,042
and what you design is what players in the end

283
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:34,243
are gonna perceive.

284
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:37,046
Here's an example from Fortnite.

285
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,248
So that's the reason why we playtest a lot,

286
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:42,611
so that we can verify what players perceive.

287
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:46,675
Can you tell me what you believe this icon

288
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:50,218
from early on from 2013 represents in the game?

289
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,774
Good job, a lot of you play Fortnite.

290
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:57,239
Okay, so that's a good answer.

291
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,983
This was the icon for traps.

292
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:03,410
So of course it's all placeholder in the menu.

293
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,752
You could see the trap icon.

294
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,700
And so we brought over a few players to play the game,

295
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,501
because we had already a good prototype for the core loop.

296
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:16,242
And at the end of the session, players stopped playing.

297
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:19,463
And then I show them a few of the icons or the HUD.

298
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:20,904
And I ask them, what is this?

299
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:21,624
What is that?

300
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:24,645
So I can verify that their perception is matching ours.

301
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:27,106
And for this specific icon, some players

302
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:30,887
actually did not remember or perceived it

303
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,668
as the icon for traps.

304
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:36,940
Some players told me it was the icon for ammunition.

305
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,884
So if you look at the icon right under the trap one,

306
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:41,665
is it right under?

307
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:42,866
It's small for me to see.

308
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:46,529
You see the ammunition icon is pretty close to this one.

309
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:50,469
And so it's a problem, because now I have an icon that's

310
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,350
confusing.

311
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,851
Some players don't recognize it, don't

312
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,312
understand what it's for.

313
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:57,475
And Fortnite is not a game where you want to put the

314
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,376
challenge on player's perception.

315
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:02,179
A game like Monument Valley puts the challenge on player

316
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:04,841
perception, so that's fine when it's the goal of your

317
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:07,863
game, but this is not where the challenge is for Fortnite.

318
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:10,826
So I don't want players to be confused by an icon.

319
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,010
especially the trap icon.

320
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,193
It's one of the main icons in the main menu.

321
00:15:16,193 --> 00:15:19,175
And it's quite core to the experience of Fortnite,

322
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:21,698
like being able to craft traps and place traps

323
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:22,418
is really important.

324
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:26,522
So the UI designer iterated on it

325
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:29,325
and ended up with a stereotypical trap icon.

326
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:31,986
a representation of a trap, a bear trap.

327
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:35,927
There are no bear traps whatsoever in Fortnite,

328
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:37,567
but as soon as we changed this icon,

329
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:40,188
we didn't have any confusion anymore

330
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:41,569
with the players we tested.

331
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:43,909
So even though for you it seems obvious,

332
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:49,411
make sure that you verify that it is indeed obvious

333
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:50,031
for your players.

334
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:58,211
All right, another problem with memory,

335
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:00,214
and I'm sorry I put that very quickly together.

336
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,977
I was supposed to have a little quiz here,

337
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,038
but it's gone.

338
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,560
I don't know what happened.

339
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,306
There's a lot of stuff that when we learn,

340
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:12,308
it's gonna be gone.

341
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:13,830
We're not gonna remember it forever.

342
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,255
So this is what we call the forgetting curve from Ebbinghaus.

343
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:22,498
And the way he did that is he trained himself

344
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:26,281
into remembering some syllables that were non-meaningful,

345
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:31,505
but he could pronounce it in his language, German.

346
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,547
He wanted to make sure that it was non-meaningful,

347
00:16:33,547 --> 00:16:37,991
so it was no familiarity with the content he was learning.

348
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,432
And so he learned a chunk of them

349
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,155
and then varied the moment when he had to recall them.

350
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,693
And when it was immediate recall,

351
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:49,197
so he just learned them all by heart,

352
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:51,499
you know, like for maybe 20,

353
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:54,161
I don't remember how many syllables,

354
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:56,484
right after he learned them by heart,

355
00:16:56,484 --> 00:16:58,385
he has 100% good answer.

356
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,988
After only 19 minutes, it drops down to around 60%.

357
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,450
And after a day, it drops down to 30%.

358
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:03,611
So.

359
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:05,545
That's your worst case scenario.

360
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:10,146
But it means that when you learn something that you

361
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:13,487
don't care about, that is not meaningful with no

362
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:17,029
methodology of any kind, you're very likely to lose

363
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:20,850
about 70% of its content from one day to the next.

364
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,771
Our memory is very fallible.

365
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:26,692
And not only we don't remember everything, and for what we

366
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,053
remember, it's not accurate.

367
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,127
And we also have false memories.

368
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:31,787
It's a mess.

369
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:35,049
We can't really rely on the memories.

370
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,731
And that's a problem, because a game is an experience that we

371
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:43,253
have over several days, weeks, hopefully months and years.

372
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,375
So we want to make sure that from one day to the next,

373
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,956
players are not going to forget about critical

374
00:17:47,956 --> 00:17:51,058
information from them to be successful playing the game.

375
00:17:52,360 --> 00:18:00,165
And a quick win about that is to make sure that we remove some memory load.

376
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:03,186
So if you're not asking players to memorize something,

377
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,467
then there's no problem.

378
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,688
They're not going to forget about it

379
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,809
because they don't have to memorize it in the first place.

380
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:12,532
And so this is the reason why the HUD is very important.

381
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,714
And in Fortnite, every time you go close to a searchable object,

382
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:20,637
you have the pop-up telling you what key you need to press to search that object.

383
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,638
you don't have to remember that information.

384
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,800
We alleviate that load.

385
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,301
Another example is if you're interested

386
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:32,644
in crafting a specific item,

387
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,025
we don't want players to have to remember

388
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,846
all the ingredients for that.

389
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,127
I mean, it's boring information,

390
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:42,110
and we want them to focus on where to find these ingredients,

391
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,391
harvesting them, and then crafting the item.

392
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,252
That's how we do it.

393
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:47,214
what's important in the experience,

394
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,337
not remembering the ingredients.

395
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,563
So we allow for functionality where you pin the ingredients,

396
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:56,487
you pin the recipe in your head.

397
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:57,748
So you do not have to remember that.

398
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:02,736
So it's important to keep that in mind,

399
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:04,878
to remember that we don't remember well.

400
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,240
And also, again, that we're not going

401
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,161
to remember things perfectly.

402
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,244
I usually ask people to try to remember

403
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:16,507
the posture of the thinker from Auguste Rodin.

404
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,149
So you can try that out at home tonight

405
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,671
and look afterwards at the result.

406
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:26,034
It's really hard to remember exactly on which leg or legs,

407
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,616
lay which arm or arms of the thinker

408
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:33,180
because we only have an approximate memory of that.

409
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,605
So memory is fallible and it's a reconstruction of the mind.

410
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,546
So we don't like take pictures

411
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:44,489
and then we can just recover whatever we try to store,

412
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,591
the information we store.

413
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,794
Okay, and last thing I'm gonna talk about, attention.

414
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:54,025
So I'm going to show you cards and ask you to pick a card

415
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,847
and to remember that card.

416
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,969
I'm going to go fast.

417
00:19:57,969 --> 00:19:59,390
All right.

418
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,314
I bet I can now guess which card you picked and make it

419
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:04,095
disappear.

420
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,184
like not impressed at all with my trick.

421
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,966
All right, so I changed all the cards

422
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:14,732
and this is a very basic magician tricks

423
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:16,956
that magicians are doing

424
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:20,080
and it's called misdirection of attention.

425
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,923
In psychology, we call that change minus.

426
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:27,812
It's our inability to see big changes from one scene to the next.

427
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:32,797
And for those who know that these changes are happening, it seems so obvious, but if

428
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:36,981
you don't know that they are happening and you're just focusing on other information,

429
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:42,327
it's likely that you're not even going to realize that something's going on.

430
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,290
And that's because our attention is scarce.

431
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:50,929
We are not good at processing a ton of information.

432
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,909
Attention works like a spotlight.

433
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:55,570
When we focus on something, it's really hard for us

434
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,431
to process other information.

435
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,811
We are terrible at multitasking.

436
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:00,212
It's a myth.

437
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:05,233
And we, again, like the other limitations,

438
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,914
we don't realize that this is what's happening.

439
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:13,155
And so in a video game, we have a lot of different stimuli

440
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,697
that happen at the same time, especially in action games,

441
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,358
which is fine.

442
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,481
We're challenging people's attention.

443
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,584
But when you challenge people's attention during the

444
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:25,027
onboarding, as you're conveying important information

445
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:27,149
for players that they have to remember, well,

446
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,471
then it's dangerous.

447
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:35,393
So here is an iteration that the developers were doing to

448
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:37,513
teach the players how to regen health.

449
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:40,654
So back then, you had to consume a health item.

450
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:44,115
And to try to introduce that to players, initially, it

451
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:45,535
looked like this.

452
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:49,376
So the first time the player's health is going below 50%,

453
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,976
it's blinking.

454
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,597
And then there's information saying, hey, your health is

455
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:57,178
low, you're going to need to consume a health item.

456
00:21:57,178 --> 00:21:58,058
And then it disappears.

457
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:01,207
But at that moment, the player is focused

458
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:02,669
on destroying zombies.

459
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:05,491
So it's very likely that they did not even perceive

460
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,613
that there was something popping in the HUD.

461
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:11,116
So you have to be very careful with that.

462
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:13,037
We're terrible at multitasking.

463
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,419
We are not good at paying attention

464
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,381
to multiple things at the same time.

465
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:20,223
And when players are learning about the mechanics,

466
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:21,925
about your controls and everything,

467
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,946
you have to avoid that.

468
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:27,734
to make sure that players can really process information

469
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:28,994
you want them to remember.

470
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:33,155
So that's what we call the cognitive load theory.

471
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:37,217
Vanessa Emovich this morning talked about it a little bit.

472
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:40,017
But the idea that if there's too much information,

473
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:41,718
we're just not going to process it.

474
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:44,899
And players don't read, so that's another problem.

475
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:47,860
We don't like to read information.

476
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,121
And so this was when we were testing a bunch of PvP modes.

477
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:53,282
Sorry.

478
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:57,444
This was the first iteration.

479
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,505
It's always good to have like three items,

480
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,346
like this is what you need to do.

481
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,487
But then there was a lot of detail and cute artwork.

482
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:07,488
And so players were looking at the artwork,

483
00:23:07,488 --> 00:23:10,890
you see the eye tracking, the red circle,

484
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,710
they were really focused on the artwork

485
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,691
and therefore not reading the instruction.

486
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,712
And so like being in multiplayer,

487
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:17,712
like, ooh, what do I do?

488
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:18,133
I don't know.

489
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:22,157
And so if you make it maybe less beautiful,

490
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:24,821
but more focused on what they need to do,

491
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,224
and reduce the text as much as you can,

492
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:29,467
so then players can bang, bang, bang,

493
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,269
try to understand what they need to do.

494
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:34,493
So that's something that's also a quick win

495
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,155
when you need to change an interface.

496
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:41,748
So we have perception is subjective, attention is

497
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:44,149
scarce, and memory is fallible.

498
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,331
We have a ton of cognitive biases, and so we need to make

499
00:23:48,331 --> 00:23:52,633
the changes and fix things, keeping that in mind so we can

500
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:55,574
understand where it's coming from.

501
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:59,295
The third step is to have common language.

502
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:03,357
Also, it's really important to be able to speak the same

503
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:05,538
language when there are problems so we can address

504
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:06,298
them and try to find a solution.

505
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:12,232
So the language that we established, the usability

506
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:13,353
part, is the same.

507
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:19,445
very established nowadays, about to talk about fun and all that.

508
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:25,310
It's the finding a way to explain how this works is more complicated.

509
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,853
So I'm not going to describe all that because there's ways you can find all that and I'm

510
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:31,615
sure you already know about it.

511
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:36,779
We have heuristics that rule of thumbs to look at usability problems.

512
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:40,622
I just want to highlight here the importance of accessibility, especially since...

513
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:44,304
Keith is not here to talk about it.

514
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:45,926
Please check this website.

515
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:51,189
It's really well done and it's going to give you a lot of tips to have better accessibility.

516
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:53,719
And the second part is engageability,

517
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:57,181
which is mainly how to bring fun and immersion

518
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:58,723
and engagement.

519
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:02,845
And the main elements are, it's motivation,

520
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:05,567
how to motivate players to keep playing.

521
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,710
And then emotion and game flow can support that.

522
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,191
I'm gonna go fast because I can see

523
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:12,412
that the time is running.

524
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:15,514
But human motivation is still complicated.

525
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,116
We don't understand very well how it works.

526
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,458
So this is like a very quick.

527
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,991
mapping of the main type of motivation.

528
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:27,732
There's another talk about it if you want to reference it.

529
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,633
But usually when we talk about motivation,

530
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:33,054
we distinguish between intrinsic motivation

531
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:34,495
and extrinsic motivation.

532
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:37,175
Extrinsic is when you do something

533
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:39,056
to get something else.

534
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,717
Intrinsic is when you do it for the sake of it.

535
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:43,438
So that's really important to try

536
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:46,619
to make sure that your players have what

537
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,000
they need to be motivated intrinsically and extrinsically.

538
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,703
And then whenever, when it's intrinsic, there's a meaning,

539
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:57,444
and when they have to do something intrinsically,

540
00:25:57,444 --> 00:26:00,005
so it's competence, autonomy, relateness,

541
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:02,786
it's also meaningful to what they're trying to accomplish.

542
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,266
And then when you survey your players,

543
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:08,847
you can use that to try to find out,

544
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:11,128
you know, if players get the purpose

545
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:13,248
and the objectives of what they have to do,

546
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:15,269
and if it's meaningful to them.

547
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,770
So this is when you can use Likert scales,

548
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,750
Likert scales like this,

549
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,150
and try to...

550
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:25,522
figure out what's going on and if they understand what they need to do in the game.

551
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:26,423
And later on with analytics.

552
00:26:26,423 --> 00:26:33,469
So that's, you know, the ingredients that we can use, the rules of thumb that help us out,

553
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,591
but it's also establishing a common language.

554
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:36,512
It's really important.

555
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:42,597
That's important, the QA also knows about it, so they can reference back to it from time to time.

556
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,130
And the last step is process.

557
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,554
So establishing a process, especially around UX testing,

558
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,436
make sure that we start with hypotheses.

559
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:55,957
We're not just doing UX test for UX test, that the

560
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:57,899
developers participate in it.

561
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:58,800
We have a plan.

562
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,121
We have goals.

563
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:03,443
We test a build that QA knows what to look for.

564
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:05,545
It doesn't know what we're going to test.

565
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,706
So they're going to ensure there's no bugs for these

566
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,968
particular features or systems.

567
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:11,489
And then in the end,

568
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:13,851
we have task creation.

569
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,072
So there's always takeaways, and we're

570
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:18,254
going to act upon several things.

571
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:21,116
We discuss with the team, of course,

572
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:24,939
to define what we're going to do, what we want to act upon.

573
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:28,521
And that's really important to have that relationship.

574
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:34,165
And at Epic, we have a very great user experience lab.

575
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,367
There's a few Epic people here.

576
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:44,049
So it's pretty cool to see that and to be able to bring people in to do that.

577
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:48,570
I don't think I'm going to have the time to go through the rest.

578
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:56,073
Obviously, I didn't have time to time it because I knew that Keith was not able

579
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:59,354
to do it yesterday night, so I put that all together.

580
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:04,426
The main thing I want to talk about here is whenever you find

581
00:28:04,426 --> 00:28:08,249
a problem, like let's say your players complain that the game

582
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:10,351
is too grindy.

583
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:12,113
Is it a problem from your design?

584
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,034
Is it like the math that's off?

585
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,756
Or maybe it's a problem in perception.

586
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,598
Because remember, perception is subjective.

587
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:20,760
And maybe there's something that is misleading to players

588
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,223
and make them perceive that something is off.

589
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:29,264
So the example I usually take, but I'm not going to have the time to go through it all,

590
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:32,429
is with the weak points in Fortnite.

591
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:35,923
So you have weak points in Fortnite when you start

592
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,605
destroying something.

593
00:28:37,605 --> 00:28:40,647
There's a little pop-up that tells you where to

594
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:42,148
aim to go faster.

595
00:28:42,148 --> 00:28:45,190
And of course, the math and the system design is based off

596
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,531
players using this.

597
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:49,233
And so if players don't know about this and they don't use

598
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:52,135
it, then of course, they're going to feel that the game is

599
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:52,455
grindy.

600
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:55,817
And at the beginning, the players were not seeing this

601
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,498
little thing.

602
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:58,239
They were just ignoring it.

603
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:01,077
And when I was asking what it is, they were like,

604
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:02,458
I don't know.

605
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:07,359
So we iterated on it, and the UI artists

606
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,981
changed it to make it more popping out, standing out.

607
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:16,082
And still the players were not using it.

608
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,482
So we're like, what the hell?

609
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:20,283
And when we were asking them what is this,

610
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:23,684
players were saying, oh, this is where I'm targeting,

611
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:26,005
this is telling me that I'm targeting this element.

612
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:31,065
So in the end, what the designers did is they,

613
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:35,149
in the PVE mode, at some point you're gonna unlock,

614
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,551
you don't have that ability right away,

615
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,973
you unlock it in the skill tree.

616
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:44,436
So now it's an event, now it has meaning,

617
00:29:44,436 --> 00:29:47,078
and now players know there's something new.

618
00:29:47,078 --> 00:29:50,001
And after we did that, we had way more players

619
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,642
that were actually using it.

620
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,683
All right, so I'm going to go through all that.

621
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:55,923
I'm sorry.

622
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:58,925
So, yeah, I know, it's like, ooh, I'm the fly.

623
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,847
So these are the four steps.

624
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:05,209
If you want to build a UX mindset in a company,

625
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:09,352
this is what worked for me in the past.

626
00:30:09,352 --> 00:30:13,876
You start by building trust with the people you're working in

627
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:16,557
so that everybody is sure that you're on the same boat.

628
00:30:17,243 --> 00:30:18,804
you're not gonna backstab them,

629
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:21,866
you're not gonna test the game and then show the VPs

630
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,828
and say, oh, look at what they're not doing.

631
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:25,229
You're working with them

632
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:27,090
and you're helping them solving the problems.

633
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,872
And then you establish quick wins,

634
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:31,853
you have a common language,

635
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,134
and you develop a process.

636
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,695
So that together you can get there.

637
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:39,638
Of course it can take a lot of time.

638
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,947
There's a few maturity models in terms of UX.

639
00:30:42,947 --> 00:30:46,589
This one is simpler.

640
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:49,911
But just to let you know, it can take years

641
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:52,992
to get to the distributed model where we really

642
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:54,133
have a UX strategy.

643
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:59,716
Last thing I want to talk about is for your recruiters

644
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:02,057
to understand a bit better the different UX roles.

645
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:04,719
And sometimes it's a bit confusing,

646
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,339
because what's a UX designer?

647
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:08,060
Is it like UX slash UI?

648
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,601
I'm confused.

649
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:09,801
Are these people making pretty things?

650
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,312
So it's also important to try to establish these different roles and what they mean.

651
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:21,594
And then if you do that, the last step is really having business goals aligned also

652
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:26,416
with the development teams and what they're trying to do and the support team

653
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:32,218
so that everybody can reach these goals and understand the US strategy behind it.

654
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:33,719
All right, that's it.

655
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,980
So thank you so much.

656
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,700
I hope it was not too chaotic.

657
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,964
I don't think we have time for questions

658
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,727
because I talked too much.

659
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:51,410
But I'll take questions, I'm just gonna stay a bit here.

660
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,813
So thank you again and yeah.

661
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,175
Oh, you wanna ask a question?

662
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,737
All right, run, run, run for the mic.

663
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:01,461
That was a great talk.

664
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:01,842
Thank you.

665
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:02,522
Thank you.

666
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:03,423
That's very interesting.

667
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,124
So this is my question.

668
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,126
You brought up hypotheses, and I want to go into that for a second.

669
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,328
Let's say you are a researcher and you have a hypothesis.

670
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:12,889
It's a problem I'm working through.

671
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:19,012
And you play through some content, and you have a different hypothesis than the designer

672
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:19,673
who is biased.

673
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:26,056
You're trying to build trust, but you're also trying to test in a way that can inform the designer

674
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:31,679
that what they see is not the same as what you as a researcher or potentially the player see.

675
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,541
So there's almost like, I want to say, conflict of interest. It's very difficult to...

676
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,582
So how do you do it?

677
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:43,285
Great, thank you. I'm so glad you asked that question.

678
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:46,506
It can be tricky sometimes.

679
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,749
When you build trust, you have also to explain to the people

680
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:53,591
you're working with that they have to trust you as a

681
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:57,735
researcher, and that you're trained to establish what the

682
00:32:57,735 --> 00:33:00,417
protocol, the experimental protocol, is going to be able

683
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:02,198
to test what they're trying to test.

684
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:04,060
And this is usually what I do.

685
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,362
I'm telling them, bring me your questions.

686
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:11,167
give me your hypothesis, and then I'm

687
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,389
going to build up the experiment that

688
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:15,111
is going to be able to test this hypothesis.

689
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:19,515
And when we go back and forth and see if we aligned.

690
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,477
But trust has to go both ways.

691
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:22,638
You have to do the first step.

692
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,421
But then you have to make them understand, hey,

693
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,263
I'm trying to do that.

694
00:33:28,263 --> 00:33:28,563
So trust me.

695
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:29,884
Does that make sense?

696
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:33,532
She's like, yeah.

697
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:35,415
I was gonna say, sometimes they question

698
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,638
how you build the experiment or how you run the experiment,

699
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:38,860
and that's another issue altogether,

700
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,363
which I don't know if you wanna get into.

701
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,725
Yeah.

702
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:45,250
Yeah, I mean, it's never always super easy.

703
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:50,858
You can just show them how it works a little bit,

704
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:54,319
or concentrate on the other people who trust you

705
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,059
and start with them,

706
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:59,100
because then you can establish the quick wins

707
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,460
and then it's gonna be easier to convince the others.

708
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,941
So if you have that level of resistance,

709
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,181
start with the people who trust you

710
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:08,662
and understand how this works.

711
00:34:08,662 --> 00:34:09,362
Thank you.

712
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:09,662
Sure.

713
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,143
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna be kicked out.

714
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:15,368
I'm gonna answer questions right after.

715
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:17,131
Thank you so much.

716
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,194
Sorry for the last minute kind of thing.

717
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:20,857
I hope it was still valuable for you.

718
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:24,683
And have a great rest of UX Summit and GDC this week.

719
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:25,084
Bye bye.
