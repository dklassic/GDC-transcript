1
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:08,395
First is a talk about can you make a good game

2
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:09,757
with a good play mechanics.

3
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:14,881
But before that, let's starting by introduction of me a bit.

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,224
So my name is Sun, and the real name is Prasert Vidyagan.

5
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,826
And some people might already guess

6
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:25,529
that I come from Thailand, a country which

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,031
people have a very long name and too hard to pronounce

8
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,112
and to remember.

9
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,615
But so please feel free to call me and remember me as Sun.

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,215
So nice to meet you.

11
00:00:34,276 --> 00:00:40,600
So, I came from Thailand, but I actually now live in Japan for longer than 10 years now,

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,903
and I used to be a lead game designer for a game called Final Fantasy XV.

13
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:47,905
And I used to be in charge of these characters,

14
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:52,127
and implement the way their behavior in the real-time gameplay,

15
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:55,410
like how they walk, how they talk, what's inside their mind.

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,252
I write AI because I specialize in emotional AI and its application.

17
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:04,894
to the thing I call CX, which is Character Experience.

18
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:09,295
And our studio used to be part of Square Enix Japan,

19
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:11,736
but now we've become a different studio.

20
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:13,856
We call Luminous Productions,

21
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,497
and we're still under Square Enix Group,

22
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:17,077
but separate from Square Enix Japan.

23
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,858
And that's about me and my studio.

24
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:23,819
And, well, it's my third time here in GDC, though,

25
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,999
but I'm still so feeling excited to be here

26
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,800
and to talk with you today.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,200
And let's hope we get a good fun from my talk today.

28
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,162
So, let's get started.

29
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:34,683
So, can we make a good game without good play mechanics?

30
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:40,588
This is a very tricky question, but before we go there,

31
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:47,093
let me, for the sake of clarity and make sure we're on the same page,

32
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:51,917
let me define a bit what we think good gameplay mechanics is.

33
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:54,519
When we talk about good gameplay mechanics,

34
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:59,183
I mean clear goals and rules for the players,

35
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,744
meaningful sets of approaches,

36
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:05,389
appropriate challenges, and appropriate reward,

37
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,150
which is kind of straightforward.

38
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,090
So you might say that, well, a play mechanic

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,891
or a game mechanic is a quality

40
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,231
that makes a game a game itself.

41
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,232
So let's imagine we want to draw a graph

42
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:20,892
that represents balance between a fun

43
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:22,773
that comes from game mechanic

44
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,333
and a fun that comes from other aspect of game,

45
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,054
then we might get something like this for a game.

46
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:32,025
Right? So gameplay mechanics just come first.

47
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:36,148
But what about other media that is not game?

48
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,390
Such as interactive toy, interactive art,

49
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,893
interactive media, or some kind of applications?

50
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:45,395
You might get something else, maybe like this.

51
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:49,798
But why do I talk to you about this? Aren't we supposed to talk about game

52
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:55,322
in this lecture? The reason is, boundaries between

53
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:57,703
content genres have become vague these days.

54
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:02,243
In the past, games are games and non-games are non-games.

55
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:07,044
But now we get very gradations of genre happen in between

56
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:09,124
and there's a lot of contents in between.

57
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:13,005
And sometimes you get some kind of strange contents like,

58
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:14,386
well, a character social game

59
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:16,226
that you just push one buttons

60
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,487
and then just repeatedly push the button

61
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:19,687
and then they fight for you

62
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,408
and in the end you won the battles, but it's fun.

63
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:26,651
And sometimes you get something like a narrative VR experience,

64
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,432
which is very immersive,

65
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:31,214
but you rarely have anything to choose at all.

66
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,316
But it's fun.

67
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:36,979
Yes, and we can spend our 30 minutes here to define

68
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,040
what is game, which one is not,

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,502
which is probably game, and which one is probably not.

70
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:44,765
But I'm not going to do that today,

71
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:48,668
because no matter if you call them a game or not,

72
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:51,130
it's a game designer's job to design them anyway.

73
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,231
You see, we call ourselves game creators, game designers,

74
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:56,452
but actually our jobs are wider than that.

75
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,413
Sometimes we have to make some other things.

76
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,013
Maybe we should just call ourselves, I don't know,

77
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,474
interactive content designers, I don't know,

78
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:05,155
but we just call them game designers.

79
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,536
But it depends on your company and your project

80
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,896
on what you're actually making.

81
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:12,057
So make sure you ask yourself,

82
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,078
what the content or the game you make,

83
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:17,839
the fun balance of it, is something like this,

84
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,099
or like this, or like this.

85
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:27,423
And if your contents or your game that you are making has a bigger balance of fun from other aspects,

86
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:31,605
rather than gameplay mechanics, then what do we do as a game designer?

87
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:36,147
Should we just give up and let the writers write a good story?

88
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:37,908
No, maybe not like that.

89
00:04:37,908 --> 00:04:43,451
So, this lecture is not about talking that you should write good stories, you should have good...

90
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:49,358
graphic, but I'm here to tell you that game design is more than just game mechanic design.

91
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:55,742
It's more than play mechanic design. If you have a good game design, we can cover the other area, too.

92
00:04:55,742 --> 00:05:00,066
We can make sure that our game is more fun, and it might not be fun from play mechanics,

93
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:05,790
but it's fun that can only become when we apply a good game design to our games or our

94
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,272
contents that might or might not be game. I don't know.

95
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:15,317
So, if you say that a game mechanics design is a primary skill for a game designer,

96
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:21,363
then I might say that the non-game mechanic, but the game design skill,

97
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,466
is maybe a secondary skill that we actually need.

98
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:30,110
So, our goals today, so I'm not here to tell you that we don't need good gameplay mechanics,

99
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,071
we need it.

100
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,612
But, to learn how to see...

101
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:37,298
the values, other values game could possess from other perspective

102
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:41,801
might teach us how we can make game a better thing and might teach

103
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,363
how a new way for us to enhance our game

104
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:48,706
and because you're gonna need it someday and believe me you're really gonna need

105
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,267
it in the near and near futures

106
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:56,514
So the approach we're going to talk today and we're going to use today is the approach

107
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,875
I call defining the verbs.

108
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,958
So let's start with something simple, something that I like.

109
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,280
Personally, I really love ice cream.

110
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,261
So we do it with ice cream.

111
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:09,903
So what do people do with ice cream?

112
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,063
What do you do with ice cream?

113
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,305
Yeah, we eat.

114
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:20,008
So if we decide that the eat is a thing we do with ice cream, then we decide ice cream

115
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:24,211
to maximize taste, like what they do around here in San Francisco.

116
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:27,032
Some may recognize this, this is our famous ice cream in San Francisco.

117
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:33,576
I've been taking this picture around these days for the talk, but not for me, but yeah,

118
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:34,777
I love ice cream, though.

119
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:42,602
But if, what if we define another verb that people can do with ice cream, let's say, like,

120
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,242
to Instagram.

121
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,531
then can we get something else?

122
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,432
Maybe like this?

123
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:50,294
No, maybe no, because good designer

124
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:53,216
can balance visual and flavor.

125
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:55,938
So you don't have to define a new word for that.

126
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:58,881
We can still balance visuals and flavor, right?

127
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,703
But if, what if we put all we have

128
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:04,325
to the new word into Instagram?

129
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,107
What if we care about appearance

130
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:08,589
more than more equal than its flavor?

131
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,651
What do we get?

132
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,272
We might get something like this.

133
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:18,040
This is ice cream in Harajuku in Japan.

134
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,181
Very flashy.

135
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:21,624
And this is what happens when you define a new verb

136
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,446
to Instagram, when you invest everything you have

137
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:26,748
to a new value, the ice cream you possess

138
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:29,170
that might not be to eat, and you get something new.

139
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,051
You get a new product.

140
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:34,555
So it's applying to everything in our product designs.

141
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:37,718
When you get new verb, you get a new value for your product.

142
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:43,801
When you get new value, it means you can come up with new design approach for it.

143
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:47,403
And this is also applying to game too.

144
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:48,984
So what do people do with game?

145
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:54,911
If it's to play, if it's yes, then you need a good gameplay mechanic.

146
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,953
That's the way it should be.

147
00:07:56,953 --> 00:08:02,198
But if there are other words that we can define that players do with games, and if we can

148
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:07,803
define that, maybe we can find a new approach of thinking of how we can improve our games.

149
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,845
So that's what we're going to talk about today.

150
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:09,945
Verbs.

151
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:11,066
So today I've already...

152
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:19,964
I will tell you seven verbs here that people can do with game, starting from to play down

153
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:25,226
to the bottom of the list, which is the order of awareness to designers.

154
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:32,009
And we go one by one and see our newest perspective that we can get from game design.

155
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,590
And maybe you can...

156
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:40,966
We might get the same game or game design from the new perspective,

157
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:45,029
but to get a new perspective means you get a new tool for it.

158
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,872
So I think it's interesting that we explore these works together.

159
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:52,454
Starting from the first work to play, and then the second work, which is...

160
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,564
To explore.

161
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:57,145
To explore a game is fun.

162
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:04,069
And sometimes people mix it up, like, to play, because it's really close to each other.

163
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:08,892
But for me, to explore doesn't really need challenges, when to play needs challenges.

164
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:10,393
Imagine sightseeing.

165
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:11,414
We go sightseeing.

166
00:09:11,414 --> 00:09:12,755
We love sightseeing, right?

167
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,456
But why do people go sightseeing?

168
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:17,479
Do you really need a challenge there?

169
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:21,843
Like, if say, if you go to Bali, or you go to Phuket, I don't know,

170
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:25,646
and you don't have obstacle, you don't have challenge in your trip,

171
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:27,889
would that gonna make your trip feel boring?

172
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:35,347
Maybe no. It's fun anyway to see new things, to see unseen things, to face the unexperienced.

173
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:36,848
Exploring is fun in itself.

174
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:40,712
And there are lots of ways we can do to improve that.

175
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:47,338
But one technique I'm going to tell you today is the technique called itemizations and visualizations.

176
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:52,396
So when they say itemization, this mean to,

177
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:55,677
well, people brain can easily recognize

178
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,038
thing that is symbolized.

179
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:00,300
And it's good if we make this countable,

180
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,481
the number of thing that you haven't seen

181
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,982
or the location that you haven't been.

182
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:08,804
Imagine in the new seamless open world game,

183
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:10,105
is like radiation like this.

184
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:13,527
So it's cool and stuff, it's believable, but you don't.

185
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:17,537
You can't really count how many areas or how many places you have been

186
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:20,118
because it's all connected to one place.

187
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:23,560
And you feel like there's something missing about it.

188
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,402
You don't know where the area starts, you don't know where the area ends,

189
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,683
and your brain cannot recognize it easily.

190
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:32,985
And it would be better, like, imagine the old game

191
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:35,907
where all the maps are separated in this grid,

192
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:40,370
and it's really easy to recognize that I've been to this area or not this area.

193
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,181
And to solve this problem, there are lots of ways we can do.

194
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:49,565
And one thing we can do is to use visualization using UI.

195
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,906
Or you can use approaches that Japanese usually

196
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:56,690
do in their society, which is a thing called Stamp Rally.

197
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,711
That's in Japan.

198
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:01,253
Stamp Rally is an activity that when

199
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:03,375
in the festival and in the fair, the children

200
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,756
will get a paper of a kind of book.

201
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,178
And they have to visit lots of places to get a stamp.

202
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:12,420
And if you collect all the stamps, they're going to get a prize.

203
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,461
Now, this is technically a game, though,

204
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,202
but what I'd like to say is that you don't have to add this in the game,

205
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:22,125
but the process of having people to do something

206
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,826
when they go to some place is really clever,

207
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:28,988
because it symbolizes the idea that this area is one area.

208
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:33,330
So instead, you get the big, open world, seamless area

209
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,092
that cannot be easily defined as in locations.

210
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:41,214
When you put a point that people have to do something,

211
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:44,296
and you have people to do that, the user to do that,

212
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:47,377
people form a kind of imaginary boundaries

213
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:49,938
of the concept of what location it is.

214
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:51,859
And then they can make it, they can count it,

215
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:55,161
and they can feel that they can fill in some kind of list

216
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,202
and feel better when they do explorations.

217
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:58,903
This is one of the things we can do.

218
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,675
Another thing that might be interesting is to say that motivation might change during explorations.

219
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:08,717
First, it might be exploration for the sake of exploration,

220
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:13,242
but later on, when you nearly complete the list, it becomes exploration for the sake of completion,

221
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,504
which asks you to play a unique gameplay.

222
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:20,368
And that's not a bad thing, I just want to state that it's a kind of different thing.

223
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:25,472
So takeaway for exploration. Exploring is fun in itself.

224
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:29,836
Can we use itemization and visualization to add value more to the explorations?

225
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,718
And how do you use the sense of completion to urge the player to explore more?

226
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:36,541
Okay, so we go to the third, the next verb, which is the thing you can do with game, which is to

227
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:36,722
roleplay.

228
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,705
So, by roleplay, I mean you savour the characters and their interactions,

229
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:58,913
you savour the story, you savour the world itself by being a character.

230
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,416
And there are actually two types of roleplaying.

231
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:04,446
The first type is the being you type,

232
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:06,727
when you become an invader or a named character.

233
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,089
You customize it, you become someone.

234
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,551
Or the type of being him or her,

235
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,713
that you become a particular characters.

236
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,815
And, well, whichever is fine too,

237
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:19,878
but it's really important that we make it clear

238
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:21,259
about it in our design,

239
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,920
because we're gonna need different kinds

240
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,761
approach for our designs.

241
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,383
Let's go for the type being you first.

242
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:35,285
For it being your role-playing design, it's really important that we don't put too much detail as personalities into our characters,

243
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:40,889
and trying to leave in the room and allow a chance for the player to express the way they want to be,

244
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,672
express their thoughts, express their personalities into a character inside the game.

245
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,833
But if we only get...

246
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:50,712
the vague role for it.

247
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:52,672
Players will just gonna be themselves

248
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:54,733
like they are everyday,

249
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,394
which is maybe boring.

250
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:58,454
So, in contrary, it's really important

251
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,655
that we give them a concrete role

252
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:02,636
or concrete situation that players to act.

253
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:04,196
The role should be concrete,

254
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:05,356
so players know what to act.

255
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:08,237
But the details in it, the personality,

256
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,218
should be left open for the players to express themselves.

257
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,879
That's how you can balance the B&U type

258
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,920
role-playing design and have the players

259
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,060
have fun playing that role the best.

260
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:23,056
And there are other types called being him and her role-playing design.

261
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:28,362
And in the game that when that there are only cut scenes

262
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:31,705
Well, you can make a game like that, but it would be more like cinematics

263
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:38,232
But if you're making a game that and you want the user to role play to act as a character in the game

264
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:42,576
It's really important that you make sure that the character the people the user know

265
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:50,225
what character would do in each situation so they know how to act, especially in the first part of the game when

266
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:56,772
when the player doesn't really know much about the characters. So I would suggest we start with

267
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:04,920
stereotype stuff and then add some more detail the further on when users spend more long and long time with the characters inside the game.

268
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:12,204
And I've already talked about this a lot in my last year GDC talk about character experience design

269
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,945
in the talk called Walked on my friends, giving life to AI buddies in Final Fantasy XV.

270
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:20,487
And it was available in GDC vault, so if you have interest, please check on it.

271
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,988
I think it's very interesting topic too.

272
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:28,230
One more thing that we should state about being him or her role-playing design is that

273
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,232
don't ever let the player choose between being himself or being the characters.

274
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:40,612
One bad example of this is a game where you play as a character with a short temper,

275
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:46,036
and always say things before he thinks, and ruins everything.

276
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:49,137
So you want to be a more loyal player to the characters,

277
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,319
and inside the conversation you have a choice like this.

278
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:54,801
It's going to be fine, because whichever you choose,

279
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:59,244
you can be the character anyway, and you can express yourself by choosing A or B.

280
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:05,168
But what happened in many games and many developers is that they put a new choice like this,

281
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:12,674
which, you know, players want to choose it because they want to make the situation get better.

282
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:16,436
But as soon as you choose them, you're going to destroy the characters itself.

283
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:20,520
Because this character, he should think, he should talk because he thinks,

284
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,581
so he shouldn't come up with these kinds of things.

285
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:27,165
So you have to choose it and then he will go off of immersion, which is not good at all.

286
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:33,257
So, you can't stop player from being themself anyway, so make sure that all the choices

287
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:38,938
express characters, but different variation in choice choose express the user himself.

288
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:43,959
The choice choose, all choice should express characters, and user should choose one choice

289
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:44,900
to express themselves.

290
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,161
That is the best way to create a role-playing design game for being him or her type.

291
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:56,382
One last thing we should state about role-playing design is that about projection swifting.

292
00:16:57,243 --> 00:17:01,785
Although being him and her type role-playing design,

293
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:04,066
there are time that user become themselves,

294
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,728
and there are time that user become characters in game too.

295
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,409
And normally, player tends to be the character

296
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,891
in the part where there are much narrative stuff,

297
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:15,772
and they tend to be themselves in the part

298
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,053
where there's more freedom.

299
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:23,279
So, and this is completely fine, but we, as a game designer, we should be able to distinguish

300
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,405
both of this and make sure that we don't put, we don't allow unnecessary freedom to let

301
00:17:28,405 --> 00:17:34,472
the player destroy and to create conflict of what character should be.

302
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:35,893
So, takeaway.

303
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:37,975
So role-playing is fun in itself.

304
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,510
How do we define a concrete role for a player to act?

305
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,971
And how do we make a game that allows users to express themselves

306
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:53,254
without making a conflict to the given character settings?

307
00:17:53,254 --> 00:18:01,056
So we go to the next verb, which is to create. Well, creation is fun and I bet

308
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,737
that many users really want to be game creators.

309
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:08,278
But to... Well, we should turn user into creators, but...

310
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:14,199
Turning user into creator is not the same thing as turning user into designer.

311
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:20,684
It doesn't mean that we should give them level editor and have them do level design for themselves.

312
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,785
Creation can be more simple and more casual.

313
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:28,830
It could be something like customize the characters or take a picture, draw a picture, write something or name something.

314
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,452
like what they do in No Man's Sky,

315
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:37,516
where they allow you to name a new planet or a new species of animal when you discover them,

316
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:41,018
which is really clever, because creation can come very simply,

317
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,320
and there's no one who doesn't know how to name things.

318
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,783
But make sure that you have a way for people to share their creation with other users.

319
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:56,533
But however, there's one trap that usually happens now that putting a screenshot and

320
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,557
selfie system is a trend in our game industry.

321
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,281
So there's something like this.

322
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,845
Hey, I've added a screenshot selfie system in the game.

323
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:05,386
That's right.

324
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:09,228
Well, maybe it's not enough for me, I guess,

325
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:13,091
because some people might not, some user might not really want

326
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,372
to care and to use this kind of system.

327
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:18,535
And you might say that we don't want to force them.

328
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:21,957
Yes, we don't want to force them, but that means a waste,

329
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:23,818
a waste to turn that user into creators.

330
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:27,461
So the things that for me that I would do to,

331
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:29,663
the approach I would do to this problem is.

332
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:37,226
I think players' greatest creation is the gameplay they have or actually play itself.

333
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:39,787
The adventure itself is already a great creation.

334
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:46,110
If the game could find a way to turn the user gameplay, the adventure that it has been,

335
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,271
into something they could share easily, then I think it's going to be very simple.

336
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:55,896
Like what I did in Final Fantasy XV, where I have a snapshot system.

337
00:19:55,896 --> 00:20:01,940
So when you play the game, the AI characters automatically shoot a photo for you,

338
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,363
and in the night, they will show this photo for you, and you can share it.

339
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:08,925
And all they have to do is to press the share button,

340
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:13,469
although even if you're a player that does not care much about creating stuff,

341
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,091
you can still share it because it's simple.

342
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,513
But you can still be feel proud of it that it's your creations

343
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:25,157
because default is only yours and it wouldn't happen if you want to play the game.

344
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:29,840
So I've talked about this a lot in my last year GDC talk about Prompto Facebook,

345
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,882
how about the AI auto-snapshot your adventure in Final Fantasy XV.

346
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:35,083
And it's also available in the GDC vault.

347
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,764
So you have time, please check it.

348
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:40,927
So takeaway, creation is fun in itself.

349
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:45,782
Can we find a way to allow players to have that fun in our game?

350
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:49,526
Can we find a way for them to share their creations?

351
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:52,569
And for those players who doesn't care much about creations,

352
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:56,694
can we find a way to change the game experience into something,

353
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,036
into creation for them to share?

354
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,659
Because the play experience is the best creation

355
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,521
that the user has actually made.

356
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:13,121
Okay, we go to the next verb, which is to communicate.

357
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:16,984
To talk and to socialize is funny itself, right?

358
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,125
Maybe not.

359
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:24,179
Yes, sometimes it's fun, but most of the time it's a pain when it's forced.

360
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,162
Personally for me, I think conversation is the most painful type of communication.

361
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:36,449
Because if communication is a game, I saw that it's a game that allows users to force other users to do communication, you see.

362
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:39,011
I say something and someone has to reply to something.

363
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,474
And you're forced to say something, and that's not fun.

364
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:47,339
I mean, so maybe, I don't know, I don't think we need much verbal communication in a game.

365
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,681
Instead, I think we should make good use of instinctive communication urges, like nurturing

366
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,002
and prank.

367
00:21:56,002 --> 00:22:01,984
For nurturing, I believe that people in Indonesia, they love to help each other.

368
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:06,185
If given the right situation and the right grammar to do so, they would do so.

369
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:11,707
A good example of this is for Dragon Quest X, which is an online game, and in the world

370
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,468
map you can see other people fighting monsters in the world map.

371
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,549
And you cannot go and help them by directly killing monsters,

372
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:23,311
but you can use a share command to help them give a buff stat for the other users.

373
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:26,453
And what do you get? You don't technically get anything, you get thank you.

374
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:29,814
But you do it anyway, because people like to do that.

375
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:33,215
And you do it and you feel fun, and their communication happens.

376
00:22:33,215 --> 00:22:38,297
That's a good way to encourage communication in the game, which is fun, and not forcing.

377
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,058
One more thing is that prank.

378
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:43,179
Prank is fun. Everyone loves to do prank.

379
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:47,200
But if the game suggests it too obviously and makes it too painful,

380
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,721
it's not going to be good.

381
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,521
But there's a wise way to do it.

382
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:55,342
And there's one good example of one of the mobile games for girls

383
00:22:55,342 --> 00:23:00,184
which allows you to create your own boyfriend inside the game.

384
00:23:00,184 --> 00:23:02,725
And you are allowed to, well...

385
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:07,146
dress your boyfriend in a stylish fashion and stylish costume.

386
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:11,127
And since it's a game about fashion, there's a feature that you

387
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:15,009
can recommend the clothes, the costume to other people's boyfriends

388
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:18,130
and you can change other people's boyfriend's costume

389
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,271
and dress. So people use these functions to change

390
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,952
other people's boyfriend into something like this.

391
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:30,238
Or they can actually recommend a swimsuit or other people's boyfriends,

392
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:33,560
which technically means you can undress other people's boyfriends.

393
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,501
And they do this all the time.

394
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:39,022
So when users get back home and log into the game,

395
00:23:39,022 --> 00:23:41,784
they're going to be surprised to see their boyfriend naked

396
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:44,805
or dressed in stained stuff, and they're going to laugh,

397
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:46,846
and they're going to say, OK, I want to revenge this.

398
00:23:46,846 --> 00:23:48,266
And they're going to find some other players,

399
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:51,228
and they share, they recommend other dresses,

400
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,609
and undress them, and do whatever.

401
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,050
And their communication happens.

402
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:00,633
And what's interesting is that the game makers never tell people to use this system for pranking.

403
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,895
They all know that this is a fun way to use this system,

404
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:08,278
and their communication comes in, and it's not forced.

405
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:10,839
So this is a good example of doing this.

406
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,421
So communication is fun when it's not forced.

407
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:16,943
Can we give the right situation and the right grammar to do so?

408
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:19,185
Can we encourage nurturing?

409
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:21,026
And can we subtly suggest pranking?

410
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:29,238
The next verb is to broadcast and to watch.

411
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:32,460
So now game has become more sports, like eSports.

412
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,341
So when we design game, we should design game

413
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,062
that is not only fun to play,

414
00:24:36,062 --> 00:24:38,343
but a game that is fun to watch also.

415
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,145
The game doesn't mean for the audience.

416
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,186
But maybe most of us here in this room

417
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:45,388
doesn't create eSports game, right?

418
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:47,849
So I don't make eSports game,

419
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,650
so this is concern me, right?

420
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,111
Well, wrong.

421
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,598
Because live streaming has become one of the new standards

422
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:57,199
that the user use to enjoy the game in general,

423
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,259
not only for eSports.

424
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,300
And actually, I admit to you that this is not

425
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,000
for streaming and stuff.

426
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,281
It's not the area of my expertise.

427
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,841
So I cannot go too much deep into this topic.

428
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,162
But still, I feel the need to talk with this to you guys.

429
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:13,883
Because we know that streaming happens in our game.

430
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:18,884
But not many put this into their design process.

431
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,184
We know it's happened.

432
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:21,205
We neglect it.

433
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:21,865
But what about?

434
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:27,547
But it's time me and you start to think of this seriously and try to put it in our game

435
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:28,647
design process.

436
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:33,428
Can we think of a game design that can turn users into streamers more?

437
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:36,850
And can we make a game that is fun to stream and fun to watch?

438
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:42,712
I think that's a good homework for both of us to find a new generation for our game design.

439
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:51,977
And the last keyword is a new keyword too, which is to fan create.

440
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:57,739
So when you say fan creation, I mean fan fiction, fan art, doujinshi, fan game, anything that fandom creates.

441
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,821
And this is similar to the last keyword.

442
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:07,284
So we know that it's happened, there is something in it, but we normally don't care and put that in our design process.

443
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:09,865
But you see, making fan fiction, making fan art is fun.

444
00:26:10,425 --> 00:26:12,786
And if that's the way the user enjoys our game,

445
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:16,207
so why not we design our game to make that happen?

446
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,807
But how do we make it happen?

447
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:20,328
What kind of game design we make to make sure

448
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,529
that the user is going to love our game?

449
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:25,509
Because a game that has many fans

450
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:29,030
is not the same thing as a game that has many fan creations.

451
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:37,321
To think about this, we must analyze first from the reason, from what fans actually create.

452
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:40,862
Fans normally don't create a new game because it's difficult,

453
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:44,243
and fans normally don't create new characters.

454
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:48,784
But fans usually create a new story from the already existed characters.

455
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:53,345
So you can say that characters are a story machine in itself.

456
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,526
It's a catalyst for contents.

457
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:57,266
As long as you have interesting characters,

458
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,727
they're going to be the chemicals.

459
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,411
stuff between that and they're gonna be constant going on and on.

460
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:07,895
So what's really important to that you make sure that you create a

461
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:08,796
character that

462
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:09,797
they care about.

463
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,373
When they say the character they care about, it means the character that they cannot neglect,

464
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:19,536
the character that feels something about it. The feeling could be anything. It could be love,

465
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:25,459
even hate, even curiosity, want to know more about characters. Hate is fine too, anything is fine.

466
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:30,842
The worst thing that could ever happen to your game character is that no one cares about that,

467
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:35,085
everyone forgets about that, you don't feel anything about that. So hate is completely fine.

468
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:38,766
And when people feel something about your characters,

469
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:41,687
they're gonna have a wish in their mind.

470
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:43,068
Like with love, they're gonna wish

471
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:44,408
for his and her happiness.

472
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:46,589
They're gonna wish other love him and her too.

473
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:49,750
With hate, they're gonna wish for his and her unhappiness.

474
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,571
Wish other to hate him and her too.

475
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:54,912
With curiosity, they want to learn,

476
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:55,712
they want to analyze it,

477
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,413
and want to learn more the characters.

478
00:27:57,413 --> 00:27:58,333
And when they know something,

479
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,374
they want to share it to other user too.

480
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:02,695
And what important is this wishes.

481
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:10,377
become inspirations because the user can make their wishes come true by creating new contents.

482
00:28:10,377 --> 00:28:12,640
And that becomes fan creations.

483
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,967
So I think the most important thing is that wish is the base inspiration for fan creations

484
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,471
and it could happen when you create the character that they care about.

485
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,441
So the takeaway is that being a fan is fun,

486
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,442
and it's even more fun to create a new thing

487
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:28,562
inspired by the game.

488
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:32,404
Since the characters are the energy source of the fandom,

489
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:34,485
can we make sure that we create the characters

490
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,206
that the user will care,

491
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,347
and can we create their wishes for the characters?

492
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,164
So here we are, seven verbs here today, which are related to fun.

493
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:47,550
And what's important is that, especially for the last two,

494
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,553
we already know it's exit, but we never put it

495
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,395
until our game design loop.

496
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:53,538
But I think it's time that we do.

497
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:56,141
Before I end today, let's go to the last trap.

498
00:28:56,822 --> 00:29:01,488
If I announce you today that I've already made a new game like this

499
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,670
Well, actually it's for children age 4 and 6

500
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,533
But I didn't tell it to you, sir, and I have you play

501
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:09,717
And you played it and say, my game is silly and it's too easy

502
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:12,100
And complain about my game, should I care?

503
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,824
Well, maybe not, because I created this game for 4 and 6 age, year old kid

504
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:20,791
What I like to say is that you can't possibly please everyone with one content.

505
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:24,654
You have to focus on your target and sell the right game to the right people.

506
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:29,779
When I told you at the first of this talk that you should know the fund balance between

507
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:36,466
your games, it's really important too that you try to estimate what your user expects

508
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,867
your game content balance to be.

509
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,080
Although if you create a very fun game, they come from other aspects,

510
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,502
but if your user expects your game to be fun from gameplay mechanics,

511
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:48,143
they won't be satisfied with your games.

512
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:51,605
So user expectation control is really important.

513
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:55,687
Don't let the user expect and be disappointed by whatever we can give them

514
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:57,187
or don't plan to give them at all.

515
00:29:57,187 --> 00:30:02,250
So for the conclusions, can we make a good game with good play mechanics?

516
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,432
Yes, depending on the content you make and your user expectation too.

517
00:30:08,331 --> 00:30:15,716
Play mechanic is a super powerful tool, but to rely only to it will limit the possibilities of what your game could be.

518
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:22,320
So, let's be a game creator who knows how to make a good game with both good play mechanics and other approaches too.

519
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,302
The end. Thank you very much.
