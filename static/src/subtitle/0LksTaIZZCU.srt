1
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,195
So, my name is Justin Corey.

2
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:10,876
I've been working at Servios for about four years

3
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:11,856
as a lead artist.

4
00:00:12,736 --> 00:00:16,717
Joined the company in 2014, worked on raw data,

5
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:18,458
and then once we wrapped that up,

6
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:22,379
moved to this awesome music experience called Electronauts.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,161
So, Electronauts is not a game, it's not a tool,

8
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,522
it's an experience.

9
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:32,362
It's a music creation experience.

10
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,643
And it's one of those things that...

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,601
You can't quite put your finger on it,

12
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,283
what you're going to do with it, because it's just,

13
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,546
the art is driven by the engineering.

14
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,369
And OK, quick shout out to Raw Data,

15
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:50,053
first VR game to generate 1 million in less than a month,

16
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:52,094
and the first VR exclusive game to top number one

17
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:53,936
on Steam's global sales charts.

18
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,839
And we just released Sprint Factor recently,

19
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,581
where we patented the fluid locomotion technology.

20
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,384
And again, top number one on Steam and Oculus.

21
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,977
So let's talk about the visual language of electronauts.

22
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:11,139
So what you'll see here is our electronaut.

23
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,280
He's pretty funky, he's pretty awesome.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,021
He's an astronaut who plays music.

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:16,902
And let's go over the story.

26
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:18,182
Electro-universal.

27
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:24,369
In the future, humanity harnesses the power of the harmonic wavelength known as the electro-harmonic

28
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:24,689
grid.

29
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,753
While rippling through the depths of the universe, a great disruption in the harmonic fields

30
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:32,917
causes the electronauts to become separated, lost in four different quadrants of space,

31
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:35,560
cosmic, technology, alien, and psychic.

32
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,544
You must groove through each zone and use your melodic resonance spheres to make the

33
00:01:40,624 --> 00:01:41,806
universe dance and unite.

34
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:43,487
It's time to get the band back together.

35
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:49,817
And okay, first term, one of these terms was used often

36
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,879
when describing the electronauts and something

37
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,180
that we adhere to, which is synesthesia.

38
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,882
It's a perceptual phenomenon in which the stimulation

39
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:00,404
of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads

40
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,385
to automatic involuntary experiences

41
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,887
in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

42
00:02:05,808 --> 00:02:09,430
Best way to describe this is you hear music, you dance.

43
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,251
It's one of these things that you just can't control.

44
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,693
And yeah, it plays a big part in the game here.

45
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:20,601
And when I first heard this term, it was by a man named Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

46
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:24,285
If you guys work in games and you don't know his name, for shame.

47
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,887
He's been around for quite a while.

48
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:30,712
Worked at Sega, responsible for the Sega Rally series,

49
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,275
Rez, and Space Channel 5.

50
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,920
So he says, the majority of music games fall

51
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,021
into the category of rhythm based or time based,

52
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:39,802
Mizuguchi says.

53
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:41,544
That's not where my interest is.

54
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,585
Rather, it's more about how the layering of music

55
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,427
with visuals changes the world that you're in.

56
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:48,049
And that becomes an experience in and of itself.

57
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,771
So very cool.

58
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:50,852
It's not just about the game.

59
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:53,114
He's more interested in just getting your attention.

60
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:56,236
So let's talk about the music reality engine.

61
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,938
This is something that Servios developed.

62
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,181
It's our core technology for electronics.

63
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:21,375
Okay, so you might say, what is the music reality engine?

64
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:26,199
It's essentially a technology that allows a person to be a performer,

65
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,521
even if they are not the most musically inclined.

66
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:32,765
It's a beautiful piece of technology because for me, you know,

67
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:36,208
I've tried to play instruments all my life and never fully succeeded.

68
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:40,112
And then, you know, the minute I touch this game or this experience,

69
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:43,314
it just changes everything and you can have fun with it, you get lost in it forever.

70
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,184
So moving on to our inspirations,

71
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,685
and again, Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

72
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,887
Space Channel 5 was, again, one of the first games

73
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:52,467
that we discussed when we talked about kind of

74
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,789
the fun nature and the language of the game.

75
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,330
It's one of those things that as you play,

76
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,491
the experience grows, the environment moves more,

77
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,492
the colors shift more.

78
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:05,154
It really rewards you for performing well.

79
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:08,055
And it's just something that we kind of inherently

80
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,736
built into the Electronauts game.

81
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,993
EDM also a very big influence on our game.

82
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:22,635
The colors, the strobing patterns, the embodiment of nature and science and math,

83
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:25,295
lots of geometric shapes, lots of movement.

84
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:28,516
You'll see these heavily used in our visualizers.

85
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:34,578
Space, another big inspiration, especially in terms of color palette.

86
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:41,455
You'll see a lot of these nebulas share very similar and almost cosmic-like colors

87
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:45,996
that inherently just kind of happen to be included in our game.

88
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:51,678
And yeah, it's just such a beautiful thing to look at and really just, again,

89
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:55,540
you'll see it everywhere when you're just carooning through the space.

90
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:59,185
So let's move on to the Prodigy One.

91
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:02,047
Prodigy One is essentially the hub.

92
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:06,091
It's the place where you start any song

93
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:06,992
that you're about to play.

94
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:10,516
It's essentially a radio station in space.

95
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,038
You're broadcasting yourself out,

96
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,440
and you see this tunnel, you get launched through it

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,022
every time you go to your next track.

98
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:20,185
So this concept was originally done by Brian Higgins.

99
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,691
Great guy, very, very awesome and talented person.

100
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,811
So when I joined the company,

101
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,392
or I mean the project more like it,

102
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,832
there wasn't really a very clear direction

103
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:31,213
in terms of where things were gonna go.

104
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,793
We were going very hard sci-fi,

105
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:35,974
and while it's cool,

106
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:39,715
didn't exactly reflect the kind of experience

107
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:40,415
we wanted to bring.

108
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:43,736
So really without trying to shake up things too much

109
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:44,777
or change things too much,

110
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:47,898
I kind of tried to make a few quick

111
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,203
adjustments to the visual style of the game.

112
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,624
It was really just about bringing the color palette

113
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,365
to something that matched the mood.

114
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,566
So we kind of moved into this direction.

115
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,968
Incorporating more music into the environment.

116
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:05,030
Turning the look of the sci-fi to something

117
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,171
that you'd find more in a, like a, you know,

118
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:08,091
audio equipment.

119
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,652
So looking at the materials that you'd find

120
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,873
in audio equipment was like a big inspiration

121
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,874
for the kinds of shapes that we'd use for the environment.

122
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:17,296
You can see at the bottom right corner,

123
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:18,636
that is your launch tunnel.

124
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:21,630
And we wanted the decorator to look like a stage

125
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,351
like if you were performing at a concert.

126
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,733
For me, I think that was the biggest selling point,

127
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:29,755
is that because people are about to go off into these zones,

128
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:32,376
you want them to feel like they're about to, you know,

129
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:33,237
enter a stage.

130
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:35,158
So that was a big, big selling point for me.

131
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,639
And these are the concepts again.

132
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,781
These are a combination of some of the modeling blockouts

133
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:44,503
that I did in conjunction with paint overs that Brian did.

134
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,262
So here is the in-game shot of a very epic sequence

135
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,243
where you're flying from space,

136
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:55,864
you enter into this ship through a large tunnel,

137
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,124
and then you land into this hangar,

138
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:00,225
which is there where you'll launch out to your next song.

139
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,506
So this is the Prodigy 1 interior in real time.

140
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:06,166
And here's our launch tunnel in real time.

141
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,147
This environment.

142
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:12,227
was very, very intimidating to build.

143
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,390
The scale of it is just absolutely massive.

144
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:17,913
When you see a character inside of this environment

145
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:21,798
in relation to everything else, it's just, it's dwarfing.

146
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,841
And the trick is to find the right balance of scale

147
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,824
and the balance of detail, and also get it done on time,

148
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,807
which was not much time to do.

149
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,235
But you'll see we've got, you know, a lot of the colors

150
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,476
that the nebula is represented, all represented here.

151
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,277
Very unified.

152
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:40,018
And when you're in there, everything's just bumping.

153
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:40,779
Music's going.

154
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:41,719
Speakers are moving.

155
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:42,940
Lights are strobing.

156
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,220
It's very, very awesome.

157
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,762
So here's the Progeny 1 exterior.

158
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:50,564
So remember when I told you we fly into this ship?

159
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:52,184
Well, this is the ship that you fly into.

160
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:54,806
Again, another awesome concept by Brian Higgins.

161
00:07:56,606 --> 00:08:02,292
So my goal here was to try and recreate this as best as possible while also making it performant.

162
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,014
Not the easiest task.

163
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:08,098
So let's look at the literal translation of this into 3D.

164
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,000
So here's my take on it.

165
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,564
We move away from concept and we start getting some details in there.

166
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:17,487
And this is the polished piece that is now the Prodigy 1.

167
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:20,970
The rail gun on the front is kind of like...

168
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,374
A really powerful image to look at because it just makes you feel, you know you're just

169
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:26,956
getting shot straight out of there.

170
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:32,224
It's very clear, it's very direct, it's just incredibly interesting shapes.

171
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:35,528
And again, attaching speakers to everything was just a big motif.

172
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,092
Wanted to beat you in the head with it.

173
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,380
Here's a back shot.

174
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,741
So, you know, one of my difficulties,

175
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,224
yes I'll get concept, but then I don't necessarily know

176
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:50,186
exactly all the details that need to go into it, right?

177
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:55,570
So, again, trying to look at references of audio equipment,

178
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,012
just general turntables,

179
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,453
everything that I could get my hands on,

180
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,655
I start incorporating that into this ship.

181
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:04,897
Get a little closer here.

182
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:11,196
Again, in this year's scale of these things, the biggest trick is balancing the small details

183
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,217
to the large details.

184
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:18,122
And you'll see here to your right is the back end of the ship, which you need to get probably

185
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,044
the majority of the love because that's what you see the most.

186
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:27,411
And I'm very happy with the end result and, you know, I think ultimately it really served

187
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,011
its purpose.

188
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:31,695
And once you fly into that back end, it's pretty epic.

189
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:35,785
So moving on, then we have the Wave Rider.

190
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:39,928
Wave Rider is, again, this is what you're always

191
00:09:39,989 --> 00:09:41,890
flying through or flying inside of

192
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,271
as you're going through your visualizers.

193
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,914
It's a very fun looking ship.

194
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,356
Originally I wanted it to be like a Cadillac,

195
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,977
like a space Cadillac,

196
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:51,118
because it's kind of like this motif

197
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:52,739
that I've always thought about for quite a while,

198
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,021
especially when this game popped up.

199
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,664
But ultimately we kind of settled on something

200
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:58,604
that was a bit more unified

201
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:00,066
for the look of the entire environment.

202
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:03,666
But yeah, still very cool, got equalizers,

203
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:04,567
speakers everywhere.

204
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,570
I think the idea is that everything is propelled forward

205
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,791
by sound, audio waves.

206
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:16,416
And then here's shots of the Wave Rider in game.

207
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,338
Pretty good translation, you know,

208
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,401
not exactly ideal or identical,

209
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,962
but still very happy with the look of it.

210
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,565
But yeah, it's a,

211
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:31,978
very cool place to be on in the inside as well. Unfortunately I don't have a shot of the

212
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:36,161
actual interior of that. But you'll hopefully get a chance to go down and play it today

213
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:43,526
because it's on the show floor. Okay, so let's talk about our Electronaut. So we had a

214
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:49,530
wonderful character concept artist named Keegan. He came on board in the middle of the

215
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,111
project and was really just spending

216
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,438
a lot of time just kind of fleshing out the design,

217
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,260
trying to take it to a little more fun direction

218
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,880
than just straight sci-fi and astronaut.

219
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,981
And ultimately we ended up moving into this direction.

220
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,262
Very colorful, very vibrant,

221
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,102
matches the environment, matches the ships.

222
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,903
Just very fun and wacky.

223
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,984
This character model was done by Daman Woods.

224
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,565
He's our lead character artist at the company.

225
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:19,905
He's a busy man.

226
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,305
He does a lot of character work for us.

227
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,292
And here's a look at some of our visualizers that we designed.

228
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,573
These were done by Gabriel Valdivia.

229
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:32,634
Gabe is also a tech artist at the company,

230
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:36,395
and a very talented guy, very creative guy.

231
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,735
Really, really, really enjoyed the inspirations

232
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:39,775
that he put into this game.

233
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:44,257
And also, you can see in this image

234
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,377
is a couple examples of our instruments.

235
00:11:47,157 --> 00:11:49,418
The spheres you see in front of you are the harmonic spheres.

236
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:51,738
These are the initial instruments that you

237
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,859
use to generate your audio.

238
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,581
Very, very intuitive, very simple, and very fun.

239
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:00,084
Disco balls were a big inspiration for these guys

240
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:03,727
because initially the visual look of the game

241
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:07,249
was not dictated by the art direction,

242
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,151
but more by the technology, right?

243
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:10,692
And what the designers put in.

244
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,534
So it was all very, very prototyped,

245
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:16,216
but once you started using it,

246
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,277
you didn't want to change it.

247
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:20,059
You didn't want the art to then take over the experience.

248
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,880
So we had to kind of accommodate those things.

249
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,171
The things below you are your decks.

250
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,075
You'll see these nice hovering

251
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,418
or these nice holographic patterns coming from the bottom.

252
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,681
And these cubes that are inserted

253
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:35,365
into each one are your different instruments

254
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,988
and your different ways to interface with the.

255
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:38,787
the whole experience.

256
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,728
On our left, we have our backtracks,

257
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:42,289
which you can queue up and set up.

258
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,531
And then we also have filter cubes to the right of that,

259
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,712
those gray cubes.

260
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,174
And then to the right of the center,

261
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,235
you'll see that there's a few other colored cubes.

262
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:52,656
Those are your other instruments,

263
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:54,177
and there's some fun stuff there to play with.

264
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:57,880
So.

265
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:00,497
Another great visualizer by Gabriel.

266
00:13:00,517 --> 00:13:02,457
I believe part of the Tech Zone.

267
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:05,419
It also has one of our other instruments

268
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:06,619
called the Lava Loops.

269
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,341
So this was also again a very gray box kind of thing.

270
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:13,362
It was just a cylinder with a cylinder on top of it.

271
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:14,762
And you know.

272
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:19,472
You don't really know what to do with something like that because again it's an interface

273
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,813
and you don't want to change the way it works.

274
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:24,617
So I just said, okay, well, you know, why not make it a lava lamp or something like

275
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,203
that because, you know, as a kid I remember having those in high school and, you know,

276
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,185
they're kind of a part of the whole psychedelia.

277
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:35,430
They can be totally related and everybody recognizes these in some fashion.

278
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:39,402
So yeah, I think it turned out pretty well.

279
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:40,363
I like what they did with it.

280
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,784
And again, once you see what the interaction is

281
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,364
with these things and the music and the sounds

282
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:47,085
that they produce, it's pretty awesome.

283
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,927
And then two of my, actually,

284
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,288
one of my most favorite is this synth orb right here.

285
00:13:55,517 --> 00:14:01,080
It's kind of like one of those plasma globes that you get when you're a kid where you touch it with your finger and the electricity sparks to it.

286
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,243
That was like one of the initial things as we were playing with it, and it had a few iterations, but

287
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:11,158
Of course, when you touch it, you kind of didn't know what you were getting out of it.

288
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:15,581
And once we turned it into this plasma type effect, it became very clear how you interact

289
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:15,841
with it.

290
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:17,762
It has all kinds of layers to it.

291
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:22,045
It's a 3D interaction, so you can move inside, outside, up and down on it.

292
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,167
It creates some very interesting noises.

293
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,188
And then we have a harp that's kind of like...

294
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:28,930
It's a very fun one to play with.

295
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,853
There's also kind of a tough one for the designers to really...

296
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:39,620
to really believe in but I think they kind of figured out how the interaction should work

297
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,622
because plucking something in VR is actually not that simple. But they solved that pretty

298
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:53,466
nicely. Let's see... Here's one more visualizer... And then... Okay. Actually this is also

299
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:59,269
cool. So these tracks on our right, we just recently incorporated audio, I mean voice work.

300
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:00,590
So before it was all just...

301
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:07,638
instruments, right? And then getting actual voices into the game was a tough challenge.

302
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:14,225
How do we get vocals to work? So one of the most interesting and one of the last things

303
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:18,089
that kind of got into the game was this vocal track system. And again, please do try it

304
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,251
when you get in there. It's a ton of stuff to play with.

305
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:28,138
And lastly, it looks like we have our audio grenades.

306
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:29,838
So these are things that are kind of like one offs

307
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,360
that you can throw into the air and just have fun with

308
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,841
and they explode and make a cool noise.

309
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,845
And again, I would say when it comes to the visualizers,

310
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,026
I can't speak for Gabe and his inspirations,

311
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:45,767
but for sure this one you see right here

312
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:46,608
is one of my favorite

313
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,209
and I don't know if you guys have ever played OutRun,

314
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,590
but it's an old Sega arcade game.

315
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,830
Essentially, as you're playing and hitting the instruments,

316
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,631
you're going to see these waves fly by that

317
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,752
are like cars on a track.

318
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:02,213
And I think, in general, a lot of the look of these visualizers

319
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,374
were heavily inspired by the 80s and the synth wave, which

320
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:09,355
I think is just a very cool thing to see come back.

321
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,651
The 80s had a big part in the overall visual direction of this game.

322
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:18,755
Kind of gaudy, kind of outrageous, very colorful, very neon,

323
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:22,758
but ultimately, it really sells the idea of technology, the future,

324
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:26,801
and then the type of music that we're all interested in, which is electronic music.

325
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,944
And then, that's pretty much it.

326
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,626
So, thank you guys for letting me come out.

327
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:38,991
I really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and I hope you guys get a chance to get on the show floor and play the game.

328
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,999
How are we doing on time by the way?

329
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,881
Plenty, okay.

330
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:03,446
Questions, yes.

331
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,092
Like how much time did it take to create each one?

332
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:14,054
It really ranged depending on like

333
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,735
from concept to execution.

334
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:18,016
I think anywhere between two to three weeks.

335
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,606
Luckily, a lot of the elements that make up those visualizers are relatively simple objects,

336
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,008
but it's more about how do you tie all that together.

337
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,711
They're also very reactive to what you're doing.

338
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:34,436
They're not just these things that are looping behind you, but colors are shifting, scales

339
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:38,741
of things are changing, the rate of these things are all being affected by your performance.

340
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,916
Gabe will love you for saying that.

341
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:46,077
He worked very hard on these visualizers.

342
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:49,297
And another guy, James Littlejohn,

343
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,038
he's one of our VFX and tech artists.

344
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:53,159
A lot of the effects that you see,

345
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,339
all the instrumentation,

346
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:57,820
every little detail that's not readily apparent

347
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,960
is all done by him as well.

348
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,941
And those guys work very closely together

349
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:01,981
to help create that look.

350
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:05,865
So I had a quick question.

351
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:06,526
Sure.

352
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:09,508
For folks who naturally play instruments and stuff like that,

353
00:18:10,628 --> 00:18:11,589
they obviously have a leg up.

354
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,251
But those who are new to it, what kind of visual language

355
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:15,972
did you use to cue them as to when

356
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:19,914
would be a good time to hit a crescendo or stay on the beat?

357
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:23,897
Or did you guys problematically just push it to stay on beat?

358
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,878
I think at the end of the day, because

359
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:27,159
of the

360
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:32,685
music reality engine and what we're doing under the hood,

361
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:34,626
no matter when they decide to hit that orb,

362
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,307
it's going to sound right on beat.

363
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:39,969
As somebody who is more musically inclined than others,

364
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,911
you're going to have a much better time at performing,

365
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,552
right, but for those that are just,

366
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,033
they've never really picked up an instrument,

367
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,074
they don't know how to dance,

368
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:49,035
or they don't know how to keep a beat,

369
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,737
it's gonna make you sound as good as it can,

370
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:52,097
and it does pretty well.

371
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:54,139
I mean, you can go pretty crazy on that stuff,

372
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,740
and it just ends up sounding really great.

373
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,083
But yeah, for those that are inclined and have some experience, it's going to only enhance

374
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:01,883
that that much more.

375
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:07,146
I mean, what I show you in those images does not really explain the amount of depth that

376
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:07,947
that thing has.

377
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:12,249
It's just absolutely amazing how much you can actually do.

378
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:19,173
So you can queue up sequences, you can have all kinds of modulation going on.

379
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:24,475
It's just, it becomes just an experience and then becomes more

380
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,236
of like a production environment if you want it to be.

381
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,497
So the layering is just absolutely crazy.

382
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:33,678
I remember just when it first started it was just the orbs,

383
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,119
right, and it was just that alone was enough

384
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,100
to keep me going for a long time.

385
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,421
And I mean anybody who gets in there winds up playing

386
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,822
for 45 minutes to an hour straight and you have

387
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,903
to pull them out because they just won't leave it, which is.

388
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:49,186
pretty much speaks for itself in how awesome it can be.

389
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,688
I think inherently everybody wants to be a performer,

390
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,752
everybody wants to be able to be the cool guy

391
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,513
who's playing and DJing at the club,

392
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:59,435
and it really gives you that opportunity to do that.

393
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:01,457
I mean, we got, you know, awesome thing,

394
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:02,918
we got to be at South by Southwest,

395
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,521
and we were performing on stage there,

396
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,543
and it was a great feeling to see that.

397
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:09,584
I was really proud for the guys.

398
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:15,736
And another thing to keep in mind is a lot of the audio tracks that you hear in the game are not just

399
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:20,639
musicians but the engineers that made the game. So these guys are, you know, they love music, they

400
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:25,623
really believe in music, they take it very seriously even though it's a very fun and wacky game, but

401
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:28,905
they spend an insane amount of time building the technology. And all I did was come in

402
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,466
and kind of try to help make sense of what they built

403
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,346
and give it some visuals to it, right?

404
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:36,307
I certainly didn't join the project as an art director.

405
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:39,147
I'm just the lead artist who is there

406
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:41,308
to help get things done and help move things forward.

407
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,448
And since I did come in so late,

408
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:46,609
it was kind of like, we just knew we had

409
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,749
to enhance everything a bit more.

410
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,769
Because I mean, I always felt it could stand on its own,

411
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:51,650
to be perfectly honest.

412
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,030
I was just happy that I was allowed to come in

413
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,031
and add some extra speckle to it, you know?

414
00:20:58,311 --> 00:20:58,791
Cool, thanks.

415
00:20:59,118 --> 00:20:59,279
Mm-hmm.

416
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:03,561
Hi.

417
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:06,383
You mentioned that the engineering was the one that

418
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:07,663
influenced the art direction.

419
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:07,903
Yeah.

420
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,665
Was there a point during the development

421
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,246
that it was the other way around,

422
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,887
like the art direction influenced

423
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,329
how things would be made or the design of the game?

424
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,930
I would say absolutely no.

425
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,711
I mean, when it comes to something like this,

426
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:26,546
My job is just to enhance and help, right?

427
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:29,388
I have no interest in letting my art dictate

428
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,269
how you interact with things

429
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:33,611
and just how you are supposed to experience everything.

430
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:35,972
I just wanna help drive what they've built

431
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:38,114
and make it something pretty to look at

432
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:39,154
and something fun to look at.

433
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:44,077
Again, if there was really nothing else but making the music, I still think it would just

434
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:44,777
be amazing.

435
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,618
So it's hard to say.

436
00:21:46,698 --> 00:21:52,560
Like the only major influence I had overall was just this introduction sequence that many

437
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,801
people have not gotten to see yet.

438
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:06,572
So visually speaking, I noticed that you changed the design of the first area where the ships

439
00:22:06,632 --> 00:22:08,193
were to match the color scheme.

440
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:13,835
How did, like, how was this process of balancing, like, say, the visualizers color schemes with

441
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,596
the overall color scheme of the game?

442
00:22:15,976 --> 00:22:19,838
Because I feel like it can get pretty distracting if you have, like, a bunch of, like, yellows

443
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:22,780
and oranges with a bunch of, like, blues and purples in there.

444
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:28,128
Well, it's one of those things, I mean, if you go to these festivals, you go to these concerts, right,

445
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:32,992
it's all about the distraction. It's just an eye festival, it's eye candy everywhere,

446
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:38,176
and part of that is just the culture of it, right? It's, again, psychedelia. It's all about

447
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:43,420
trying to overload your sensory, your sensors with whatever you can, be it the music and then

448
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:51,366
the visuals. But I do worry about, like, if that inhibits the player from playing the game, like...

449
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:58,088
I certainly think, if anything, the player is always just focused on what's in front of them.

450
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:03,611
You know what I mean? It's very rare that you're taking your eyes away from your instrument, right?

451
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,933
Everything else around you is there for everybody else to observe and enjoy.

452
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,435
It's not necessarily for you as a performer.

453
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:15,997
So really, as people are playing their music...

454
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:19,386
You want these really bombastic visuals going on in the background.

455
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:20,867
You do want these strobing elements.

456
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:23,788
I mean, it's just the nature of the electronic music scene.

457
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:24,509
Right.

458
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,049
So they'll be able to stay focused.

459
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,470
Oh yeah.

460
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,990
Oh yeah.

461
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,370
Oh yeah.

462
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,292
And even if you can't focus and you're just like, Oh my God, I can't do this.

463
00:23:30,352 --> 00:23:33,173
Like you just, you're smacking the orbs and everything sounds great and you're

464
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:35,355
having a blast and people around you are having a good time.

465
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:36,155
All right.

466
00:23:39,437 --> 00:23:39,577
Hello.

467
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,051
Great talk.

468
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:45,419
I'm curious about the iteration process.

469
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,882
Is there a point where?

470
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:52,840
as the music comes in, the visuals change or vice versa?

471
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,661
Like is there, like how does the synergy work between that

472
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:56,782
and how does the iteration process?

473
00:23:56,982 --> 00:24:00,664
So the visuals themselves, like the visualizers are,

474
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:03,526
were completely dictated by, you know, Gabriel

475
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,328
and the audio itself is completely separated

476
00:24:06,348 --> 00:24:07,348
from that experience, right?

477
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,450
The only thing I can say is the way that they tie

478
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,651
these things together is just through the technology

479
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:13,812
of what they built in their engine.

480
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,474
And then how do we transition from one song to the next

481
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:19,114
and one room to the next is also its own

482
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:20,535
interesting experience.

483
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:21,996
We kind of, they've done an amazing job

484
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:23,736
of being able to merge the worlds together

485
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:24,737
and blend them together.

486
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,638
You're not just loading in and then loading out

487
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:27,358
and then loading in.

488
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:29,339
You actually feel like you're traversing

489
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:30,940
and kind of just ripping through space

490
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,680
and ripping into these zones.

491
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,381
And just the language of it all

492
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,322
just was handled very nicely.

493
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:37,783
I mean, it's kind of, it's one of those things

494
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:40,064
that's so abstract you can't necessarily

495
00:24:40,124 --> 00:24:41,844
describe these things, right?

496
00:24:41,944 --> 00:24:43,125
It's like the game is.

497
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:49,030
The game is a very, very, it's very out there.

498
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,752
It's just like everything about it is just,

499
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:52,514
you can't put, it's hard to put words to.

500
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:54,295
I mean, if you saw half of those visualizers,

501
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:55,597
how would you even begin to describe

502
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:56,758
what you saw really, right?

503
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:58,720
Cool, thanks.

504
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,300
You're welcome.

505
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:05,093
How much time was spent on the concepting stage?

506
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:06,093
Concepting?

507
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:08,655
Oh, that for me is impossible to say.

508
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:09,996
All I can say is when I joined,

509
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,218
because again, I was finishing up raw data,

510
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,120
and as soon as I finished it,

511
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,562
I was moved on to this because it was like,

512
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,703
they needed somebody to help comb

513
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:19,524
and tie these things together,

514
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:21,025
and then just put polish down on it,

515
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,146
and they had already done.

516
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,827
I mean, I could show you all,

517
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,048
even from the visualizers,

518
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,209
I mean, I've dug through everything.

519
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,953
an insane amount of conceptualization went in from the instrumentation to the visualizations.

520
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,956
And then of course when we got to the ship itself, I mean, that was I think one of the

521
00:25:35,996 --> 00:25:36,676
toughest times.

522
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,958
So quite a bit of iteration.

523
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:43,120
I mean, for me to collect all that stuff to display would have been quite a bit, and I

524
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,043
was already feeling, I'm quite surprised how fast I kind of just talked through the whole

525
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,665
thing, but there's just an insane amount of stuff that they did.

526
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:51,506
So it's just...

527
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:55,428
If at some point we'll probably have these these things available online

528
00:25:55,448 --> 00:26:00,130
It would be great for us to collect all of our art and just kind of share it with everybody because you would be shocked

529
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,711
How much has changed was a mostly 2d painting type stuff or like?

530
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,692
Well, it's a combination of the boat, right?

531
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:11,935
It's like start with all the geometric patterns and all these really hard surface shapes these very precise elements have to be you know

532
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:14,896
It's best to do them in 3d and then add everything on top of it

533
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:16,357
Thanks

534
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,853
We good? Everybody cool?

535
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,820
All right, well, thank you very, very, very much.
