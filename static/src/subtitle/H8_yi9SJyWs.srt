1
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,429
We're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,410
Hello and welcome.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,013
This is Tomb Raider Rebooted, audio reimagined.

4
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,174
My name is Jack Grillo.

5
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:15,915
I was the lead sound designer for Tomb Raider.

6
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:18,437
This is Alex Wilmer, music supervisor.

7
00:00:19,738 --> 00:00:21,659
This session is being recorded, so we're

8
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,861
asked to ask you to please silence your cell phones.

9
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:27,863
The talk will be broken up into a few discussions.

10
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:31,706
I will speak about creative direction, voiceover,

11
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:32,386
and sound effects.

12
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:34,288
Alex will speak about music, and then we'll

13
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:35,508
open it up for some questions.

14
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:42,277
I'm going to start off by playing a trailer from the 2012 VGA's.

15
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:46,558
It features our composer Jason Graves conducting a live orchestra.

16
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,056
So much has happened.

17
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:24,218
Our captain is injured.

18
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,539
Have you heard from any of the others?

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,459
Nothing.

20
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,900
Our crew is scattered.

21
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,600
I have a bad feeling about this.

22
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,520
I've got to find them.

23
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:37,417
We're hunted by the island's inhabitants.

24
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:41,622
It's been so long you've walked out.

25
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,547
Sam, listen. I'm going to get you out of there.

26
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,233
You can do it, Laura. After all, you're a Croft.

27
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:22,175
I don't think I'm that kind of Croft.

28
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:23,436
Sure you are.

29
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:29,020
You just don't know it yet.

30
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,549
Alright, let's do this.

31
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:07,235
You can save everyone.

32
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:12,579
There's no other choice. I've got to do this.

33
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,841
If I don't survive...

34
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:24,369
None of us will.

35
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:53,416
Okay, so we're going to start with a bit about ourselves.

36
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:58,218
I've been a sound effects designer for the past 18 years, specializing in games since 2000.

37
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,161
Early in my career I worked as a sound designer for a few of the early Medal of Honor titles

38
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,702
and as lead sound designer for Medal of Honor Allied Assault for PC.

39
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:12,819
I went on to be a consultant for the first Call of Duty game for PC and audio director

40
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,040
for Call of Duty Finest Hour.

41
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,641
I've been with Crystal Dynamics working as lead sound designer for the Tomb Raider series

42
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,361
since the last four years.

43
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:26,082
For Tomb Raider, my responsibilities included defining the creative direction for the audio

44
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:31,224
department, generating sound design elements, voiceover directing and editing, cinematics

45
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:35,785
editing and mixing, assisted with general implementation, and assisted with the overall

46
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:35,945
mix.

47
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:42,763
Yeah, and I've been in the industry for about eight years.

48
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,247
For four years I was working at a company called Berklee Sound Artists,

49
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:55,412
where it's an audio post-production facility that mainly worked on documentary films and independent features.

50
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,754
But there I was the director of video game audio,

51
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:02,836
which is a title that I gave myself to sound fancy in the video game industry,

52
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,357
which didn't work very well.

53
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:10,859
And at Crystal, my first project was Guardian of Light,

54
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,302
and then on Tomb Raider I was the music supervisor for that.

55
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:20,424
But we were a small team of four people.

56
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,545
The other two are right there.

57
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,150
And we all had to do a little bit of everything,

58
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,811
but that was my main role.

59
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:37,657
So as the title of this discussion states,

60
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,378
the recent Tomb Raider was a reboot.

61
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:42,180
It was officially the ninth Tomb Raider title,

62
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:45,723
but because it was the Lara Croft origin story,

63
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:48,846
we had the amazing opportunity to create a new spin

64
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,708
on the iconic Tomb Raider and Lara Croft brands.

65
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,092
Production on Tomb Raider was the best of both worlds in terms of development models.

66
00:05:56,192 --> 00:06:01,174
It was a cross between the name recognition of an industry household name and a brand new IP.

67
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:06,035
We had the unique opportunity as a team to look carefully at each aspect of the franchise,

68
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:10,057
celebrate the conventions we wanted to keep, redefine parts we wanted to change,

69
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:14,119
and to create from scratch new design elements and gameplay conventions.

70
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,160
The Tomb Raider brand has been around for 18 years,

71
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,681
and along with the natural cycles of development turnover,

72
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:23,349
comes plenty of new blood.

73
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,151
For audio and related disciplines,

74
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,992
new people filled several key positions,

75
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,674
including game director, lead sound designer,

76
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:33,237
music supervisor, composer, story and cinematics writer,

77
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:36,560
a narrative designer, and of course, our Lara Croft.

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,022
This infusion of new blood was a shortcut

79
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,044
to new ideas and fresh perspectives.

80
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:44,045
At every turn, we're all challenged

81
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,047
to bring our own creative voices to the franchise

82
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:47,668
to help bring new life to the series.

83
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,691
And again, as an expression

84
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,972
of the best of both worlds concept.

85
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:54,737
Many of the other key positions in the audio chain

86
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:55,958
were held by Tomb Raider veterans,

87
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:58,740
including the creative director, game director,

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,362
senior audio engineer, and cinematics director.

89
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:05,125
This overall combination of talent created an ideal setting

90
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,847
for creative collaboration and execution.

91
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:15,213
As I stated in the introduction,

92
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,074
one of my responsibilities was to define

93
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:18,856
the creative direction for the audio department.

94
00:07:19,476 --> 00:07:20,737
And to be perfectly honest,

95
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,172
I find that a standalone creative direction for sound is more academic than practical.

96
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:31,055
Audio is often a supportive discipline, and because our work must blend with all other

97
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:36,598
disciplines, from animation, visual effects, background art, and UI, to core gameplay design

98
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:40,541
and the emotional arc of the narrative, I find that audio behaves as a kind of glue,

99
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,182
an essential ingredient that ties everything else together.

100
00:07:44,223 --> 00:07:47,825
For a game like Tomb Raider, I believe the role of audio, at its best, is to help bring

101
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:48,685
emotion to the narrative.

102
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:51,565
excitement to the game play, and clarity to the controls.

103
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,587
So instead of defining a standalone creative direction

104
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,868
for sound, I find that it's much more productive

105
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:59,009
to study the themes of the game as a whole,

106
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:02,231
and from that exercise, identify the key pillars,

107
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,772
or anchors, to focus on throughout the project.

108
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,615
Tomb Raider is a story of how Lara Croft,

109
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:12,396
a young, ambitious, and often naive archeologist,

110
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:14,637
becomes stranded on a mysterious island,

111
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,078
struggles against harsh environmental conditions,

112
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:18,339
and hostile local forces.

113
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:23,052
Takes on the responsibility of the death of her crew and several of her closest friends.

114
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:28,036
Witnesses the corruption and greed of supranational powers.

115
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:32,480
And ascends from the experience an elite survivalist and battle-tested hero.

116
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,764
The brand campaign for Tomb Raider focused primarily on survival as the central theme.

117
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,146
And while this concept was important to us throughout development,

118
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,069
I didn't feel I could use it as an anchor to help with the sound design.

119
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:47,332
But I did find that if we took the concept of Lara's character arc as an anchor...

120
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,455
From naive and vulnerable to unsure,

121
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:52,356
all the way to confident and deadly,

122
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,417
we now had something solid to use

123
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,098
to guide us through our sound design choices.

124
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:01,360
I want to step back for a moment and say

125
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,341
that using a character arc as a sound design anchor

126
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:04,941
was new for me.

127
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,062
In my past experience as a first person shooter developer,

128
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:10,243
I always used to consider the player's weapon

129
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:11,724
as the primary anchor.

130
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:14,405
This focus would drive most of my creative

131
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:16,546
and logistical decisions, ranging from field recordings,

132
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:18,273
all the way to the final mix.

133
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,474
But for Tomb Raider, we had to think more broadly

134
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,834
and ultimately found that using Lara as our anchor

135
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,815
would yield the most exciting and dynamic mix.

136
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:29,196
And it would allow us to most directly support

137
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,817
the overall creative goals for the game.

138
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:34,078
So what does it mean to say that Lara Croft

139
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,558
is the sound design anchor for Tomb Raider?

140
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:38,259
Well, generally it means that the primary decisions

141
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,880
for creating, organizing, implementing, and mixing

142
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,821
must take into account the actions, emotions,

143
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,402
and evolution of our lead character.

144
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,765
This obviously includes voiceover direction,

145
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,306
but it also extends to creating a proper mix

146
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,927
for Lara's basic traversal and movement,

147
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:56,448
dynamic sound design for combat and weaponry,

148
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,649
and of course a musical score that focuses first

149
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,710
and foremost on Lara's emotional state,

150
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,651
as opposed to the setting or action.

151
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,553
Alex will get into greater detail

152
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,894
about how we executed an emotional score,

153
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,075
so I'll simply introduce the idea here.

154
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:15,036
The music was directed to play out through the eyes of Lara,

155
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,877
not as a backdrop of the island or its inhabitants.

156
00:10:18,945 --> 00:10:21,827
We used themes and instrumentation to represent these elements of the game,

157
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:27,512
but they were always done as if they were filtered through Lara's experience first.

158
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:36,158
Understanding the themes and settling on an anchor is the first step towards executing a creative direction.

159
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:41,202
The next step is to match the sound design style with the tones and the narrative of the art direction.

160
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,264
Tomb Raider has a serious narrative tone.

161
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,085
Characters and events are all grounded

162
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,026
with a sense of realism.

163
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,288
And although the premise of the conflict

164
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,609
has supernatural overtones,

165
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,691
we push those aspects of the story

166
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:55,832
through a filter of realism.

167
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,874
The art direction follows the narrative tone

168
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,976
with realistic character proportions,

169
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:01,897
realistic environments,

170
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,858
and puzzles based on simple physics

171
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:04,839
as opposed to magic.

172
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,262
All of this is easily pointed to a sound design style

173
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,584
that can be described as realistic or authentic.

174
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,600
We worked hard to make the world feel alive and real,

175
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,561
so that the player can more directly feel connected

176
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:17,802
to the characters and the events.

177
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:20,583
The game itself has many over-the-top sequences,

178
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,884
which we designed and mixed with excitement in mind,

179
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:24,805
yet the overall tone of the sound design

180
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,025
was intentionally realistic.

181
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,647
I'm gonna show a video here which focuses on

182
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:35,829
how we worked on the small details and a push for realism.

183
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:58,878
A lifeboat. Where are they? They must have gone inland.

184
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,148
Okay, take it slow.

185
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:50,450
The most obvious way for audio production to support Lara's character arc is through the voiceover.

186
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,793
This of course isn't fully in the control of the audio team to execute.

187
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:58,255
It starts from the narrative arc and writing, which drive the cinematics.

188
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:03,939
But from there, we can use the content and the cinematics to direct the performance of the surrounding voiceover content.

189
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:11,123
We use Lara's character arc to ensure that all of the in-game voiceover and vocalizations match the specific part of her journey.

190
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:16,687
In Tomb Raider, there are very few systemic or core voiceover hints.

191
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:21,912
Rather, the moments of gameplay that required hints were written and recorded with those unique settings in mind.

192
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:27,256
Early on in production, we recorded a large batch of generic reactions, hints, and motivations,

193
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:30,659
intended to be used as needed throughout production.

194
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:37,545
But these lines were abandoned along the way because they never quite matched what Lara was going through in any given moment.

195
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:42,637
As the game starts, for example, Lara needs to convince herself that she's capable of making a big jump,

196
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:46,719
or that she can stomach skinning a deer, or that she can bring herself to kill another human being.

197
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,581
Toward the middle of the game, these hints and motivations become more subtle,

198
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,702
and by the end, they're totally unnecessary.

199
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:58,085
And in development, even if we chose to include a hint or motivation with the same exact wording

200
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:02,387
as in a different part of the game, we would record unique performances of each of these moments

201
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,208
to best match her current state of mind.

202
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:08,284
Lara's vocalizations, her breathing and effort sounds,

203
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:10,645
were most often matched to her animations,

204
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:13,027
which were shared files reused throughout the game.

205
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,849
Because of this, we didn't have the technical mechanism

206
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,770
to change these sounds as the game progresses.

207
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,533
Instead, Karl Gallagher, our senior audio engineer,

208
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:24,855
set up the system to be driven from her health,

209
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,937
which created a micro character arc.

210
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:30,739
At full health, Lara's basic movement animations

211
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,420
were supported with subtle breathing sounds.

212
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:37,047
When she becomes injured, these same animations are supported by more labored breathing and

213
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,287
struggling effort performances.

214
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:44,129
On top of this, many of the set piece action spikes of the game featured unique jumping,

215
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:45,570
landing, or climbing events.

216
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,871
For these sequences, we made sure to add vocalizations that best matched that state of her journey,

217
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,512
from scared and vulnerable at the beginning to confident and deadly at the end.

218
00:14:54,532 --> 00:15:00,194
I'm going to show another video which demonstrates Lara's state of mind early in the game, where

219
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:01,214
she's scared and cold.

220
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,128
What we did is the first part of it has an in-game movement,

221
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:12,595
and we overrode her standard breathing with trembling and panic sounds

222
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,958
that then leads directly into the cinematic.

223
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:53,338
Looks abandoned.

224
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,319
Is anyone listening? Please respond!

225
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:11,839
Next I'll show a video of Lara where she's a bit more confident in the middle of the game.

226
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:16,221
She's still exhausted and battle-weary, but you'll see a bit of the progression of her character.

227
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:57,990
I'd like to switch gears now and talk a bit about one of our other sound design challenges,

228
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,710
the weapons.

229
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,991
The combat system for Tomb Raider was a dramatic overhaul from previous titles.

230
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,892
Combat became a strong stand-alone component of the game.

231
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,880
and provided a series of pacing spikes for the player.

232
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,202
One of my general creative goals with weapon sound design

233
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:14,624
is to make them feel authentic, powerful,

234
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:15,745
and satisfying to fire.

235
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,746
Basically, I want the player to have fun with them.

236
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,389
I want them to enjoy the feel of each weapon

237
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:22,610
so much so that they lose track of their ammo

238
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,471
just to open fire.

239
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:30,336
For me, the approach I like to start with with my design

240
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:33,158
is from all the secondary actions.

241
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:38,557
Bullet impacts, ricochets, shells ejecting and hitting the ground, reload events, and

242
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:41,259
the various handling and movement actions tend to come first.

243
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,622
This process allows me to have a solid context for designing and mixing the explosive fire

244
00:17:46,662 --> 00:17:47,383
sounds on top of it.

245
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:53,667
I also like to break the implementation into several layers with limited or even zero variety

246
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:54,127
per layer.

247
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:59,310
I might have five sounds, five different sounds overlapping for any given weapon fire.

248
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:02,931
And I like to focus my attention on how these elements mix together in game,

249
00:18:03,171 --> 00:18:06,374
rather than focusing on creating a large array of asset variation.

250
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:09,837
Most other sound categories need extensive asset variation,

251
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,779
but I find that weapon sound design requires focus.

252
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,164
I think this approach gives the weapons a more direct sound and sense of purpose.

253
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:23,668
I'm going to show a quick video of a variety of our weapons in a combat scenario.

254
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:07,982
So as a first person shooter veteran, I felt that I'd be quite at home with the combat

255
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:08,762
and weaponry sounds.

256
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:13,006
But I found the biggest challenge was Lara's star weapon, the bow.

257
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:16,414
Lara's bow can be used during combat, hunting,

258
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:18,015
puzzle solving, and for traversal.

259
00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:20,817
This range of use made designing and mixing it

260
00:19:20,837 --> 00:19:23,539
sounds rather complicated, as it had to sound consistent,

261
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,501
yet appropriate in all these contexts.

262
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,243
Another complicating factor was the fact

263
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,244
that realistic bow and arrow performances

264
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:32,006
aren't typically loud or explosive,

265
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,788
yet we wanted to give the player satisfying sound feedback

266
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,670
during both stealth and explosive combat scenarios.

267
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,673
All told, the bow went through countless iteration passes.

268
00:19:42,772 --> 00:19:47,535
It was probably the first sound design task I had when I joined the team.

269
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:52,518
And it was such an important element to the overall sound design that we tweaked the sounds

270
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,138
and mix of the bow throughout development.

271
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:58,021
And to be honest, the only end point for working on it was shipping the game.

272
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,563
Ultimately, the bow is made up of a handful of simple sounds.

273
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:06,586
One realistic bow firing sound mixed with a few overlapping sounds of flapping rubber

274
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,967
tubing along with a low end thump sweetener.

275
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:10,548
These same elements.

276
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:16,773
are used for all the bow in all its contexts and even for all bow upgrades, which I feel

277
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:20,694
gives the bow a strong center and provides familiar feedback throughout its use.

278
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:27,236
And here's a video showing off the bow used in combat and then as a traversal device.

279
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:07,657
Now another strong feature of the overall sound design mix for Tomb Raider is the ambient

280
00:21:07,677 --> 00:21:09,279
sounds, or more specifically the weather.

281
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,484
In our story, the island of Yamatai is home to the Japanese Sun Queen who can control

282
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:19,268
the weather, using the rain, wind, or lightning to her advantage, or as an expression of her

283
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:20,169
anger or fear.

284
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,593
With this in mind, we wanted to make use of the natural dynamics of weather sounds to

285
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,255
give the island character and purpose.

286
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:28,897
Heavy rain and wind events exist throughout the game.

287
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:34,015
along with a couple of snowstorms and an array of waterfalls, rivers, streams, and the surrounding ocean.

288
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:39,719
I used to joke with the team that the ambient sounds for Tomb Raider was a greatest hits compilation of white noise.

289
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,564
These weather events created difficult mix challenges for us as we needed to support the environment with a powerful, often over-the-top mix

290
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:52,808
in order to match the creative direction, yet we still needed to carve out space in the mix for Lara.

291
00:21:54,358 --> 00:22:00,199
The technique we use to implement ambient sounds is based on designing a large number of stand-alone sounds for each weather category.

292
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:07,801
Individually placing these sounds in each level, and allowing the combinations of these sounds in-game to create unique sounding environments.

293
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,422
There are no scene or level-based ambient mixes in Tomb Raider.

294
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,282
This gave us the added flexibility to tune every corner of every level.

295
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:20,304
And it allowed us to control the mix of the various categories to suit the needs of the narrative or gameplay.

296
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,304
For example, in our mixing system,

297
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:24,799
We could use Lara's voiceover or weapon sounds

298
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,560
to dynamically duck the volume of individual elements

299
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,402
of the ambience, or if necessary, the entire ambience.

300
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,423
Other benefits of this technique are added movement

301
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,444
and spatial presence for the ambient sounds.

302
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:38,105
And because our cinematics playback engine

303
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:39,866
used the live ambiences in game,

304
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:42,347
transitions between cinematics and gameplay

305
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,407
is smooth and dynamic.

306
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:46,629
One more note about the ambient sounds for Tomb Raider.

307
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:48,970
One of the benefits of drawing special attention

308
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,550
to the weather events on the island

309
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,291
left us with the opportunity to relish.

310
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:53,946
in the more subtle environments.

311
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,148
Some of my favorite locations in the game

312
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:57,449
are the quiet forested areas,

313
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,611
where the player learns basic traversal mechanics

314
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:01,232
or how to use the bow for hunting.

315
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:03,394
These are the areas of the game

316
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,655
that I feel are truly immersive

317
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:06,576
and provide much needed pacing break

318
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,518
from the action spikes that surround them.

319
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,720
And I'm gonna show another video here

320
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,943
that shows off some of our dynamics with the ambience.

321
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:57,122
This video shows off also some of the variety of implementation techniques that we used.

322
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:01,326
The sounds were attached to individual birds and the entire bird flock.

323
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:06,551
Wind, background ocean sounds were often white noise sounds,

324
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:11,496
and then the individual ocean waves all combining together to make the overall soundscape.

325
00:24:12,857 --> 00:24:15,860
I'm going to pass this on over to Alex to now speak about music.

326
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:36,911
So, for Tomb Raider I had, I think, quite lofty goals for the music.

327
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:43,198
Just to give you some background, I used to come to the GDC in, you know,

328
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:51,242
Eight years ago or so, I started coming and I would talk to developers here and at the

329
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:57,325
time I had a lot of opinions about music in video games and I always felt like there was

330
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:03,428
maybe a disconnect between composers and the people actually implementing the music, that

331
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:09,711
those weren't the same person. And I felt like there was more emphasis put on making

332
00:25:09,731 --> 00:25:11,992
the music make sense as opposed to...

333
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:15,274
scoring the emotional content.

334
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:19,117
Does that make sense?

335
00:25:19,177 --> 00:25:21,438
So, when I took on the responsibility on Simulator,

336
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:23,900
these were the goals that I had to truly score,

337
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,882
create a truly scored experience,

338
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:28,102
score the emotion,

339
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:30,724
score the character arc of Lara,

340
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:32,405
create a unique identity.

341
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:36,872
I have highly dynamic music and never hearing the same piece of music twice.

342
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:40,774
I think for a lot of people working in video games,

343
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:42,976
we know that those are quite lofty goals.

344
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:46,618
But with the exception of highly dynamic music,

345
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:50,921
if you took that list and went to a film director as a composer

346
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:52,882
and said, I want to do these things in your movie,

347
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,743
you'd kind of get laughed out of the room.

348
00:25:56,168 --> 00:26:00,289
So it's a big deal for video games,

349
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,251
and the reason why is to immerse, hypnotize,

350
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:07,932
suspend disbelief, captivate, whatever that idea is.

351
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:10,773
Because I think it comes from a part of the brain

352
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:12,733
that isn't really associated with language.

353
00:26:12,773 --> 00:26:16,515
It's something that draws focus and you lose track of time.

354
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:17,095
That kind of thing.

355
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,968
In order to achieve something like that, you need to plan it really, really well.

356
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:28,531
And the way that we started was with the core themes.

357
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:34,074
Jason Graves, who's our composer, is very seasoned at this kind of work.

358
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:38,817
And when we started working on the themes, he delivered them first on piano.

359
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:41,338
And this is Lara's theme that he delivered.

360
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:59,350
And so we iterated on that for a while to work out the theme.

361
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,791
But we only did it on piano, so you could just focus on what were the notes.

362
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:11,353
Just for some sense of how we were establishing dynamics early on,

363
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,753
this is the island theme.

364
00:27:15,354 --> 00:27:17,294
And this one's a little bit more dissonant.

365
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:29,178
So, once we established our themes, we started working on the overture.

366
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:35,402
And, to me, this was a sort of first for our industry.

367
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:38,885
I'm not sure. There may be people who have done it before, but I'd never heard of it.

368
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:48,037
We created basically an 8 minute piece of music that was essentially a guide for the rest of the score.

369
00:27:49,437 --> 00:28:02,242
And how this was built was by taking the story of the game, going through the story, all the major beats of the game, all the major character development moments.

370
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:09,408
And then showing Jason the concept art for the game and doing that.

371
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:15,015
The benefit in creating this piece of music, the benefit of doing this was that you front load your iteration.

372
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:23,238
So we could show this piece of music to our creative leads

373
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:28,679
and iterate in a time when there isn't a lot of game built yet,

374
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,940
so that you can't actually put music in the game anyway.

375
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,941
But it allows you to get past the iteration point.

376
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:41,142
So once you actually start creating the in-game assets,

377
00:28:41,802 --> 00:28:44,363
there's very little iteration at that point.

378
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:58,165
The next thing we did was steal an idea that Jason and I both worked on a game called Blacksite Area 51.

379
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:08,413
What they did was they created suites of music and in order to basically populate their game with as much music as they could with as few minutes as possible,

380
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:13,197
they created these suites which were highly dense pieces of music.

381
00:29:13,237 --> 00:29:15,239
This is an example of what a suite looks like.

382
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,623
Just for contrast, this is what scored cinematics look like.

383
00:29:21,064 --> 00:29:26,228
So you can see that you would get a lot of tracks to work with.

384
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:32,133
And then what I would do is I would take these tracks and then create different mixes.

385
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:38,398
So out of two minutes worth of music, I could get maybe 10 or 15 minutes worth of music for the game.

386
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:44,062
Jason would always deliver a mixed version that would...

387
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:47,503
where I could listen to it and make sense of the piece.

388
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:49,590
So in this case, it sounds like this.

389
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:05,188
But there's so many elements in this piece of music that if I was to listen to all the stems at one time, it would just come out as noise.

390
00:30:05,789 --> 00:30:07,490
So that was useful for that.

391
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:14,614
The way that I could use these stems is obviously create something that almost sounds like a scored moment.

392
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:17,496
So this is an example of something like that.

393
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:43,323
And then the other way is to create small loops where you can do sequential scoring or layered scoring, and these are a couple of examples of that.

394
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:04,515
So when you design it that way and you don't come at it from an angle of trying to reuse cinematics,

395
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:08,858
you come at it from the angle of, I'm going to reorganize your stems,

396
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:18,705
you end up with a very large amount of music that you can lay down a bass layer.

397
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:22,748
Because, like one of the goals was at the beginning,

398
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,830
that I wanted to have unique music throughout the game.

399
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,903
So, to give you a sense of these suites,

400
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:38,808
this is a traversal suite from early on in the game.

401
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:43,431
Generally how we worked was we would refer to the overture

402
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:49,796
and we would have Jason withdraw from that.

403
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:58,486
The traversal suite was, in this case, all the traversal suites were at the same tempo.

404
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:07,437
And so you can see that if all the pink post-its are the different traversal suites throughout the game...

405
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:12,839
And if, for example, I needed traversal music in between a post-it,

406
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:20,421
I could combine elements from different suites because they're all in the same tempo.

407
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:24,162
By the way, in the background, this is a color script that I had in my wall,

408
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:27,102
which the art department uses to...

409
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,667
It uses to guide their palettes for the levels, but they're usually based on...

410
00:32:33,747 --> 00:32:38,936
I mean, they're based on the story and the emotion that is trying to be conveyed in a certain level.

411
00:32:39,316 --> 00:32:40,919
So it's very useful to use for music, too.

412
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:46,379
This is a sweep from later on in the game.

413
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:54,142
This is representing more of the scavengers who are the first major enemy that you face.

414
00:32:54,222 --> 00:33:02,947
And so, Mars' perspective on them is that they're chaotic and you can hear some of those sort of bound sounds coming through in this.

415
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:04,947
So, the next one...

416
00:33:16,138 --> 00:33:21,282
This piece represents the Oni towards the end of the game.

417
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:25,966
It's from a section of the game where they're the major enemy.

418
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:29,289
And they have a much more deliberate...

419
00:33:42,214 --> 00:33:48,256
So to give you a sense of scoring traversal, the way that the process worked was that we

420
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:56,219
would first of all create these loops out of the suites to lay down the base layer.

421
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:00,600
And this is an example of one of those.

422
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:11,036
So this is very early on in the game, and so we're building our orchestra with Lara's character as she kind of grows.

423
00:34:14,597 --> 00:34:17,237
So you can tell it's all sort of individual instruments.

424
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:21,158
The next is a flute style.

425
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:28,040
And that came from the suite.

426
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:33,570
So we're creating very granular elements of music

427
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,053
to do the scoring here.

428
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:55,219
When there was a sequence that was too difficult to score using suites, I would send a video capture to Jason, and then he would score that specifically.

429
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:00,404
And I'd send him what came before and what comes after so he could join them.

430
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:09,151
So I'm going to show you video now of the video that Jack showed earlier, but with music and talk a little bit over it.

431
00:35:22,984 --> 00:35:26,146
The lifeboat, where are they?

432
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:27,907
They must have gone inland.

433
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:34,272
So we have a flute stinger here that is two notes, one rising above the other.

434
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:38,556
It creates an optimistic feeling when you see that lifeboat, that maybe your friends are alive.

435
00:35:41,318 --> 00:35:43,559
Okay, take it slow.

436
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,444
As Lara approaches this log, I bring in a high-pitched tone.

437
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:12,743
And then I hide the end of the tone under the stinger for when she slips, because the tension moment is...

438
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:19,448
We have this driving percussion pushing the player forward.

439
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:24,871
And another flute stinger. And this flute stinger was just a single note, so it's a little bit more trepidatious, but it reminds you...

440
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,393
keeps you... keeps your friends in your mind.

441
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:45,134
So now I take away all the music, and that's a technique to make the player feel uncomfortable

442
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:45,955
or uneasy.

443
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:05,557
Listen to the volume of the strings as Lara gets to the edge of the wing.

444
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:18,748
And there's another flute stinger, this time two notes descending.

445
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:42,205
So what I was trying to say with the flute stingers

446
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:45,688
was that by that moment in the game,

447
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:48,850
you realize this place is a pretty dangerous environment

448
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,912
for Lara, and you're hinting at the sense

449
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:55,214
that maybe your friends are dead.

450
00:37:56,675 --> 00:38:01,818
And so essentially, every piece of music that's in the game

451
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:06,422
has a purpose, whether or not it is conveyed in that way

452
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:07,823
or received in that right way.

453
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,670
As a note to the volume of the violins going up as Laura gets across the wing,

454
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:21,495
what we're trying to do there is really anticipate what the player is doing.

455
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,081
And as much as we can do that in the game,

456
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:29,646
I tried to do that.

457
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:35,312
This is an example of, at this point in the game,

458
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:38,476
Laura has opened many doors with her climbing axe.

459
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,480
It's a mechanic where you mash the X button.

460
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,063
But it's a mechanic that you can break out of.

461
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:50,587
At this point though, this door divides two major sections of the game.

462
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:55,050
The first section, percussion is used as a major element in the score.

463
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:59,353
After the door, brass becomes the main element.

464
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:05,017
And so I make an assumption here that the player is going to, you know,

465
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:09,740
button mash their way through this door and not stop.

466
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:13,676
But as soon as the player makes contact with the door,

467
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:17,942
I anticipate the music that follows.

468
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:21,747
And so I'll play this for you so you get a sense of what that sounds like.

469
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:53,315
So, every time you try to anticipate what the player is going to do, you also have to

470
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,477
take into account what happens when they don't do what you want them to do.

471
00:39:57,177 --> 00:40:01,080
So, in this video I'll show you what happens if the player doesn't actually open the door.

472
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:37,976
Thanks for watching!

473
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:59,484
So in scoring combat, I use a number of techniques.

474
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:03,325
I'm going to show you some examples of some of the most basic techniques.

475
00:41:03,345 --> 00:41:04,945
This is the layer technique.

476
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,686
So we have a low intensity loop.

477
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:15,428
So light combat and then a heavy combat.

478
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:26,468
So when Lara is firing her weapon, we transition into the heavy combat.

479
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:31,891
And when she's in cover, basically when she's not firing her weapon,

480
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:35,433
we're just going to play the low intensity loop.

481
00:41:48,645 --> 00:41:52,559
We'll say he lost it, jumped to his death, but you shot him.

482
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:27,836
So that's a pretty simple example of that implementation.

483
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:30,018
The next is sequential.

484
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,720
And that's similar to the traversal that we did before.

485
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:39,024
And here's some of the elements of that.

486
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:44,108
Free combat stinger.

487
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:49,872
This is a stealth stinger if you kill the guy in the middle

488
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:51,013
without the other guys noticing.

489
00:42:56,797 --> 00:42:57,978
That's one of the combat loops.

490
00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:03,527
So just also listen for when Lara jumps the gap in the video.

491
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:06,611
It goes from one combat loop to the other.

492
00:43:06,672 --> 00:43:11,018
And a stinger kind of helps blend that transition.

493
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:42,414
If you show up to the ceremony, Tom, Father Matthias will cut a joint.

494
00:43:42,714 --> 00:43:46,875
I can hold my liquor, as long as you hold your tongue.

495
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:49,775
I heard they picked up some women in the round-up.

496
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,196
Yeah, Matthias chose one for the test.

497
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:57,637
Well, maybe she's the one. We might finally get off this rock.

498
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:03,798
Don't get excited, it always ends the same way. Some poor girl burns, then it's business.

499
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,352
So those two techniques are very, very simple techniques.

500
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:41,255
But what's interesting about how the implementation was

501
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:45,417
done in Tomb Raider was that every single sequence

502
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,999
or combat setup was uniquely scored.

503
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:51,640
So you never get used to the systems.

504
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,021
And you can use very, very simple systems like that,

505
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:59,344
and the player will never recognize what exactly

506
00:44:59,404 --> 00:45:00,325
is controlling the music.

507
00:45:02,206 --> 00:45:02,546
Hopefully.

508
00:45:04,688 --> 00:45:07,750
Most of the setups usually employ both of those techniques,

509
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,613
having layered stuff and also being sequential.

510
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:15,395
In this example, also, we're anticipating

511
00:45:15,415 --> 00:45:16,056
what's going to happen.

512
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:19,338
And so there's a high frequency tone

513
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:22,220
when Lara's standing at the wall.

514
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,662
So the player has the opportunity

515
00:45:24,702 --> 00:45:26,203
to not engage in combat.

516
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,484
So I'll play you what happens there.

517
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:30,867
This is the good stuff.

518
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:35,285
If you show up to the ceremony drunk, Father Matthias will cut you in the throat.

519
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:38,046
I can hold my liquor, as long as you hold your tongue.

520
00:45:38,066 --> 00:45:40,027
I heard they picked up some women in the roundup.

521
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:40,247
Yeah.

522
00:45:40,267 --> 00:45:42,528
Matthias turned one for the test.

523
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:43,508
Get excited, it always ends the same way.

524
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:56,813
Some poor girl burns, none of the business as usual.

525
00:46:01,623 --> 00:46:04,964
Man, I am sick of this damn place. I just want...

526
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:26,590
Because of the art style and just because of how the music was getting into the game,

527
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,772
it felt like we really needed to create unique sounds.

528
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:36,995
So I asked Jason to maybe put in some chain link fence noises and things like that,

529
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:37,875
and he came up with this.

530
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:42,378
which was basically chicken wire. He owns chickens.

531
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:50,403
And then he took a dustbin lid to create a plate, a resonating plate.

532
00:46:52,764 --> 00:46:55,246
And then basically started bowing it. So this is what that sounded like.

533
00:47:02,747 --> 00:47:03,668
So that was pretty cool.

534
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:10,034
But the next thing he did was he found a sculptor that

535
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,696
lived down the road from him.

536
00:47:12,437 --> 00:47:15,340
And he basically went into his workshop

537
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,983
and started finding all these kinds of interesting elements

538
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:21,686
that he could make interesting sounds out of.

539
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:26,010
This is a bucket that they welded some rods onto.

540
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,474
And they started creating, out of metal pipes,

541
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:33,437
they started creating these kind of chimes.

542
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:40,582
And then welding a bunch of metal so you could rattle.

543
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:42,804
This was made to look like bamboo,

544
00:47:42,824 --> 00:47:44,486
because it was all sort of inspired

545
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:45,627
by the art of the game.

546
00:47:46,868 --> 00:47:48,189
And because this guy's a sculptor,

547
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:49,810
he ended up putting them all together

548
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,451
like this, which just kind of blows my mind.

549
00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:53,332
The...

550
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:54,993
The...

551
00:47:55,614 --> 00:47:56,574
It's even got a bow.

552
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:59,437
Like, an actual bow.

553
00:47:59,457 --> 00:48:08,865
This is what the chimes sound like, and then the bowls.

554
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:16,176
And those are really good elements for the Oni.

555
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:20,921
They sound very established sounds, very confident,

556
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:26,926
and worked well for the ancient inhabitants of the island.

557
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:32,478
Then the vessel, as they called it, worked really well for the scavengers,

558
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:36,480
because it was an extremely primitive sounding,

559
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:45,705
and worked well for that kind of culture.

560
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,366
So just for some scale, this is how big this thing is. It's huge.

561
00:48:52,104 --> 00:48:57,290
I'm going to show you a video, this is of the opening level of the game, just to give

562
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:03,637
you a sense of how the instrument was used to create a soundscape rather than music,

563
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:09,884
but really sort of support the emotion of what's happening in this situation.

564
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:01,712
Help!

565
00:50:01,772 --> 00:50:02,493
Jonah!

566
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,355
Ryan!

567
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:05,575
Help!

568
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:06,776
I can't die like this.

569
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,011
Got to get down.

570
00:50:35,438 --> 00:50:37,601
But this... it was gonna hurt.

571
00:50:58,052 --> 00:50:58,232
Oh

572
00:50:58,413 --> 00:50:59,733
Oh

573
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:22,363
So it was really important to me personally that the music in that section of the game

574
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:26,924
really alienate the player and support the idea of a reboot.

575
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:29,225
That we're redefining what Lara is.

576
00:51:29,265 --> 00:51:34,226
And so with the music, you're making a very, very bold statement

577
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:40,527
and you're almost pushing the player away and saying, you know, this game is not for you.

578
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:43,027
To give you a sense of...

579
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:48,396
Also the dynamic range of this instrument.

580
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:53,339
This run-out section, you solve a puzzle and it starts a cave-in.

581
00:51:57,082 --> 00:52:01,525
As you escape, you'll hear that the music is highly percussive.

582
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:05,568
We had to add some elements to it, like brass and some bigger drums

583
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:07,549
because of the limited palette of the instrument.

584
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:09,630
But it's really the key focus.

585
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:14,515
Back to what I was saying about pushing the player away.

586
00:52:15,576 --> 00:52:19,560
What I'm trying to do is create a dynamic between this

587
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,082
and eventually playing Lara's theme for the first time.

588
00:52:22,562 --> 00:52:24,965
When you escape, we play Lara's theme.

589
00:52:25,705 --> 00:52:26,046
And so.

590
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,962
What I really wanted the effect of that to be was to draw the player in.

591
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:33,542
You're constantly pushing them away.

592
00:52:33,602 --> 00:52:36,043
It's the first, you know, maybe 20 minutes of the game.

593
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,304
So hopefully they'll continue playing up until this point,

594
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:40,165
because they just bought it.

595
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:42,606
But when...

596
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,807
So, you know, because they need to experience this moment.

597
00:52:46,347 --> 00:52:51,489
But when they get out there and we play the theme, we play it on a piano.

598
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:57,116
And so you go from an instrument that is highly alien to a lot of people,

599
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,159
it's completely unique, they've never heard it before,

600
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:03,545
to an instrument that a lot of people have a very personal experience with.

601
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,971
And that dynamic is what I hope kind of grabs you for the rest of the game.

602
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:09,233
So let's take a listen to that.

603
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:03,626
Ohh!

604
00:55:03,646 --> 00:55:05,447
Is she crying for his friend?

605
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:05,707
I guess.

606
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,168
She'll show up before time runs out.

607
00:55:07,628 --> 00:55:09,569
You should take her to a hospital.

608
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:10,570
Fine, she'll be fine.

609
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:11,770
I must confess, I don't blame her.

610
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:12,551
Who blamed her?

611
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:14,212
They are nobody.

612
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:18,114
You should be nice to her,

613
00:55:18,134 --> 00:55:18,554
She is my friend.

614
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:21,756
She deserves a little love and grief.

615
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:24,417
We spent hands on our wrists when we were little,

616
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:27,779
We can't forgive her for what happened to us!

617
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:28,740
Because she愛s us.

618
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,601
We can't even sleep with her.

619
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:52,362
So, thanks very much.

620
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,885
I think we have about four minutes left for questions.

621
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:56,446
We kind of cut that really close, sorry.

622
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,810
And if you have questions, if you come up to the mic,

623
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:01,632
they're recording it.

624
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:07,037
Yes, so one of the problems with, potential problems with having combat music is that,

625
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:11,562
you know, the player can use that as kind of a bad guy radar to kind of, you know, know

626
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:13,925
when guys are around or when they've been spotted.

627
00:56:14,846 --> 00:56:18,770
What are some techniques that you use to kind of prevent, you know, to kind of keep the,

628
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:22,395
maintain the sense of constant danger in the world?

629
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,043
Yeah, I think if you do it the way that we were doing it,

630
00:56:28,484 --> 00:56:33,607
where you consider each section of combat differently,

631
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:39,772
and you don't rely on systems or template systems,

632
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:45,416
you avoid situations like that because while you're

633
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:47,737
playing through, you experience them happening.

634
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:51,620
And you're like, oh, we're telegraphing to the player

635
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:55,622
That combat's about to happen or whatever.

636
00:56:56,463 --> 00:56:59,304
And so you avoid that because you're hand-crafting everything.

637
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:00,864
Okay.

638
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,886
So that's kind of the...

639
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:06,567
That's also the reason why you do it.

640
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:08,027
But...

641
00:57:08,047 --> 00:57:10,769
Yeah, it basically took a ton of iteration.

642
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,649
And we were conscious of it as we were going through.

643
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:14,790
That very problem.

644
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,091
We didn't want to telegraph too much.

645
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:17,632
We wanted to keep it fresh for the player.

646
00:57:19,766 --> 00:57:24,851
And having that process of going over and over again and going from one sequence to

647
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:26,552
the next kind of forced it out of us.

648
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:31,998
So to kind of keep the player surprised by, you know, maybe this is how it usually works,

649
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:33,999
but then sometimes it doesn't work like that.

650
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:39,485
Yeah, and experiencing like one thing to the next, like whenever you're working on a section

651
00:57:39,525 --> 00:57:40,966
it's really, it's, it's...

652
00:57:41,607 --> 00:57:48,188
It's difficult, but if you can, playing from the section that happened before, so that you know that,

653
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:52,169
okay, that's kind of what I did there, so then people will expect something similar.

654
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:52,989
Cool.

655
00:57:53,129 --> 00:57:57,850
And kind of doing away with the idea that this is how it usually happens, because every time it's a new one.

656
00:57:58,331 --> 00:57:59,251
Okay. Thanks.

657
00:57:59,491 --> 00:57:59,631
Sure.

658
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:08,629
Hey guys. Hi. So I loved your approach of basing the sound and music around Lara's kind of narrative arc.

659
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:15,411
I was curious if you think that approach would work as well, like theoretically on a game where the main character's arc maybe isn't as well defined?

660
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:24,314
Like, can you use the audio to supply parts of that character that are missing, or do you need the writing to kind of really be there for that character first for this sort of audio approach to work?

661
00:58:25,374 --> 00:58:31,256
I think, you know, because using her arc was a new thing for me, I think that each game has its own...

662
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:35,947
the thing that will emerge as the anchor to use.

663
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:42,070
Like for me in the past, using the weapon for a first person shooter was really obvious for those games.

664
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:46,211
Different games that have kind of a different narrative structure or a different focus

665
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:50,633
will require a different approach to what you're going to use as your pillar.

666
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:55,615
It was really clear from the early creative direction for this game

667
00:58:56,288 --> 00:59:00,109
that the character arc was a real focus for the entire team.

668
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:01,970
So it was an easy thing,

669
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:05,592
and it took a while to really arrive at that consciously,

670
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:07,693
but it was an easy thing to really grab onto.

671
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:14,918
And yeah, from a music perspective, I think it's the other way to think about it is like, what is the narrative that is

672
00:59:15,539 --> 00:59:21,186
being communicated to the player? And if it really is the player's narrative more than it is a character's narrative,

673
00:59:21,206 --> 00:59:24,811
if it's a first-person shooter, it's more about the player's experience.

674
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:26,873
Identifying what that is...

675
00:59:27,714 --> 00:59:30,898
And then trying to support that emotion.

676
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:35,924
Coming in from that angle, thinking more about why you're doing this,

677
00:59:35,985 --> 00:59:41,151
as opposed to how you're going to do it, is generally my approach.

678
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:42,773
Cool, thanks.

679
00:59:42,793 --> 00:59:43,273
Thank you.

680
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:53,666
This is a question, I guess more for Alex. I'm really fascinated by the creative relationship between you and Jason.

681
00:59:55,027 --> 01:00:06,656
It seems that, from the impression that the way you were talking, was that he would, for the suites, would create an abundance of tracks for one piece.

682
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:13,781
And then you would, would you then have the creative control to decide what would work for certain scenes and layers and things like that?

683
01:00:14,892 --> 01:00:15,853
Yeah, basically.

684
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:23,620
I think what, you know, we were in a stage where both of us were kind of trying to discover

685
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,842
what the end solution of this would be.

686
01:00:25,862 --> 01:00:29,925
You know, it's when you look at something like this, you kind of go, oh yes, obviously

687
01:00:29,965 --> 01:00:30,486
it should be that.

688
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:34,509
But there was so much kind of discovery that happened along the way.

689
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:40,795
Where our relationship was most of the time was in the state of,

690
01:00:41,215 --> 01:00:45,778
I have experience as a composer, but I'm more interested in implementation, personally.

691
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,500
For me, composition is much more of a personal thing,

692
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:51,783
and I'd rather not do it for video games or movies.

693
01:00:52,223 --> 01:00:58,528
But for Jason, he knows a lot more about composition,

694
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,671
but he also knows he's worked on a ton of games,

695
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:04,653
and so there was this very...

696
01:01:07,136 --> 01:01:10,994
middle ground that we had there, where I knew a little bit about his world, he knew

697
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:11,636
about my world.

698
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:15,137
And we were able to talk the same language and figure it out together.

699
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:23,123
Because I think in the future, composers for video games are going to be essentially what we were as a unit.

700
01:01:23,443 --> 01:01:27,927
They're going to have a very good understanding of how the implementation is going to work.

701
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:30,969
And they're going to be composing within the game.

702
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:34,692
So I feel like that's the future for composers.

703
01:01:37,503 --> 01:01:40,668
This is kind of like the hybrid model that is a step closer to that.

704
01:01:40,688 --> 01:01:43,452
It's certainly a benefit for two people to have that back and forth.

705
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:49,892
Yeah, I think in any creative endeavor, if you can work back and forth with somebody, it's really good.

706
01:01:50,652 --> 01:01:53,795
But I feel like, you know, when you look at movie composers now,

707
01:01:55,276 --> 01:01:59,779
there's a very clear understanding that they're really supporting the emotion.

708
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,603
You know, somebody like Ennio Morricone, for example, I feel like a lot of his work

709
01:02:06,624 --> 01:02:09,466
is kind of like he's got a piece of music that he's putting in the movie,

710
01:02:09,486 --> 01:02:12,688
and it's almost like, you know, the old video game style.

711
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:22,716
I think he's one of the best composers. I'm not saying he's bad, but it's an older style of doing it.

712
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:30,743
I think maybe he'd be relying more on directors to tell him exactly what he wants, or what they want,

713
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:37,648
as opposed to a lot of film composers now instinctively knowing how something should be.

714
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:45,334
Any other questions? No? Thank you very much.
