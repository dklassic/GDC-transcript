00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:07,227
Hi, good afternoon.

2
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:11,450
First off, I want to start out by thanking Mike, wherever

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,591
he is, for bringing me in and allowing me to,

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,252
as I've realized as I've listened

5
00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,154
to all these talks today, be the absolute dumbest

6
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,315
person in the room.

7
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:22,916
No, it's OK.

8
00:00:24,817 --> 00:00:26,178
So thank you for bringing me in.

9
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:28,179
This has been really cool to just sit and listen

10
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,100
to all the talks.

11
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,672
This talk is a little bit different.

12
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,853
I don't have a PowerPoint because I don't have

13
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:36,514
a lot of cool technical stuff to show you.

14
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:42,637
This is actually a story that turns into an idea

15
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:45,438
that then turns into a technique

16
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,520
and kind of a nerdy obsession with what I am trying to do.

17
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:51,284
very well, hopefully.

18
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:55,748
How I got into motion capture was in 2007.

19
00:00:55,788 --> 00:01:00,111
I was standing on a sand stage in Ohio doing an outdoor drama,

20
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:02,073
riding horses, fighting with swords.

21
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:06,617
I'm a certified stage combat instructor and fight director.

22
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,339
And I was standing on stage and my phone rang.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,341
And it was a number from New York.

24
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,902
And it was a guy named Chuck Mongelli.

25
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,905
And he said, in a deep New York accent, he said,

26
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,746
hey, are you available next week?

27
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,475
And I was like, maybe.

28
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:21,716
And I turned to my director, I was like,

29
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,817
they want to bring me to New York to do motion capture

30
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:25,658
for a video game.

31
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:26,758
Can I go?

32
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,319
And he was like, yeah, we got it under study.

33
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:28,779
You go.

34
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:32,300
So I got on a 6 a.m. flight that next morning

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,961
and I flew to New York for the first time

36
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,822
and I got in a taxi cab and I drove out to Long Island

37
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:38,723
and I got out of the car and they put me in a suit

38
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:40,123
and they put markers all over me

39
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,224
and I walked into the studio

40
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:43,465
and my friend who had recommended me to Tim,

41
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,066
because Tim was the first person who hired me,

42
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,466
so thank you, brother.

43
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,520
I walked up to my friend in the volume and I said,

44
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,522
dude, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

45
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:56,304
And he goes, don't worry, nobody does.

46
00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:00,326
He's like, just listen, pay attention,

47
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:03,148
and just do you.

48
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:07,997
And so I did, I took his advice, I went out there, I did me, I got to play this character

49
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:10,879
named Johnny Gat, which was super cool.

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,081
I got to kind of get into what motion capture was.

51
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:20,186
And then when Saints Row 2 came out, I played the game and I was super pissed because I

52
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,067
could see myself on screen.

53
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:24,869
And I thought, that can't be right.

54
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,751
It can't be me, it's got to be him.

55
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,433
How the hell do I do this?

56
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:35,667
And so then that kind of started the obsession.

57
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:40,368
Coming back around, going into Saints Row 3 with Zach Lowery

58
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,230
who brought me in and started to make me play more characters.

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,751
We got into this thing, we called it the look

60
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:53,732
where we would have someone in the studio and they wouldn't be able

61
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:55,013
to do what he wanted them to do.

62
00:02:55,793 --> 00:03:00,434
And he'd go, and he'd look at me and I'd go.

63
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,889
And I knew that I was going to be doing that tomorrow.

64
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:12,794
And so I realized that I could make myself more useful

65
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,758
and more effective and more beneficial to the process

66
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,382
if I could kind of become all of these people

67
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:21,423
that I was trying to be.

68
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:23,905
And what I realized is doing motion capture performance,

69
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:27,129
I can be whoever I can truthfully move like.

70
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,081
It doesn't matter how tall I am, how much I weigh, what ethnicity I am.

71
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:37,804
I can play zombies, I can play aliens, I can play monsters, I can play regular people,

72
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:42,746
I can play gangsters, I can play whoever I can truthfully become within my own body.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,602
And what I realized was no one is teaching actors how to do this style of acting.

74
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:49,283
And that's what it is.

75
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:50,443
It is a style of acting.

76
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:51,263
I went to school.

77
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:55,165
I got a bachelor's degree in theater with an emphasis in acting.

78
00:03:55,585 --> 00:04:00,587
I then went on to get a master's degree with an emphasis in stage combat and movement performance.

79
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,689
And they taught me how to act on film and they taught me how to act on stage.

80
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:08,691
And what I see is typically motion capture performers coming in, doing their first few

81
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:08,951
jobs.

82
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:09,831
That's what they're doing.

83
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,932
They're just acting for the camera.

84
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:15,529
And that's really not what we're supposed to be doing.

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,511
So me being the academic nerd that I am when it comes

86
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,752
to performance, I said, I'm going to figure it out.

87
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:24,153
I'm going to sit down and try and figure out technique

88
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:28,634
because what we need as a performer is a base,

89
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,536
a structure to work within so that we can then be truthful

90
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:35,597
and live within the moment we're supposed to be portraying.

91
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,238
So actors are not trained to work.

92
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:44,976
in this industry, how do we train them to work in this industry?

93
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,917
And I started to sit down and think

94
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:50,178
about what motion capture performance really is.

95
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:53,818
And what I realized is I am puppeteering a rig of a character.

96
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,999
I have to become that character.

97
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,720
Now, how do I do that?

98
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,041
I have to find a natural state in myself that matches

99
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,842
up with the natural state of who that character is physically.

100
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:10,624
And I started to figure this process out,

101
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,365
and I started to think, what do I really need?

102
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:15,286
I need as much prep work as I can possibly get.

103
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:19,228
Anything that can tell me personality, movement style,

104
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,088
any type of particular I can get.

105
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:23,289
So I started looking at whether or not

106
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,530
I could get any type of concept art before a shoot.

107
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,032
and the guys at Volition would send me pictures and go,

108
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,773
this is what he looks like, and I'd talk on the phone

109
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,875
with the animation leads and Zach would say,

110
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:36,296
yeah, he's kind of like this, and he's like this character,

111
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:38,558
and you know, when we were developing him,

112
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:39,978
we kind of thought that he was like a mix

113
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,699
of these two people and like references

114
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:42,700
that I could go off of.

115
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,742
So once I have my prep work and I start to think

116
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:48,383
about who that character is, the first thing I have

117
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:50,144
to find is what I call the base.

118
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:55,534
And what that really is is the foot placement of where that character lives in their natural state.

119
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
In acting we call it neutral body.

120
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,342
How we all stand when we're not doing anything.

121
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:04,169
I think in animation you guys call it maybe an idol. Is that what it is?

122
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:07,820
Yeah, so in idle, we call it neutral body.

123
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,301
So I want to find neutral body, and I started to realize

124
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:14,543
that foot placement directly affects our center of gravity

125
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:15,203
as human beings.

126
00:06:15,603 --> 00:06:19,004
How I carry my body has a lot to do with my foot placement

127
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,845
and how I find my base.

128
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,247
Whether I tilt onto one hip, whether or not

129
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,748
I'm splay-footed because I might be a little bit overweight

130
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,468
and I want to relieve pressure on the back.

131
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:33,118
Or if I'm athletic, I may be a little bit more pigeon-toed and that tilts me a little bit forward,

132
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,381
moves my center of gravity up into my chest.

133
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:38,744
So once we find center of gravity,

134
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:42,608
I want to find balance with center.

135
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:46,682
And this is a really difficult thing for actors to find

136
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:50,044
because it's not how we naturally move in everyday life.

137
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:51,404
So you're told in the studio,

138
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,505
yeah, move naturally, move naturally, move naturally.

139
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:57,086
And then we move naturally and we cross our feet over

140
00:06:57,186 --> 00:07:00,288
and we screw up walks and turns right to left

141
00:07:00,348 --> 00:07:02,248
and we can't do these very simple things

142
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,289
that we do in regular life

143
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:07,090
because it's not exactly what the animators need

144
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,791
to create the character.

145
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,112
So I thought, what's the problem?

146
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,654
Because I sat in a studio and I watched all of my friends

147
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,736
who I work with try and turn left.

148
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,138
And they just, everyone, we kept screwing it up.

149
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,359
No one could turn left.

150
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,201
We kept falling, crossing our feet.

151
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,963
And it was like, no, you need to turn left and open up your hip.

152
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:27,365
And it was like, OK, how do we do this?

153
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,265
And I started watching.

154
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:31,548
And I realized that when we walk, we fall forward

155
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:32,489
and we catch ourselves.

156
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:33,870
It's a controlled fall.

157
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:37,813
But if I'm going to turn like that.

158
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,682
I can't do a controlled fall, I must control my center, I must keep my center.

159
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:49,567
So essentially I have to create an axis that goes down through my center line and splits

160
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:54,431
my base so that my feet are always evenly distributing weight as I walk.

161
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:59,495
And that's a very small kind of minute thing that probably doesn't show up anywhere, but

162
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:03,778
it allows me to move in any direction possible at any time.

163
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,422
So I found base, and I found balance.

164
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,615
Once I find base and balance, I allow myself to develop a character out through the extremities.

165
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:22,820
How does he or she hold their head, their arms, chest, shoulders, all the way out to finger

166
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,024
articulation, even if that's not even being captured. I want to have it as

167
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:30,726
part of my performance so that it's fully immersive.

168
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,731
So, breathe life into the character. I want to find natural structure.

169
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:41,119
Going back, we go into Saints Row 3,

170
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,722
Zach starts throwing more characters at me.

171
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:48,587
I'm thinking about Saints Row 2, where I watched myself

172
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:51,510
in a game, and it irritated me.

173
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:54,614
So I start to develop this technique,

174
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,115
and I start to play different characters.

175
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:58,098
And I realized that I was onto something,

176
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:59,339
because I could switch.

177
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,651
And you start getting thrown into scenes and they go,

178
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,812
well, we're gonna do one pass

179
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:04,872
and you're gonna play this character

180
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:05,893
and then we'll do another pass

181
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:06,933
and you'll play this character.

182
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:08,514
And they're actually gonna interact at one point,

183
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:09,614
but we'll handle that.

184
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,616
And we start working through different scenes

185
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:16,037
and I'm more and more characters

186
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:19,238
as we go through Saints Row Three and Saints Row Four.

187
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,999
So in my mind, I'm thinking, okay,

188
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,920
there's legs to this, it's working.

189
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,142
But I'm still not satisfied, right?

190
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:36,247
So, we move into Saints Row 4, then we go into Gat Out of Hell,

191
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:42,692
and I finally get to put this to work the way I think that it can kind

192
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:45,854
of culminate it into one single scene.

193
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:49,777
And it was a scene where we had a fight, and it was six demons

194
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,959
and Johnny Gat, and I walk into the studio,

195
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,640
and it's just me in the studio.

196
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,782
And I'm like, what are we doing?

197
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,423
And he's like, oh, you're playing everybody.

198
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:05,115
Okay, yeah, tight budget, you're playing everybody.

199
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:09,117
And so we developed this fight, choreographed the fight.

200
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,579
I'm swinging through air.

201
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,140
Here's where the demon's gonna be, backhand.

202
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,021
Here's where the demon's gonna be, throw a kick.

203
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,043
We do all this choreography, and then I go through,

204
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,744
and they marked on the floor where I got hit,

205
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:23,025
and they put a crash pad down,

206
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:25,046
and I'd come in and I'd do all the reactions,

207
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,307
just one after another,

208
00:10:26,987 --> 00:10:29,889
each character being a different person.

209
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,613
And then I see the final product that they stitched together,

210
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:36,834
and I'm fighting six different versions of me,

211
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:41,416
which for an actor is quite the ego trip

212
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,277
to be able to fight six versions of yourself.

213
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,299
But I still go back to the technique.

214
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,840
I need to become better at becoming other people.

215
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:57,262
So I start to get more immersed into the technique of motion

216
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:57,682
capture.

217
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:58,543
And what I realized

218
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:02,822
later on as we move into Agents of Mayhem is

219
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:06,046
if I have eyes on the front of my face I'm a hunter.

220
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,733
So that's where my movement, my instinct to move starts

221
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:15,838
is the eyes. But the movement of the body generates from the base

222
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:17,339
through the extremities.

223
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:24,071
So I start to develop characters and all the movement comes from the feet out through the body.

224
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:27,893
So if I need to lift a shoulder more, it's not about lifting the shoulder more,

225
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:33,156
it's about finding the instinct in the body and bringing enough energy through the shoulder

226
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,537
so that we get the right movement.

227
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:44,761
And I start to look into it deeper and deeper and we move into Ages of Mayhem and as we start working.

228
00:11:46,355 --> 00:11:49,916
All of these characters have distinct personalities,

229
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:52,877
weapon styles, distinct movement.

230
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:55,898
And I'm playing more and more every time I go to the studio.

231
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,058
Oh, you're gonna play this guy now,

232
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,078
you're gonna play that guy now,

233
00:11:58,098 --> 00:11:58,998
you're gonna play this guy now.

234
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,139
And I know that these characters are actually playable,

235
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,340
so they're on screen way more than like a boss

236
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,901
or a non-playable character that's a henchman

237
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:09,161
that you're gonna kill right away

238
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:12,122
that you're catching like a couple of motions on.

239
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,023
So then I get in my head and I'm like,

240
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:16,063
okay, I need to do more, I need to do more.

241
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:23,835
I start to find these characters' personalities within the movement.

242
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:31,741
Find the feet, find the center, find the base, and then I find the character.

243
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:35,144
I'm working off the voiceover, that adds to it.

244
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:41,049
So I have these little fidgets that I find in the voice that allows me to build on that

245
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:41,529
character.

246
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:52,550
So, the whole point of me being here is to really ask a question and be here to talk

247
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:59,296
to a lot of you about the problems that you have with performance. What are the hang-ups

248
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:03,419
and what are the things that you're not finding? Because as actors, we're still trying to figure

249
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:12,266
out what this is. And I think I have a good idea of what it's supposed to be, but it's

250
00:13:14,934 --> 00:13:23,376
It's a difficult thing because I'm trying to create the base of what this is supposed to be without any real knowledge of the other side of it.

251
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:32,639
I've realized through conversations with friends of mine who are animators that animators and actors are very much on two different sides of the same coin.

252
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:38,508
where we're trying to breathe life and create these characters and be truthful to these

253
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:44,793
characters but sometimes our communication doesn't really link up and we need to find

254
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:49,816
a way to better communicate with one another in the space and before we get in the space

255
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:55,960
so that we can become an asset to the project, more of an asset to the project.

256
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:03,625
I believe that creative collaboration is one of the greatest parts of my work.

257
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:09,571
I get to work with other people who do wonderful art, and I get to add my art to it and create

258
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:12,853
something that is better and complete.

259
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,416
We come together and create something together.

260
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:20,380
Without communication, I'm never going to find that.

261
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,541
We're never going to find that.

262
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,464
So basically that is...

263
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:28,537
my process for motion capture performance.

264
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,399
That's where I am at this point.

265
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,002
I'm playing, Mike, how many characters?

266
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:42,365
20 different characters on Agents of Mayhem

267
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:45,206
that range from playable characters to bosses.

268
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:47,207
It's pretty much every male character on the game

269
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:51,309
and constantly trying to figure out

270
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,291
how to make them more unique and more truthful to themselves.

271
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:03,306
trying to find that base so that I can live on my instincts as an actor.

272
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:11,772
I think a lot of people get into motion capture and they get overwhelmed by the kind of otherworldliness

273
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,253
of what it is compared to where we normally perform.

274
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,275
And they get freaked out and then they start to overthink.

275
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:21,138
And as I teach, I tell actors all the time, stay out of your head.

276
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,062
Once we are aware of what our instinct is, it ceases to be an instinct.

277
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:31,477
And so then our performance seems forced,

278
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,758
and it seems staged.

279
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,760
And you see falseness within the performance.

280
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,701
And I'm sure you guys who have worked

281
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:41,083
with motion capture actors have seen that before,

282
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,485
where the performance doesn't seem natural,

283
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,546
it doesn't seem real or truthful.

284
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:48,448
And typically it's because the actor's overthinking

285
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:49,348
what they're trying to do.

286
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,070
But the only way to not overthink it

287
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,112
is to have natural structure in the character,

288
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:56,113
a structure that...

289
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:01,743
that lives truthfully on my body, but is truthful to who that character is physically.

290
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:06,205
And once you find that, then you can kind of relax.

291
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:12,207
And you get into that character and then you're not you anymore, you're them.

292
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:18,529
And you move like them and you walk like them and you are able to add 300 pounds of weight

293
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:19,329
to your body.

294
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:24,051
Make yourself seem like you're maybe three feet taller than you actually are.

295
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:30,899
But it's a process and it's work that the actors need to be informed of.

296
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:41,662
And I think that we can get better performances out of motion capture because, again, we've

297
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:44,623
never been trained to do this and we're trying to figure it out as we go along.

298
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:50,305
So yeah, that's basically what I've got.

299
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,807
I wanted to leave time for questions,

300
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,728
and not just questions, but for me,

301
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:57,009
because this is a process that is very new

302
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:58,149
and I'm trying to figure it out,

303
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,431
I'd really like to hear problems that you've had,

304
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:02,952
things, hangups that you have,

305
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:04,112
things that have not worked

306
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,774
when you're in the motion capture studio with actors,

307
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:10,836
so that I have a sense of where I need to go with it.

308
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,802
I travel all over the country and I do stage combat workshops,

309
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:18,104
and they always want me to teach motion capture performance classes.

310
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:23,287
And I want to be able to give young actors who are in college

311
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:27,009
who want to come into this business and work with you guys on these games,

312
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,212
I want them to understand what's going to be expected of them,

313
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:36,555
and I want them to not be blindsided and not walk into a studio and go,

314
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:40,438
I don't know what the hell I'm doing, and have that terrifying moment.

315
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:44,128
where the door opens and you're afraid it might shut immediately.

316
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:48,149
So I'm very interested if there are any questions,

317
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:52,349
anything, any information that you can give me, anything that

318
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,990
you have a question about that I might be able to clear up from the actor's

319
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,811
mentality because we are not,

320
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,932
we have a different way of thinking. So

321
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,692
the microphones are open if you have any questions, anything?

322
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,853
Hello, I'm actually very curious and wanna,

323
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:13,734
I've been trying to visualize,

324
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,356
can you transform into some distinct characters

325
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:21,499
and move and talk us through how you're doing that right now?

326
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:22,559
Yeah, like right now?

327
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,441
Well, okay, I'll start out with Gat,

328
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,741
because he's kind of the,

329
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,223
probably the most famous character that I've played.

330
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,665
The big thing that got with me about Gat was,

331
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:35,368
When I saw the first design, the first picture of him,

332
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:36,431
when Tim showed me the first picture,

333
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,915
I was like, this is the guy you're gonna play.

334
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,101
He had this fleur-de-lis tattoo on his neck.

335
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:45,049
And so when I kind of found him, I found him with this like tilt to his head

336
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,151
because I thought if someone has a tattoo on their neck,

337
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:49,973
then they're going to want to show that off.

338
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:51,794
So that's kind of the focal point of who they are.

339
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,917
And then when I heard Daniel Dae Kim's voiceover, he does these really amazing kind

340
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:59,980
of, he has this crazy cool speech pattern and these little inhalations.

341
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,662
And so I started to get all these like little shoulder shrugs

342
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:03,842
and this little head nod here.

343
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,724
And he always had this kind of like.

344
00:19:07,374 --> 00:19:11,143
aggressive energy that felt like it was just going to pop out at you at any time.

345
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,270
And I thought that was very important because he kills like millions of people.

346
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:19,584
in the world that he's in and I thought he should always feel a little unstable

347
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:20,864
but in a really cool way.

348
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:24,386
And so it started with just that tilt of the head

349
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:27,987
and finding this structure and being able to balance that structure

350
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,808
and then you could kind of play off of that.

351
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:32,289
And I could play off of Daniel's voiceover which was

352
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,590
when you have a good voiceover actor and you've got that voiceover

353
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,191
and you can play off of it and let the voice kind of move the body

354
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:41,433
it's an absolute luxury to have that.

355
00:19:41,993 --> 00:19:43,513
So voiceover actors are like...

356
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,973
I love it when I have the performance to work on in the studio.

357
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:47,854
But that's...

358
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:49,955
I hope that helped.

359
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:50,796
Yeah?

360
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:52,297
Hey.

361
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:52,898
Hey.

362
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:53,819
Sorry.

363
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,143
So, if when you're on a mo-cap stage, if you could grab the animator or director by the

364
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:04,127
shoulders and shake them and tell them like one thing about how they are failing to direct

365
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,009
you, what would that one thing be?

366
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,650
Tell me what you want.

367
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:10,153
For real.

368
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:10,413
I...

369
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:11,454
I...

370
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:17,104
It's something I had to go through Tim and Ev, our cinematics director.

371
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:18,826
Ev has a tell.

372
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:22,589
When he wants something and he isn't getting it, he does this.

373
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,850
And I picked up on it.

374
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,892
So every time he does this, I go, Ev, what do you want?

375
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:27,873
Just tell me what you want.

376
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:32,417
Because we want to do what you want.

377
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:36,640
But I feel like there's a mindset of, yeah, that's fine.

378
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,121
We'll fix the rest of it later.

379
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,298
And I personally don't want that to be the case.

380
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:45,238
I want to give you as much as I possibly can as an actor

381
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,679
so that you have less work to do,

382
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,340
so that you have a stronger base to start with

383
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,021
because it's never my performance on the game, ever.

384
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:58,223
It's always added and pulled and stretched and moved

385
00:20:58,263 --> 00:21:01,384
and exaggerated in ways to make me look way cooler

386
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,764
than I ever could in real life.

387
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:05,885
But the more I can give you to start out with,

388
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,627
I think the better the end product can be.

389
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:11,888
So the big thing is tell me what you want

390
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:13,829
and I will do everything I can to make it happen.

391
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,550
And if I can't make it happen,

392
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,592
then you know, that's where we are, yeah?

393
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:19,872
Yes.

394
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:21,333
I just had a question,

395
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:23,154
if you've ever had to play a character

396
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:24,975
so far different from yourself,

397
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,156
like a humanoid alien or something similar,

398
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:28,997
and do you go about doing anything different

399
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,878
to get into that role?

400
00:21:30,337 --> 00:21:36,461
Yeah, yes, aliens and zombies and all sorts of crazy things that I've played before.

401
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:45,367
I did Zinyak on Saints Row 4 and I just tried, what I started to understand about characters

402
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,870
that were larger than me is that as long as they're proportional, they're not larger than

403
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:49,990
me.

404
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:55,980
because I can make myself appear as large as I need to be in that rig.

405
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,684
So if I can move the rig in a truthful way,

406
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,407
then I'm as heavy as I need to be for that character.

407
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:04,631
And most of the time, larger characters or kind of other worldly characters,

408
00:22:04,652 --> 00:22:05,372
things that are not.

409
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:07,634
quite the same as my structure.

410
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:09,434
It's about just kind of understanding

411
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,215
why they need to move the way they move.

412
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,255
And again, I find that from the base normally.

413
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,276
If I can find the right foot placement,

414
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,936
it's weird, I've become obsessed with how people walk.

415
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:20,356
My wife gets mad at me and she's like,

416
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,717
stop looking at people's feet.

417
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:25,237
But it's because I realized that the way people

418
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:27,758
use their feet really affects the rest of their body.

419
00:22:28,118 --> 00:22:29,458
And it all kind of starts from there.

420
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:32,499
So if I can find that, I'm typically in a good spot.

421
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:37,457
quick follow up, is bigger or smaller characters harder to play or the same for you?

422
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:43,020
Same exact. Yeah, as long as I can find the structure, man. It's like. Thank you. No

423
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,703
problem. Thank you. Hi, so my question is about, you mentioned how you

424
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:54,705
had to modify the way you walk with your center of gravity so that you could do the turns

425
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,626
without having problems, etc.

426
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:04,249
But you also mentioned how you had your background in the fight career, so there's some athletic

427
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:11,773
background you have, and now you want to shoot a fight scene, you're trying to adjust that

428
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:17,279
sports knowledge, so to speak, to a mocap performance.

429
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:19,541
I'm interested in how you do that.

430
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,503
Like, is there a particular process or any tips you have

431
00:23:22,563 --> 00:23:26,026
for, like, you know how to play basketball,

432
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:28,888
and then you want to make a mocap of you making a shot.

433
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,129
Like, how do you adjust that?

434
00:23:30,906 --> 00:23:36,249
Well, it's funny because the fight stuff, it's actually how we move when we create combat.

435
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,412
Is how I'm walking in a mocap studio and keeping my center line.

436
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:44,214
We talk about grounding and centering the body when we fight.

437
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:49,957
Because if I'm in a fight, I have to be able to move any direction at the drop of a dime,

438
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:50,237
right?

439
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:50,937
Or I'll die.

440
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,713
Yeah? I gotta get out of the way of the sword.

441
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:56,974
So, tilting my weight all onto one foot,

442
00:23:57,334 --> 00:24:01,535
it really puts me at a disadvantage if I'm in physical altercation.

443
00:24:01,555 --> 00:24:03,316
So you're constantly trying to find balance.

444
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:07,116
So what I did was, when I realized that I already had that training,

445
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:09,517
I just applied it to everyday movement.

446
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:12,078
So that I could control the movement better,

447
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,138
but not look like I was controlling the movement.

448
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:16,259
With acting, we want the technique to disappear.

449
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,919
If you see the technique, we're screwed.

450
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:20,328
because then it looks false.

451
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,451
But if I can make the technique disappear,

452
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:24,814
let the technique be the base

453
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,656
and move naturally within the technique

454
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,418
in natural structure,

455
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:30,261
natural structure meaning

456
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:33,425
I don't want to hold a character in my muscles.

457
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:38,167
If I hold a character in my muscles, it's very hard to find that character because if

458
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:42,409
my muscles are sore, I haven't worked out as much or I've worked out too much, it's

459
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:43,210
going to be a little different.

460
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,613
But if I can find character in my natural structure of my body and allow myself to find

461
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:53,815
how the arms hang, then I can play from natural structure as opposed to unnatural structure.

462
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,577
But the fighting stuff really actually helped me.

463
00:24:58,478 --> 00:24:58,738
Was that?

464
00:24:59,238 --> 00:24:59,618
Yeah.

465
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:00,759
Wonderful, thank you.

466
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:07,574
So sometimes we have to make animations that are going to be applied and used on just tons

467
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:09,255
and tons of different characters as evenly.

468
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:13,358
Have you ever had to record animations that are supposed to be generic?

469
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,241
When you do, like, how do you, since you don't have that one character to find, how do you

470
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:17,681
go about that?

471
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:19,522
Well, it's actually, it's actually pretty easy.

472
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:20,723
Normally I'll, I'll...

473
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:28,589
I have references that I use if it's like a general male character, like an everyday

474
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,090
male character, I'll just use myself.

475
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,993
I'm 5'10", I weigh about 180 pounds, I'm a white male in my 30s, I just use myself.

476
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:39,196
And then I have other friends, if it's an athletic male, I have friends who are very

477
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:42,698
athletic and very small and I just, it's about, for me it's about prep work.

478
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,640
I'm constantly watching the way people move and just putting it in the bank.

479
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,166
and watching people's feet. And luckily I teach movement so I'm constantly watching people develop

480
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:59,050
performance movement and that helps tremendously too. But with generic stuff it's like

481
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,414
I find a character that I consider kind of generic and and I go from there.

482
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:05,675
All right, cool. Thank you.

483
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:13,947
Yeah, you had talked about instances where vocal delivery informs your performance.

484
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:14,227
Yes.

485
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:19,009
And I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the interaction between two performances

486
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:22,751
that go into making one character, and are there any instances where...

487
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:27,481
your physical performance is informing the vocal performance or where you wish

488
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:28,902
that that were the case?

489
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,065
I can't speak on whether or not the physical performance

490
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:37,148
changes the vocal performance because I've never been on the other side of that

491
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:40,851
but I know that

492
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:44,799
As an actor, we learn voice and body is connected.

493
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,360
Voice drives the body and the body drives the voice

494
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,901
and it's like this circle.

495
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,442
So the way someone speaks is going to affect

496
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:52,923
the way they move and the way they move

497
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:55,624
actually affects the way they speak.

498
00:26:56,164 --> 00:26:58,525
If you've ever seen hip hop artists

499
00:26:58,585 --> 00:26:59,686
and the way they move their body

500
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,707
to get a certain sound to come out of their voice,

501
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,448
it's kind of a circle and it's always connected.

502
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:07,990
So yeah, I hope that answered.

503
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:11,405
some of your questions.

504
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,826
Last question over here, because I'm about to wrap up.

505
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:16,167
So just to elaborate on what you were saying about,

506
00:27:16,187 --> 00:27:17,727
obviously the obvious, tell me what you need.

507
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:21,209
Is there anything beforehand, or what are the kind of

508
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,190
the key, clear bits of information you want

509
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,651
about a character before, and during the shoot?

510
00:27:26,351 --> 00:27:29,692
Yeah, I mean, honestly, and I know that we live in a world

511
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:31,433
where everything tries to get leaked on the internet,

512
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:34,454
so everybody is very secure about the information

513
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:35,234
that they give out.

514
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:40,528
But anything that I can get that can tell me who that character is,

515
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,752
tendencies, weapon styles, fighting styles,

516
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,695
what characters I've already played that they interact with

517
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:49,598
and how they interact with them within the story will help me kind

518
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:51,219
of develop a personality.

519
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,263
And then I can start to play with who that person is.

520
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:56,145
Because I'm doing movement, but I'm.

521
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,101
I hear the voice, I understand the personality,

522
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:02,863
and so therefore I'm trying to create the full character

523
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:05,204
even though all that's being captured is the movement.

524
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:08,725
So I make noise in the space, I try and vocalize

525
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:11,627
because if I can vocalize, then it'll help me move

526
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,968
a little bit more natural and more realistic

527
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:15,889
and get a better shot.

528
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,651
So yeah, really anything, any information

529
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:22,732
that the actor can get can help them just be more informed.

530
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:24,213
Because if they're not informed,

531
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:25,654
then they're trying to catch up.

532
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:29,544
in the space and a lot of them, a lot of people won't.

533
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:32,165
They'll just check out and they'll go,

534
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:33,966
okay, I'll do what they say and then I'll go home.

535
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,087
And I just, I personally want more than that.

536
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:39,307
I want the performance to mean more.

537
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:40,447
I want the project to be good

538
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,628
and I wanna be a healthy part of the process.

539
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:47,289
So any information, any prep information

540
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:48,010
really, really helps.

541
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,470
Thank you.

542
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,390
Yeah, I think I'm done.

543
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,360
Thank you guys so much for allowing me to come into your community and talk.

544
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,542
This has been wonderful.

545
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:00,164
Thank you.
