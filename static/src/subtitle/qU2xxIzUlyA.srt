00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:02,728
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:04,228
My name is Brian Francis.

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:06,249
I am the invisible voice inside your head.

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,390
I am here as always.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,391
We are here on the GDC Twitch channel playing interesting games, talking to interesting

6
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,232
people who make them.

7
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:17,893
Today we are checking out After Party, which comes from Night School Studio based in Los

8
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:18,353
Angeles.

9
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:22,195
And one of the people from Night School is here in the lower left hand corner of the

10
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:22,575
screen.

11
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:25,056
Adam, how are you doing?

12
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:26,136
Could you introduce yourself?

13
00:00:26,576 --> 00:00:27,797
Because you can do it better than I can.

14
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:36,927
Well, thank you. Hi, I'm Adam Hines. I co-founded Night School Studio about five or six years ago with my cousin, Sean.

15
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,934
And I'm kind of the de facto game director, and I wrote...

16
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,286
Kind of 80 to 90% of the script of this game.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,849
And then I had a ton of help with the design and the art and the whole rest of the team

18
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:53,970
built out it all.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,573
I can describe After Party, I would describe it as a kind of comedy game, comedy adventure

20
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:01,153
where you're fighting your way out of hell.

21
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:03,534
Instead of fighting your way out of hell, you're drinking your way out of hell.

22
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:07,196
And there's Twitter in hell, which we're just seeing right now behind us.

23
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:11,138
Adam, how would you describe After Party?

24
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:19,469
Afterparty. I would describe Afterparty as a game about two college kids, Milo and Lola,

25
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,293
who, uh, they've just graduated college, they've been best friends their entire lives,

26
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:31,757
and they think that they're about to kind of leave school and start their adventure off into adulthood

27
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:34,939
and kind of figure out who they want to be, but it turns out that they have died.

28
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,583
They have died tragically and have gone to hell, and they do not remember how and they do not remember why.

29
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:43,895
But throughout the first hour where they get processed,

30
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:47,417
and it's kind of like a hell version of DMV where you have to stand in line and

31
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:54,119
kind of get accused of the things that you've done and assigned what your torture will be,

32
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:59,701
right before they're about to get assigned, the kind of work bell chimes to six,

33
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:00,381
and the demon's like,

34
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:05,143
Okay, I'm going home, report back here in the afternoon.

35
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,304
And they're like, Okay, but what are we supposed to do until then?

36
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:09,204
And he's like, you know, just hang out and get your

37
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:14,065
You know, get your stuff straight because you're going to be in hell now for the rest of eternity.

38
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:19,709
And they decide to go to a bar, and at the bar they figure out that there's a loophole.

39
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:25,373
And if you are able to find Satan and out-drink him and out-party him, he will actually let you back.

40
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:27,414
And let you back to Earth.

41
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:32,538
So Milo and Lola specifically are two people who are not big partiers.

42
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:33,759
Milo is a guy who...

43
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:42,280
His kind of his whole schooling years and college life, he's kind of wanted to be more of a social guy and wanted to kind of make more friends.

44
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,201
And so it's been a little hard for him.

45
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,682
And Lola is the type of person who just does not care.

46
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:51,623
She just wants to make an impact in the world and make a positive change.

47
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:55,685
So she's been very kind of focused on her career and what she wants to do.

48
00:02:55,725 --> 00:03:02,927
So they're both kind of untrained and really being party animals.

49
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:08,308
So, of course, this is like the worst situation for them to fall in because now they're stuck in hell.

50
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:16,113
So the game is trying to basically be on the supernatural adventure bar crawl where you're trying to find Satan and out party him.

51
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,075
Right on. Alex, I forgot to let you introduce yourself.

52
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,596
Hi, who are you?

53
00:03:20,716 --> 00:03:21,897
I was following podcast rules.

54
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:23,718
I was seeing how long we could go with me just not talking.

55
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,800
Alex, how are you doing?

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,601
Hey, what's up? I'm all right.

57
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:29,542
I work on GDC with Brian here.

58
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:30,823
I'm having a fantastic time.

59
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,904
Adam, thank you for joining us.

60
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:32,905
This game is super cool.

61
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,315
I kind of want to start by just digging right into the writing.

62
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:40,537
I've played a little bit, and I'm just really charmed by these characters and the situations

63
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:41,238
they fall into.

64
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:47,362
Like, how do you write funny characters that are a decade or more younger than you?

65
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,306
It's a good question.

66
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:56,588
Like, people typically in writing...

67
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:01,852
themselves up is that they tried to think of it in that way of thinking of it like,

68
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:07,453
okay, now I'm a 22 year old person with this specific upbringing and this is where I live.

69
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:11,353
We lost you, we lost you to internet lag.

70
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:12,514
Oh, okay. Sorry.

71
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:12,894
I liked it.

72
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:14,414
Yes. No, I was just saying that I feel like.

73
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:38,283
People kind of trip themselves up in writing characters where they try to really put themselves in a very hyper-specific mindset,

74
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:44,767
where if they're writing like a 16-year-old or a 22-year-old or an 80-year-old,

75
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:51,010
they're trying to get in a good location with talk and act.

76
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,933
And I kind of, and we as a studio, definitely just approach it that way.

77
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:57,838
as

78
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:06,482
characters are not really caring if they don't exactly sound like your typical 21 year old or 25 year old or 16 year old.

79
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:10,904
It's one of those things where this is going to be a very random reference.

80
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:17,686
But I remember when Dawson's Creek came out and the reviews for that show were like,

81
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,687
no teenager talks like this.

82
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,968
Like, they talk too smart.

83
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:24,429
And I remember thinking, why is that a bad thing?

84
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,770
That's not so gay.

85
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:33,316
If the characters sound different than how you would naturalistically expect them to

86
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:34,717
be able to express themselves.

87
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:38,898
As long as the stories are impactful and interesting and the characters are unique and engaging,

88
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:44,500
then you're doing your job and that's all you really need to worry about.

89
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:50,383
So yeah, I just took a lot from my own life too and from just people that I knew and their

90
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:52,123
own concerns.

91
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:58,911
This is one of those things where particularly with these characters, you just hear over and over again,

92
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:05,057
just, you're afraid that you're kind of missing out and it's that FOMO thing of just,

93
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:09,461
I don't think I'm ever at the right place that I want to be, I'm not having as much fun as I can.

94
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:15,213
With Instagram and the internet, this is kind of ramping up that feeling of you're only seeing everyone else's best

95
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:19,914
times and you think if you're not having those times too, then you're doing something wrong.

96
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:23,816
And that's definitely kind of Milo's point of view. And then just how

97
00:06:24,936 --> 00:06:31,439
how awful everything seems right now with just everything that's pouring out every day from the news. I feel like

98
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,059
particularly the younger generation,

99
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,722
I'm sure just feels a helplessness and just how to make a positive change and just where to even start.

100
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,622
So that's kind of where Lola is, where she's at too.

101
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:49,243
Nice. Yeah, I mean, fortunately, like, the internet does not want these secrets to get out,

102
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:50,904
so you got kind of choppy in the middle of that there.

103
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:51,644
Oh, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:54,685
No, it was great. It's not your fault at all. Again, it's higher powers.

105
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,726
But like, if anyone missed it, like, what I got from that is that you really didn't

106
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,946
stress too much about trying to write young people.

107
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:03,667
You thought, you tried to write characters who had meaningful concerns

108
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,648
and meaningful personalities and just went from there.

109
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:08,088
And it seems to really pay off. I'm curious.

110
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:15,240
Because I find, you know, the art of writing, of good writing in a game seems so mysterious.

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,541
Like, how did you check yourself on this?

112
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:21,902
Did you playtest it with people of a certain age group or certain places?

113
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,042
Did you show it to friends?

114
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,162
Did you, like, have consultants?

115
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:28,143
Like, how did you verify that the work you were putting out was actually something that's

116
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,944
like funny and entertaining to people who don't know you?

117
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,985
Yeah, so we are...

118
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,326
Because it is.

119
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,386
Yeah, it's kind of a combo.

120
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:45,347
Well, thank you. Yeah, it's kind of a combo of things. One is that, yeah, I and Sean and

121
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:51,672
Sean and I and the leads of the studio kind of always have a very concrete and kind of

122
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:57,075
very specific feeling that we want to go after. And we're always just very honest with ourselves

123
00:07:57,135 --> 00:08:03,240
if we're hitting the mark or not. So it's just a lot of rewriting and a lot of really

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,582
just going over and over and over and editing and being just.

125
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:10,298
trying to be very honest with ourselves if it's working or not.

126
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,279
Obviously, within kind of the time strains that we have to make a game and still

127
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,940
stay and still stay an actual

128
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,442
company. But so we just kind of really just have a lot of faith in our

129
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,322
abilities to make this stuff.

130
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:29,923
But then also the the team who's playing this this stuff and

131
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:31,744
reading the scripts and.

132
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,875
and doing the game and kind of really thinking a lot.

133
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,797
They're always very honest with us.

134
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:41,119
If they feel like a joke has gone too far,

135
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,521
or if a character's not getting enough room,

136
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:46,124
or just any kind of issues that they feel like cropping up,

137
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:50,688
where if I'm writing page 600 of an 1800-page script,

138
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,449
and I'm just very, very focused on,

139
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:54,511
okay, this quest needs something X, Y, and Z.

140
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:56,453
If I'm kind of missing that,

141
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:58,335
oh, I actually know Milo needs...

142
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,953
moment here or Lola needs more of a scene here.

143
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:06,296
The people who are just kind of making the game and implementing it will always

144
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,458
tap me on the shoulder and tap us on the shoulder and say, I'm really feeling

145
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:10,939
this and that, I'm really feeling like this

146
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,241
misses the mark or this joke is punching down or

147
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,684
so we're just kind of always really trying to check ourselves

148
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,386
and with these games in particular it's frustratingly hard

149
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,328
to kind of put it in front of

150
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:31,894
um, people who aren't actually making it yet to play it and play test it and really see how it's working just because these games are

151
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:35,358
Horrible until they're like almost done

152
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:42,464
So it's like until it's like the animations are doing the right thing and all the vo is in and the timing is there

153
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:43,786
Because they're so story

154
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,008
focused that if

155
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:52,021
But even if everything is in, but just the voiceover timing is off,

156
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,342
then it's like that kills every joke.

157
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:57,364
And the feeling is very different than the one that we want.

158
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,586
So it's tough to kind of put it in players' hands until

159
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:03,568
it's almost too late to change too many things,

160
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,189
which makes it pretty scary when we're working on it.

161
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,570
But that's just why we always have to really

162
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,731
kind of be really honest with ourselves

163
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,213
and keep us in check about what's really working and what's not,

164
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:14,114
and going back, and if it's not working, try and...

165
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,075
Over in chat, Statistat has a good question.

166
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:22,677
How far did you go through an iteration, I guess on each section, before you checked whether it was working?

167
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:27,839
Statistat guesses you didn't rewrite the entire story every time you were iterating on a section.

168
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:29,319
We did not.

169
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:36,021
So yeah, basically our process is that we'll come up with a story, just conceit.

170
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,922
And the obvious one for this one was,

171
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:43,404
if you're stuck in hell, you have to outdrink a bunch of...

172
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:48,988
Demons and characters that you'll be running into.

173
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,410
So it's a bar crawl focused game with kind of a supernatural bent.

174
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,253
And we'll try and think of different, just pure gameplay mechanics that can support that and be built around it.

175
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:07,257
And once we've kind of like kicked the tires on that a ton and felt like good about kind of moving on to what...

176
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,862
Story then can kind of support the gameplay mechanics. Then we try and make a really strong outline of just okay

177
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:17,483
These are the big beats. This is like chapter 0 chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3

178
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:24,805
And really go over that and debate it and argue and see how much that we need and how much that we we want

179
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,526
And then we just start to just jump in and we just write each

180
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:33,167
scene and we'll have read-throughs of each scene where the entire team kind of comes in and

181
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,269
and plays a part.

182
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,272
And then one person will actually play the scene,

183
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,195
meaning they'll make the choices and will jump in the script to where that goes.

184
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:44,597
And at the end we just kind of talk about it,

185
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,599
and we talk about what has worked and what didn't,

186
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,684
what jokes we thought were good, where you were confused.

187
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:56,168
That's kind of a way to know your goals and what you're doing,

188
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:59,411
and you can be kind of surprised.

189
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:10,895
The audience was like, oh, I didn't know that guy was like the thief the whole time, but in a game you kind of have to know there's always going to be elements of narrative surprise.

190
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:20,217
So it's kind of a careful act of smoothing things from the scripting phase.

191
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:28,640
And then once we feel like everything is pretty locked in to a degree that we're confident that even if there are rewrites, which there always are, we can start building the big...

192
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:36,630
pieces, then yeah, then we just start to implement things and play it as we as we can. But there's

193
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,093
typically two or three more passes of rewrites once we start to play it and we see like this

194
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:47,596
is taking too long or I don't know why I'm doing this, this is confusing and we'll change and tweak.

195
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,517
Nice. Yeah, I um...

196
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:55,474
We should talk a bit about the way you overlaid a system of drinking on top of all that.

197
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,535
I think Brian's seen more of it than I have, so I can't speak to it with any kind of expertise.

198
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:02,716
Hopefully we'll see it in a second, but it's the system where drinking changes the dialogue

199
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:04,257
choices, which creates a third...

200
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:04,897
It sort of creates...

201
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,538
If there's a dialogue choice, there's usually two options.

202
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,558
There's a third option, but I guess we can...

203
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,320
So far from what I've seen, there's five different options for a conversation.

204
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,862
Depending on what drink you get but you can only access one of the one of the thirty

205
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,022
You only have three available to you

206
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:24,845
But the it seems like you guys planned a total of five for these conversations like drinking game logic is fun

207
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:30,788
How'd you come up with that and and what's the logic behind it from a structuring and scripting standpoint?

208
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:39,852
yeah, we we definitely wanted to make drinking be fun in this game and be a hundred percent fun and not be a

209
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:40,712
any sort of a

210
00:13:42,145 --> 00:14:01,219
A hindrance or penalize you because in every other game it had felt like you know you take a drink and like in Red Dead you'll be drinking the screen will get wobbly and like you can't walk and we were like well we obviously can't do that with this game because the entire game is about about going to bars and having a drink and have that affect you.

211
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:11,266
So we came up with this concept where basically in hell these drinks kind of act more like a magical potion where.

212
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,018
The ingredients that go into these drinks are impossible to make here.

213
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:20,985
They're like, it's a child's tears with a dollop of insanity, and that makes this drink.

214
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:26,956
and when you drink the end every drink in the game, like you said, every bar has four drinks

215
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:33,240
and that basically comes out to about three specific types of personality traits that you can get per bar.

216
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,284
So for instance, you'll go into a bar and you'll see the menu and based on the reviews, you'll get an idea of what that drink will do.

217
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:44,487
So it might make you more angry or it might make you more want to flirt with people in the bar

218
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,368
or it might make you talk like a pirate or.

219
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:52,210
Talk like a mobster or throw up your conscience, and then your conscience is a little character, and then all your choices are bad.

220
00:14:52,650 --> 00:15:00,172
So the variety of what the drinks can do to you is pretty... are.

221
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:05,713
So we wanted to expand on Oxenfree, our first game.

222
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:13,355
That game, for those of you who haven't seen it, you always have permanently three...

223
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:18,785
choices whenever your opportunity to speak comes up and those

224
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:25,871
come directly from what Alex, the character you play as, what her personality, would just naturally let her or

225
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:30,415
allow her to say. Just, just the

226
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:35,800
the things that that person would possibly want to say are kind of your choices in that game. And in this game

227
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,942
we wanted to make it more like, no, you can kind of...

228
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:42,649
set what you want your personality type to be based on when you walk in the bar and you

229
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:47,032
kind of survey who's there and what the bar is kind of like.

230
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:52,375
Because it was important for us to kind of get at the feeling of an actual bar crawl,

231
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:57,598
meaning when you go out and you're like, no, actually I know I can't drink too much vodka

232
00:15:57,618 --> 00:16:03,142
because when I drink vodka I get pissed off, or when I drink Jack I'll just end up passed

233
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:03,362
out.

234
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:08,085
But maybe you want to feel those ways so you kind of drink in that specific way.

235
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,343
So we really wanted you to kind of have that in this game.

236
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:19,917
And it kind of dovetails into the puzzles and kind of how you want to approach certain obstacles and goals.

237
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:31,471
There's a part early in the game where some friends of yours go upstairs to a private VIP part of the bar and the bouncer won't let you up.

238
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:43,558
So you can drink a bunch of drinks and play beer pong against another person and to impress them you can insult them based on the personality type that you have in the drink.

239
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:48,237
or you can drink a particular kind of concoction that will make you more angry

240
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:51,999
and then kind of rile up two people that are already in an argument into a fight

241
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,282
and then that'll distract the guy and then that can get you upstairs then.

242
00:16:56,282 --> 00:17:02,487
So we just wanted you to kind of be able to overcome certain chat challenges and play

243
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:07,090
these bars and kind of the personality type that you wanted to.

244
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,133
And then also just to kind of feed multiple pull-throughs just because

245
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,315
every time you say anything there's some...

246
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:18,665
joke. And if you didn't like the last joke, if you wait 10 seconds, it's going to be a new joke.

247
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:21,868
So it's just that type of game.

248
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:25,691
Right on. Yeah. I imagine that must have complicated the production process.

249
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:31,075
Like, how did that change the way you guys approach designing, laying out and sort of writing

250
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,356
through all these different options?

251
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:35,219
It didn't change it too much.

252
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:42,745
It changed it in the way that you just had to know ahead of time that, OK, all of these

253
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,553
Dance for those types of events.

254
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:59,577
So for instance, there, there's a bar where you go into and there's a kind of a light puzzle in the conversation of both trying to convince someone to at least make an effort with someone that thee just broke up with.

255
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:02,958
And there's no cases where that concludes the art course.

256
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:09,139
So it's really about trying to convince someone to at least make an effort with someone that they just broke up with.

257
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,454
And then there's other stuff that also happens in that bar.

258
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:17,580
But we knew that at least one drink then had to be kind of focused on romance,

259
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,125
just because that was going to be a thing that was going to happen in that spot.

260
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:25,970
So it was just really a matter of kind of charting that out ahead of time

261
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,431
and making sure that all made sense.

262
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:31,873
Whereas in Oxenfree or in other narrative games, it's very just context based.

263
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:42,115
Just the things that you say above your head or in the menu are just exactly what needed to be in that at that time.

264
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:46,936
But in this game, of course, if you're drinking a drink and the drink makes you really angry,

265
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:52,357
there has to be an angry choice for every single possible time you can speak in that bar.

266
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:55,098
And that made it hard sometimes because it's like if.

267
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,695
you want to challenge somebody to a fight, we have to kind of let you do that and have

268
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:05,940
it somehow get back to the main plot and not spiral out of control through this whole other

269
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,580
game.

270
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:12,686
So that was the hardest part, was just making it feel still like you're able to customize

271
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:17,851
the experience as much as you would want to, but not make a game that has 800 hours worth

272
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,572
of content.

273
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:21,274
Yeah, it's crazy.

274
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:25,549
I think this game is pretty funny and comedic timing.

275
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:31,333
You would think, you know, making a game is hella hard, but you have full control over

276
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:32,434
like everything.

277
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:35,896
You can set the timing, you can set the speed of the dialogue, you can pick the actors.

278
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:39,038
You would think it'd be pretty easy, but actually it's incredibly hard.

279
00:19:39,318 --> 00:19:40,259
You would think, yes.

280
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,220
You would think it would be very easy.

281
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,383
Honestly, yeah, the tough part, yeah, particularly with comedy is just the timing.

282
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:49,125
If the timing's off even a bit, then yeah, the joke is killed.

283
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:58,007
With a game that we really, in all of our games, we really want you to always have just control of the character as much as possible.

284
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:07,257
So there's very little times where we'll force you to like stand here or force you to lock in or the camera will move in and we'll force the characters to walk around.

285
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:13,184
We definitely had to do that more in this game than Oxenfree just because there's way more going on on the screen.

286
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:19,409
and it kind of gave Oxenfree a cool feeling, uh, because, um, you're just with one other

287
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:26,778
character kind of in these very, uh, spooky, empty, um, outside env- environments for the

288
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:32,737
Most part and it felt good to let you just kind of be running around and climbing trees and jumping on logs and stuff as

289
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:39,342
You're having a conversation and not really care that it doesn't really look like you're looking at the person you're talking to just because you're walking

290
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,384
And you're going on hikes and things but in this game

291
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:46,728
You're like sitting at bars, and you're leaning on stools, and you're looking at a billion characters on screen

292
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:53,473
And we really kind of had to treat that a bit just to make sure that the timing there and the voice acting kind of all

293
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:54,153
worked

294
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:58,577
But yeah, but it was still hard at times because we'll watch people play it.

295
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:01,238
And I'm like, oh, here comes this brilliant joke.

296
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:03,958
And then they'll like walk off screen, like right when it hits.

297
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:06,979
And like, oh, OK.

298
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,520
But you just have to like let that go just because, of course,

299
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,641
the freedom of being able to control it is worth so much more than like,

300
00:21:12,781 --> 00:21:15,641
now you got my dumb poop joke that I put in there.

301
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:16,582
So nice.

302
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,763
Yeah, I don't know if Brian, if you want to walk back to the bar for a second,

303
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:23,083
but like how many how many drinks did you have to come up with for this game?

304
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:26,844
I don't think I can order another drink, but there were four right there.

305
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:28,305
They were very good ones.

306
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:33,326
I guess the question is how did you get to Captacom?

307
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:36,507
Yeah, I think after you stopped talking you might be able to.

308
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:41,449
But yeah, naming the drinks were a ton of fun.

309
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,770
Nice.

310
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,351
Just because I was sure I couldn't give them these horrible things.

311
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:49,591
Nice.

312
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:55,379
I want to jump back to chat real quick, and a quick reminder, we didn't stay at the top

313
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,021
I don't think, but if you have any questions specifically about game design or game development

314
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,582
in general, please throw them in chat and we will do our best to relay them.

315
00:22:01,683 --> 00:22:07,426
StatueSats are already on it, and they want to know again, this game reminds them of Valhalla

316
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:10,668
a little bit, so they want to know were there any particular games that inspired you or

317
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:10,988
the team?

318
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:21,460
It was definitely, I mean, for me, at least the two games I kept referring to in my head,

319
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:27,282
it was the Space Quest series from Sierra from the 90s.

320
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:30,843
And the old Sam and Max hit the road.

321
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:37,825
So these are two adventure games and they place a lot of emphasis on comedy and Sam

322
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:39,005
and Max in particular.

323
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:44,884
just the timing and the cartoon nature of it and those conversations between Sam and Max.

324
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:51,053
It's just, it's like movie level quality, just everything about that game.

325
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,817
And that was definitely like our bar that we wanted to hit.

326
00:22:54,947 --> 00:23:00,831
And the Space Quest series and the Monkey Island games, too,

327
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:05,714
they do a lot of fun things where they always kind of break the fourth wall and kind of poke at the player.

328
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:11,538
And we wanted to do that a lot with the Sister Mary Wormhorn character,

329
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:14,940
which I think you'll eventually see in this playthrough.

330
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,124
But this is the... she's the personal demon that you get assigned early on.

331
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,786
And she's there to kind of be...

332
00:23:23,555 --> 00:23:26,758
Poki in the games world, she's there to kind of be

333
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:30,762
Tormenting you in the hours. We are not being physically tortured

334
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:35,367
So that means that she brings up like your past and mistakes that you've made and will point out

335
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:41,953
Choices that that the player has done it kind of made and kind of makes fun of you just for even playing a game

336
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:48,876
So we really wanted her to kind of be that fourth wall breaking type.

337
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:53,819
So kind of like her and Satan are the only two characters in the game where they like know they're in a game

338
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,762
and kind of talk around it and kind of allude to that.

339
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:01,385
So those are two big kind of inspirations.

340
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:09,329
And we've talked about, you know, coming off of Oxenfree and like jumping into this.

341
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,011
But like, I feel like I don't want to gloss over the fact, you know, you guys did

342
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,533
at least one other big game project, which is the Mr.

343
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:18,776
Robot mobile game, which is like a significant thing.

344
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:22,038
So I'm curious, like, were there any things you learned in that process

345
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:24,640
or that production that influenced the way you approach designing this game?

346
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:31,084
Mr. Robot, it was a unique game in that it's that one.

347
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:35,067
We really wanted you to feel like you're just texting and to make it feel like

348
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:47,095
You are texting another human and that everything on your phone kind of should reflect that and it should be this very kind of seamless thing that you almost forget like you're playing a game. And with that one we

349
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:52,359
Yeah, we really kind of leaned into the actual physical act of that.

350
00:24:52,399 --> 00:25:06,282
So it's like, you'll see the text come in and you'll see like you, like you, the person that is choosing it, like you'll see him, like, make a mistake, you know, erase and then rewrite it again and, and really kind of play with just kind of how people talk on text versus how they talk in real life.

351
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:09,523
So if, if, if anything, it kind of.

352
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:18,067
Just like was a good exercise and just thinking totally outside of the box before jumping into another very real time thing

353
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,870
um, but yeah, and and two that was done for a um for an

354
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,553
External partner because of course we had partnered up with the mr. Robot team to kind of make that that game

355
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:31,315
Sure. Um, so just like hearing kind of what they

356
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:32,635
Were interested in

357
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:39,934
It was funny, like when we first started working on it, you know, like with Oxenfree, we, you know, we're kind of pitching our idea for this game.

358
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:48,561
I was like, okay, so it's all going to be on your phone, you know, text and, and, and like in Oxenfree, you'll be able to control the story and you'll have a million different endings.

359
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:52,785
And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we don't, we, no, Mr. Robot is a set thing.

360
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,246
You will not have multiple endings.

361
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,008
That's not a very specific end and a very specific thing.

362
00:25:57,328 --> 00:25:58,209
Like, oh, okay.

363
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:04,430
And in making that game, we're like, oh man, are people going to think it's boring if it's too straightforward?

364
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,652
And nobody really cared, they just thought it was a cool, fun thing still,

365
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:14,036
and you're able to make enough choices within it to still feel like you're picking apart the game.

366
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:22,542
So we took that lesson too in here and not focus so much on being able to,

367
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:26,404
every single thing you say, be able to branch and dovetail back and da-da-da-da, and just kind of...

368
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,671
focus on making just a really good story that you can...

369
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,713
Like, there are a lot of different kind of endings and halfway through

370
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:40,757
the game and after a party, it kind of leaves it up to what goal you

371
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:43,859
want to be. Not to spoil things, but kind of

372
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:47,601
changes from the beginning of what you just have to

373
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:48,301
get out of

374
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:53,764
hell. It kind of becomes more of a complicated, like,

375
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:55,645
and what do we really

376
00:26:56,774 --> 00:26:57,554
Right.

377
00:26:58,835 --> 00:26:58,975
Hmm.

378
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:00,236
So I wonder...

379
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:03,358
I was gonna say, hell seems to be getting in the way of our chat.

380
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:04,478
Making a really good plot.

381
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,079
Sorry.

382
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:07,200
It's okay.

383
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,621
Adam, real quick, are you on Wi-Fi?

384
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:11,062
I am on Wi-Fi.

385
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:12,623
Does your computer have an ethernet port?

386
00:27:13,344 --> 00:27:14,564
It does not.

387
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:17,566
F*** that.

388
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,168
We are summoning demons.

389
00:27:20,768 --> 00:27:21,248
Oh, really?

390
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:21,989
Yeah.

391
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:23,979
That's a good point.

392
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:28,782
Because actually, unfortunately, if I unplug it or move it, it'll just shut off because

393
00:27:28,822 --> 00:27:30,383
my battery is completely dead.

394
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:32,064
Yeah, let's not do that.

395
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,085
We'll muscle through it.

396
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:34,225
Okay.

397
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:36,127
Sorry.

398
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:37,587
I think we got the most of that.

399
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:43,291
Adam, I think we can...

400
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:44,552
I know you're game...

401
00:27:44,572 --> 00:27:47,594
I'm going to ask for your brain as a game director for a moment.

402
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,676
How do you and your team prioritize creating...

403
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:56,841
You know, I think like a lot of narrative games sort of struggle from in order to be truly compelling,

404
00:27:56,861 --> 00:28:01,385
they need to be end-to-end with content and end-to-end with interesting places to look in the

405
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:04,688
game. How do you and your team like sort of process like we're looking at standing in a

406
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:10,793
room now that like has a lot of unique stuff like the guitar, the art on the wall, the demons like

407
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,655
kind of mingling in the foreground and background, like the people I guess some of the people get

408
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:17,058
reused. But what's your studio's process for working as a small...

409
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:25,440
Small team and still making something that feels like it's loaded with personality and you're sort of able to trade on more than just words alone.

410
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:34,962
Yeah, we had to come up with a very smart system early on for just how to make a lot of characters.

411
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:45,724
So we kind of came up with this demon and human making toolkit where we were able to kind of make a lot of different heads and arms and legs and body types.

412
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:46,305
Kind of.

413
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,847
All right.

414
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:51,287
Almost.

415
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:58,269
And then for the bars themselves, yeah.

416
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:01,630
We just really tried to plan out things very well

417
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,330
ahead of time in terms of what each bar would need

418
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,631
and what each bar the feel would be in the art style.

419
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,352
And just make sure that we kind of stick to that.

420
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:13,852
And once we're sticking to that and not make a lot

421
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:16,153
of changes after the fact.

422
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:22,204
But yeah, because we're so small, I mean, we have a team of about four artists,

423
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:27,206
and yeah, they just had to make every single thing that you see in this game.

424
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:32,088
So we weren't able to, yeah, say like, oh, if it's not working in eight months,

425
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:34,549
we'll kind of like pivot and change things.

426
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:38,250
Like once we're kind of building things, we have to be confident that that's what we want.

427
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,012
So it was really just a matter of kind of making a really solid outline for the story

428
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:45,693
and an outline for the game mechanics and the overall design

429
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:46,353
are really sticking.

430
00:29:47,155 --> 00:29:51,877
Nice. What do you think makes a good story?

431
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:19,267
Because every story that he did came from something else.

432
00:30:19,307 --> 00:30:23,129
Which is what makes those stories great, or just how the characters put how they're feeling.

433
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,152
And I feel like that ultimately is what makes a good story.

434
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:33,176
It's just the... it's hyper-specific to what the writer or the team or the artist...

435
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:35,437
kind of wants to talk about or wants to say.

436
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:39,460
And having the characters kind of express that in a very way...

437
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,902
in a way that is unique to them.

438
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:49,659
And I'll kind of, I'll happily watch any story about anything as long as I feel like I'm

439
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:53,362
seeing new perspectives about the same old stuff.

440
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:54,063
Right.

441
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:55,304
That's so interesting.

442
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:59,448
I mean, that would seem to flow directly out of your work on Mr. Robot where that fear

443
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:06,534
about not having like a panoply of endings sort of like winnowed down and you focus more

444
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,416
on characters and character interaction and that kind of thing.

445
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,289
There's another question here in chat from Statuesat.

446
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:15,591
They want to know, like, so just what do you think about companies, game companies

447
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:17,853
specifically, pushing back on people

448
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:22,316
spoiling games, you know, like it's been a while,

449
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:24,858
but I think they're referring to stuff like when Persona 5 came out

450
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:27,419
and people were like, don't stream it, don't talk about it.

451
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,422
Ironically, they were limiting streams a lot, like which ironically said

452
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:33,544
is we're streaming after party and spoiling the second hour. Yeah.

453
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:37,107
You make narrative games, how do you feel about that?

454
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:42,118
Oh no, he froze.

455
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:43,078
Oh no.

456
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:45,779
The internet just shot him down.

457
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:46,279
He's like, nope.

458
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,860
Can't let these opinions get out.

459
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:55,182
Man, did the PR team jump in here and sabotage the stream or what, guys?

460
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:58,784
It's Halloween comes early today.

461
00:31:58,804 --> 00:32:00,004
Spooky internet.

462
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:02,645
I am cursed.

463
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:07,166
Adam, if you can still hear me, shoot me a message in Skype and we can try and reconnect

464
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:07,406
to you.

465
00:32:08,817 --> 00:32:11,358
Man, it's also kind of funny because his face just sort of froze.

466
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:12,358
This is really awkward.

467
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:13,799
In the meantime, what's up, chat?

468
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,019
How's it going out there?

469
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:15,940
How you doing? There's 15 of you.

470
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,921
Come on, Statue State can't be the only one with a keyboard.

471
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:19,781
Do you guys play this game? You like it?

472
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:20,282
Yeah.

473
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:21,402
Seems good.

474
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:23,263
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

475
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:26,184
Like I've been having to conceal my laughter over here

476
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:28,005
because I've been laughing out loud at some of the jokes.

477
00:32:28,745 --> 00:32:29,426
I'm serious, man.

478
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:30,826
Humor's really hard to do in games.

479
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:32,667
That's why this game, Outer Worlds 2,

480
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,508
like the writing and the timing, it's just...

481
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:35,669
Hmm.

482
00:32:37,629 --> 00:32:38,090
It's hard work.

483
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:48,175
I don't know. We're this we're this you just keep playing. Yeah, I see where this goes. Yeah

484
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:53,780
Maybe his laptop died. He could probably move it

485
00:32:55,801 --> 00:33:00,926
This is so wild never seen I'm just having a bad tick week probably got so excited about

486
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:04,328
Spoilers that he knocked his laptop over and it shut off

487
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,272
Let's give it a couple minutes. See if he comes back and then we can call it

488
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm just going to post a message.

489
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,441
You're going to see something weird on screen for a second, guys.

490
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:18,525
Do you think they ever get out of hell?

491
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:21,146
Oh! Oh, we're back!

492
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:21,646
Oh!

493
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:22,587
What's up?

494
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,109
Did something happen at your end, Adam, or did you just hear us, like,

495
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,731
talking for a couple seconds about how we couldn't hear you?

496
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:30,532
We, yes.

497
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:32,673
It was just the lead ad me shouting, like,

498
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:33,334
can you hear me?

499
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:34,474
Oh, no.

500
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:35,915
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:36,255
It's fine.

502
00:33:36,335 --> 00:33:38,357
No, I'm sure it's just because...

503
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:42,789
Because I'm in a very weird corner, so the internet is awful here.

504
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:48,492
But, um, so yeah, so the question was about the spoilers, right?

505
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:49,832
Companies restricting spoilers.

506
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:58,535
Yeah, so, um, so yeah, I definitely feel like, um, or I did feel at the beginning that spoilers

507
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:05,578
would naturally hinder, um, at least someone's desire to play a narrative-focused game if

508
00:34:05,618 --> 00:34:07,639
they're already seeing how the story is going along.

509
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:19,059
But my time at Telltale, when I worked there in 2012-2013, all of their market research

510
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,501
had actually showed the exact opposite.

511
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:25,606
That the more you show people what the story is, the more they'll want to apply, because

512
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:29,911
they'll want to make their own choices.

513
00:34:30,892 --> 00:34:33,394
I've actually heard that a lot from trailers too.

514
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:38,077
Us, the audience, complains a lot about trailers that give away too much.

515
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,101
But apparently, studies have shown that if a trailer actually gives away a lot, it makes

516
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:44,602
people want to see the movie more.

517
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:49,986
Which I don't really understand, but it's hard to argue with, I guess.

518
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:55,410
I personally am someone who's not really bothered by spoilers, in that I feel like if I'm hearing

519
00:34:56,082 --> 00:35:02,806
the big building blocks of a story. It's still not spoiling what I like about movies and books anyway,

520
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:08,791
which is again just the details and how the characters are talking and just the way that they get to those points.

521
00:35:10,172 --> 00:35:13,174
But yeah, I feel like

522
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:18,858
streaming and showing the game is really only a good thing and only a positive thing and

523
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,825
and the people who want to avoid spoilers can kind of do that at their leisure.

524
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:31,290
And that it's only kind of a bad thing if an article like springs a spoiler on you that you didn't want.

525
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,033
But just the act of showing the game early and showing the entire game,

526
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:40,498
honestly I think is only a way to kind of spread the word that the game is out there

527
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:41,659
and this is a thing that you should try.

528
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:41,759
Nice.

529
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:47,048
This is like a really outdated question, but I haven't talked to anyone about it in years.

530
00:35:47,068 --> 00:35:48,069
And I just wonder what it's like.

531
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:50,891
Do you remember like two years ago when Steam started doing refunds

532
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:54,353
and there was like a brief moment where everyone who made a game less than 50 hours

533
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:56,175
was like, oh, no. Yes.

534
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:59,337
Do you do is that ever still a concern for you and the team,

535
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,139
or did that never prove to be a real problem?

536
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,202
I think it was a concern mostly for

537
00:36:08,724 --> 00:36:12,487
yeah, games that were trying to get one over on you,

538
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,688
where it's like.

539
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:19,859
If you play it for a half an hour or 45 minutes and then you've seen every single possible

540
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:23,460
thing that that game has to offer, I might be concerned there.

541
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,582
But with a narrative game where you know what you're getting into and the people kind of

542
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:34,144
know what they're buying, yeah, honestly, it was never really a discussion with us or

543
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,825
a concern just because it just seemed something that...

544
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:41,954
It seemed mostly fair to us, just in a way of like,

545
00:36:42,114 --> 00:36:46,677
oh, if I was purely a consumer, that would be a thing that I'd be happy that I could do now.

546
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:50,359
And also just nothing that we could really control.

547
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:55,422
Like, it felt weird for us to almost have such a strong opinion about it.

548
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:58,424
Like, no, once you buy the game, there's no refunds.

549
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:01,086
No takebacks, yeah.

550
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:04,468
So, yeah, we honestly never really were really concerned.

551
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:17,262
I think one challenge for selling narrative games in 2019 is people are interested in

552
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:17,482
them.

553
00:37:17,642 --> 00:37:21,403
People talk, they get a lot of press, journalists are interested in them.

554
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:26,265
There is obviously demand, you see it on Steam, sometimes these things sell like hotcakes,

555
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,146
like you had Plague Tale Innocence earlier this year.

556
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:36,248
But I think the challenge for any narrative studio is that scaling and keeping costs and cost management works totally different than for other companies where,

557
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:46,291
if say your multiplayer game is getting bigger and bigger, you want to scale up to have people to fill roles to keep the multiplayer going, but narrative is definitely on a project basis, I guess.

558
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,631
There's less of a liveness to it, there's less of a...

559
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:57,637
What are your thoughts for running Night School, especially in a city like LA, and keeping it so that you guys can keep making games, you know, and keep making the next one even if after...

560
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:05,241
You know, Oxenfree seemed to sell well, you made your way to the App Store, I'm always seeing it featured in the App Store, which is probably a good sign, but I guess what are your thoughts about...

561
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:11,385
Making sure that when after party ship you guys wouldn't just be a two...

562
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:14,226
Well, I've been asking the question for a couple weeks because I was at a conference,

563
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:18,889
and before I was saying one game studio, but I guess now how do you guys make sure you're not a two game studio

564
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,510
and able to still work at the size you're at?

565
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,770
Yes.

566
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:28,894
Yeah, with a question this big of course there's a couple different factors that kind of go into it.

567
00:38:29,214 --> 00:38:35,017
For us I think primarily it's about making sure that we keep the studio as small and as lean as we can.

568
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,202
and we hire the people that are absolutely filling kind of multiple holes.

569
00:38:40,222 --> 00:38:44,364
Like everyone in the company wears a couple hats

570
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:51,508
and we all kind of take a lot of ownership and responsibility over the parts that we put in.

571
00:38:52,528 --> 00:39:00,453
So that just helps us, yeah, just with the overhead and just the amount of just heads in the office, of course.

572
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:04,575
But then too, it's kind of, it's also a combination of...

573
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:09,321
doing projects that we either have deals ahead of time with,

574
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,723
where we know if everything explodes, like the Mr. Robot game,

575
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:15,765
if nobody buys this at all, we still got paid,

576
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:19,287
we still got the money that we needed to keep the studio afloat

577
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:21,088
for those months and weeks and days.

578
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:25,151
And then also doing the projects like Oxenfree and Afterparty,

579
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:27,192
where we're funding it entirely ourselves,

580
00:39:27,252 --> 00:39:30,534
based on profits of other things.

581
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,116
And just making sure that we always have a balance of...

582
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:37,444
future checks coming in and making sure that

583
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,266
we just have kind of always multiple kind of irons in the fire,

584
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:46,047
because with anything, and particularly in L.A.,

585
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:47,188
it's like you can go on 100...

586
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:56,052
Whoops, Adam. We lost you after the word 100.

587
00:39:56,392 --> 00:40:01,394
That's why we started drinking. Everything slowed down.

588
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:08,599
Um, sorry, we lost you after 100.

589
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:08,939
Uh...

590
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,740
Meaningless...

591
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:14,181
Yee...

592
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:15,141
Yee...

593
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:15,201
Aw...

594
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:23,143
You guys are so stupid.

595
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:28,284
So haunted. We're so haunted.

596
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:30,005
If you heard...

597
00:40:31,738 --> 00:40:33,199
Did you catch any of that?

598
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,302
We lost you, as I said two times and I'm sure you heard, sorry, we lost you after 100.

599
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:43,385
Oh man, sorry.

600
00:40:43,405 --> 00:40:46,307
Did you get the response from that or no?

601
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:47,388
No, I'm sorry.

602
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,669
No worries, it's just the internet.

603
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:54,345
Normally this is fine.

604
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:59,608
So yeah, maybe the LA fires are creating a thing right now.

605
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,570
Yeah, no joke. Maybe like just this answer is cursed.

606
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,672
You want to just move on or you want to try after hundreds again?

607
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:06,293
Yeah, right? Yeah.

608
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:13,097
Well, the very short version of it is to just try and make sure that it falls apart.

609
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:17,420
We always have something else to kind of like keep the studio on.

610
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:19,882
That makes total sense. Yeah, for sure.

611
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:22,723
Maybe we can talk a little bit more about business if you're up for it.

612
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:27,205
I'm curious to know how the launch has gone and sort of like what you're thinking was

613
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:30,426
between putting it like I know it's on the Epic Game Store now and Steam.

614
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:34,948
Like how do you feel in general about where game store fronts are at these days

615
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:38,129
and what shaped your decision to put the game out where you did?

616
00:41:38,149 --> 00:41:44,932
Oh no. Oh no.

617
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:48,913
Well.

618
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:50,449
It's worth a shot.

619
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:54,832
Well, we're about to put on a dance show.

620
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,135
I'm sorry buddy, you cut up again.

621
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:02,236
It's a we lost you.

622
00:42:02,676 --> 00:42:03,857
It's just a frozen face.

623
00:42:06,098 --> 00:42:07,879
Oh boy, and I gotta hit some face pads.

624
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,680
It was the day before Halloween.

625
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:11,741
And all through the Internet.

626
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:13,522
I call up.

627
00:42:13,602 --> 00:42:14,343
Are we good?

628
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:20,854
We got a little bit of it. Yeah, we can hear you.

629
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,757
No, man, I'm playing DDR over here.

630
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:28,179
Yeah, that's looks fun.

631
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:36,085
So I yeah, I did not hear that question whatsoever.

632
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:39,647
Sorry. It was just like, you know, I'm curious to know how you feel about

633
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:42,449
the state of game storefronts these days and what shaped your decision

634
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:43,389
to put the game out where you did.

635
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:46,071
I noticed it's on EGS and Steam and console.

636
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,452
So how you feel in these days about.

637
00:42:47,883 --> 00:42:49,685
the visibility of indies and how is the game done?

638
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:52,127
Yeah, so the game is doing well.

639
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:59,113
I honestly have been kind of avoiding hearing too many details about what these sales are like.

640
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:10,282
I'm going to wait until this weekend, but I've just kind of tapped Sean, the other co-founder and studio head.

641
00:43:10,562 --> 00:43:12,003
Just like, is it going okay?

642
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:15,486
He's like, yeah, it's going great.

643
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,357
So it seems to be doing well.

644
00:43:18,377 --> 00:43:23,440
And I've been more focused to on the reviews as if they've been coming in.

645
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,661
But but yeah, but then in general, just about the storefronts,

646
00:43:28,702 --> 00:43:33,484
I definitely like can understand the complaints about having

647
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:37,806
that, like too many things that you just don't want to install on your PC

648
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:40,487
and have to deal with and like ways to get games and.

649
00:43:41,105 --> 00:43:59,895
And I feel like a lot of that is folding into the conversations now about, like, is it a good thing that there's like a Disney streaming thing and a Netflix and an HBO and an NBC and is, are we kind of getting to the point now where it's like people will start going back to cable just because it's an easier I just want it all just give it to me I'll just pay the one fee.

650
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:15,591
But at the same time, it feels like a minor hurdle to be able to really customize how you want to get your games and which games you specifically want and not have to kind of pay for something that you're not necessarily going to use or see.

651
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:27,674
So, yeah, my feeling is that the industry as a whole is generally moving into a better space than it was, and that you're just having more options now of just how you want to...

652
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:36,970
get things and there's definitely more options for the independent studios to just stay afloat,

653
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:43,015
where it feels like there are these massive, massive games like Fortnite that come out and

654
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:48,839
generate just untold sums of revenue. And then those companies are kind of able to use that

655
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,085
as a comfort and able to kind of take more risks and take more gambles on indie studios that they

656
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:57,427
want to support and put up more kind of

657
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:01,820
These are more just cooler, kind of experimental things.

658
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,981
And I've heard that's kind of the same way in the book publishing world, where it's like

659
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:09,842
something like Harry Potter and these giant massive books that we hear about

660
00:45:10,203 --> 00:45:13,183
kind of make like 99% of book sales.

661
00:45:13,683 --> 00:45:17,665
And that's what funds everything else, like the things that win all the prizes.

662
00:45:18,825 --> 00:45:21,786
So that kind of feels like what games are right now.

663
00:45:23,205 --> 00:45:26,627
And at least for right now, I can't really think of a better way to do it.

664
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,829
I mean, this is kind of what the public kind of jumps into and what these

665
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,552
these organizations and the companies and what the indies are able to kind of do

666
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:35,753
and how they're able to serve five.

667
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:40,356
But yeah, I personally feel like it's kind of arcing towards a good thing.

668
00:45:41,037 --> 00:45:42,378
Yeah, it's interesting. You mentioned the.

669
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:44,049
You alluded to cable there.

670
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:45,670
It's like people just want this big package.

671
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,032
And I hadn't really thought about it before, but there's a lot of that in games

672
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:51,475
now between Apple Arcade, Google Play subscription, the humble thing

673
00:45:51,495 --> 00:45:54,618
where you just get games every month and this whole like curated collection.

674
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:58,161
There really is more and more space for people who don't want to deal

675
00:45:58,201 --> 00:46:02,364
with having to sift through the marketplaces and just get a curated collection.

676
00:46:02,404 --> 00:46:04,706
Is that something that you'd be ever interested in doing with your games?

677
00:46:05,787 --> 00:46:06,548
Yeah, yeah.

678
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:09,651
I mean, we yeah, we're kind of always interested in

679
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,564
Even apart from the business aspect of just where the games are showing up, but just being in

680
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:22,210
a bunch of different ways that you'll experience it and just a bunch of different like place

681
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:28,896
dials like Oxenfree and Afterparty of course are meant to just kind of you sit down and you play

682
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:33,601
the game and you're there for an hour or two but it's interesting being yeah seeing kind of the

683
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:42,101
playstyle is much more, you kind of jump into this ecosystem of many games and you're maybe

684
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:45,864
expected to try one out for five minutes or play one for ten minutes and then hop out and come

685
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:51,368
back in and to really kind of think about what an interesting storytelling mode would be for that.

686
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:55,390
It's just an interesting like creative challenge.

687
00:46:56,335 --> 00:47:02,941
So yeah, we're just kind of always interested in just how to tell and how to kind of make these games just fit those

688
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:03,882
the

689
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:07,065
Delivery system and kind of the best way

690
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:11,229
Yeah, right on. I am we got about 10 minutes left in this haunted stream

691
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,832
So if you have any questions anybody get them in now

692
00:47:13,852 --> 00:47:20,138
I'm gonna get a question and then I'm gonna need to for timing sake because I'm unfortunately on a tight tight schedule today

693
00:47:20,952 --> 00:47:22,794
Brian, you have a question? Go ahead.

694
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:24,295
In the back there.

695
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:26,717
Man, um, uh,

696
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:28,758
Adam, my fascination

697
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:31,000
with your games is that you guys may do interrupting

698
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,701
really well. Like characters interrupt and talk

699
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:34,762
over each other in a way that when most of their

700
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:36,784
games do it, someone literally has to, they'll be

701
00:47:36,804 --> 00:47:38,765
talking and then, and then the

702
00:47:38,805 --> 00:47:40,046
next line of dialogue pops up.

703
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:42,928
Um, uh,

704
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:44,930
so, you guys do it a lot better.

705
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:45,490
How do you do that?

706
00:47:48,012 --> 00:47:48,873
Um, so the

707
00:47:49,377 --> 00:47:52,258
The sad answer is that there's just a lot of writing.

708
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:54,719
There really isn't like a trick to it.

709
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,801
Like, because how you make the interrupts work

710
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:03,163
is that you just put a ton of bookmarks in the conversation

711
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:06,164
so that what that means is that

712
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:11,246
when we know at any point you can cut off a line or cut off a thought

713
00:48:11,926 --> 00:48:15,167
that there just has to be three or four or five different lines then

714
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:18,608
that can feed right back into what they were saying.

715
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:24,148
So it's like if Milo is like, man, when I was six years old, and then you click on a

716
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:28,471
demon that you want to talk to and you have a minor conversation with him, that the game

717
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:30,892
kind of keeps track based on that bookmark.

718
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:34,874
And we'll know Milo wants to get back to talking about when he was six years old.

719
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:38,916
So let's go back down to the next kind of version of him talking about that.

720
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:42,978
That's in the that's that's in the in the sequence.

721
00:48:43,138 --> 00:48:44,158
So so then he'll say.

722
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:51,515
Anyways, I was talking about when I was six years old and if you interrupt him again, there's even more versions of him kind of getting back to that.

723
00:48:51,955 --> 00:49:00,942
So it's just a matter of just writing a lot of different versions of the same conversations and allowing the game to kind of dip in and out of any of them in any order.

724
00:49:01,402 --> 00:49:07,047
And just kind of keeping a kind of mathematical track of exactly what point in the overall story you're at.

725
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:13,567
Um, just cause for me it's a big thing that I never really want to hear repeating dialogue in the game

726
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:16,370
just cause it kind of breaks your immersion.

727
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,214
You get that a bit in After Party just cause you're able to kind of challenge demons to

728
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:26,879
beer pong and lose and you have to be able to reach challenge them in situations like that

729
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:31,322
where we just can't write infinite versions of okay again beer pong.

730
00:49:31,863 --> 00:49:34,365
So you'll just have to hear repeating stuff there but.

731
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:39,970
As much as possible, I like it to just feel like it's just a natural flowing talk.

732
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,333
But yeah, so you just have to write a lot, unfortunately.

733
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:48,670
We're sort of out of questions so I'm going to start wrapping things up.

734
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,792
Thank you everyone for joining us today on the GDC Twitch channel.

735
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:58,115
Oh, uh, oh, nope, Mince Words jumped in with a last second other questioner.

736
00:49:58,175 --> 00:49:58,756
Gotta answer it.

737
00:49:58,796 --> 00:49:59,476
Hi, Mince Words.

738
00:50:00,617 --> 00:50:03,998
They're curious if Adam has a philosophy about what kinds of stories Night School wants to

739
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:04,299
tell.

740
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:09,341
Axentree and Afterparty have similar protagonists with supernatural contexts and they wonder

741
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:12,523
if you see these as signature elements or if you have ideas about what else you might

742
00:50:12,563 --> 00:50:13,283
explore in the future.

743
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:23,231
Yeah, we always like genre blending stuff, so I don't think you'll ever see us make 100% comedy, 100% horror, 100% action.

744
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:33,218
Oxenfree was very kind of like a teen coming-of-age story that could very much be Stand By Me, except we added in weird, spooky, creepy horror things.

745
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:35,419
And it's a ghost story at the same time.

746
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,803
Afterparty could have just been, yeah, a bar crawl and you're just out with a bunch of random...

747
00:50:41,335 --> 00:50:45,096
people and you're getting out of college and you're thinking about what next to do, but we wanted

748
00:50:45,116 --> 00:50:49,957
again, something kind of crazy to add it. So we just put you in hell. So we're always going to

749
00:50:50,017 --> 00:50:58,039
kind of have kind of a mix of things and we just like the kind of counter balances that those make

750
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:05,461
and I personally like always like a and enjoy a mixture of tones and movies and books and things

751
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:09,622
where you're laughing and you're scared and you're crying and you don't know if you should be laughing

752
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:10,322
but it's kind of...

753
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:15,692
Funny and um, where it's just always kind of keeping you on your toes. Um, but yeah, we

754
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:19,875
It's kind of like things that um, yeah, just have a lot of

755
00:51:20,516 --> 00:51:25,260
kind of 80s spielbergian amblin entertainment like heart feeling at

756
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,324
The at the core, um, but that's that's that's probably always what we'll like aim at

757
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:36,288
Did I miss the taxi pickup or am I still walking towards it? That's my question

758
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:40,880
Oh, I think you're still, this is, this, this island you're on is huge.

759
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,902
I think this is it.

760
00:51:43,502 --> 00:51:44,203
Okay, cool.

761
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,385
Uh, Mintz, uh, Mintzwords, thanks for your question.

762
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:50,568
Um, uh, that was a really fun level of after party.

763
00:51:50,728 --> 00:51:52,289
Adam, thank you so much for joining us.

764
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:54,091
Sorry about the demons haunting our internet.

765
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:55,071
No, I'm sorry.

766
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:55,912
I am sorry.

767
00:51:55,932 --> 00:51:56,052
Yeah.

768
00:51:56,737 --> 00:52:00,360
I kept blinking in and out. I hope you understood ten words of that.

769
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,803
We got some good answers. We harvested content. We pardeemed our way out of hell.

770
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:07,264
Well, I'm still in hell.

771
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:10,406
And with that, I'm going to leave everyone to have a wonderful day.

772
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:13,928
If you are out there in the audience and you are yourself a game developer,

773
00:52:13,968 --> 00:52:15,069
we would just like to remind you that...

774
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,552

779
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:34,105

If you can't make it to the show, or otherwise just like making games, or like the topic of game development,

785
00:52:50,499 --> 00:52:54,883

00:52:55,223 --> 00:53:02,729
We're doing a rare two streams in one week this week, because tomorrow we're talking to the folks over at Obsidian about The Outer Worlds.

787
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,191
and we're actually going to have...

788
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:06,333
Oh, God, I hope we get their names right.

789
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:09,896
Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky.

790
00:53:10,296 --> 00:53:11,117
We've confirmed them.

791
00:53:11,577 --> 00:53:15,661
If you're here today, come back tomorrow because that's going to be really awesome and I'm

792
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:16,362
so excited for that.

793
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:18,023
With that, have a good day.
