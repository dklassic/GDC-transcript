1
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:08,402
All right, it's probably right about time to get started.

2
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:10,764
So let's go ahead and do that.

3
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,985
How's everyone doing today?

4
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:14,206
So good, right?

5
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,607
Yeah, you made it, it's Friday, you're still alive,

6
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:19,269
you should be proud, right?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,730
Hopefully we'll do you proud as well.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,651
I'm Roger Altheiser, I'm moderating this panel

9
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,452
with actually talented people.

10
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:28,074
And we'll start with introductions going from my right.

11
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:29,475
Hi, my name is Rachel Leiker,

12
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:32,257
I am the UI UX lead at Hardsuit Labs.

13
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,878
Hey, I'm Chris, I'm a content designer

14
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:35,278
on the World of Warcraft team at Blizzard.

15
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,492
Hi, I'm Vivian Wong.

16
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,915
I'm a technical designer at AtWat, as I call it.

17
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,316
Andrew Witz.

18
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:45,158
I'm lead in multiplayer modes and systems

19
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:45,959
at 343 Industries.

20
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:48,621
You guys announced a game last night, didn't you, Rachel?

21
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,402
We did, Bloodlines 2.

22
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:52,644
Ooh, that's gonna be a pretty good game.

23
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,606
Thank you, everyone.

24
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:58,349
You know it's a good game when you get another one.

25
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,690
All right, so introductions.

26
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,231
Let's talk real quick about that.

27
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,173
So you all have these great jobs.

28
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,434
How did you get to be you?

29
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,695
Let's do a real short one on that.

30
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,671
My background is in marketing and sort of content design,

31
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,532
and really I just kind of got bored with that,

32
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:14,312
so I decided to look into UI UX.

33
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:15,472
I went to school.

34
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:17,893
I got my master's degree at the University of Utah Entertainment

35
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:18,873
Arts and Engineering Program.

36
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:24,174
And from there, I sort of stumbled into a few jobs,

37
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:26,215
indie programs, things like that,

38
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:29,736
and then landed my first real gig at BossKey Productions

39
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:32,336
via networking, and then moved to Seattle

40
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:36,177
and applied out of the blue for Hardsuit and landed that gig.

41
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:36,217
So.

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:44,765
I actually started off doing GamesPress early on for a couple different websites.

43
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:48,549
One of them was Destructoid many years ago for about a year.

44
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,011
And then I'd always wanted to get into game development.

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,112
the cards kind of aligned.

46
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:56,234
I went to DigiPen, got a bachelor's there,

47
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,637
did a couple internships, one at Blizzard on WoW

48
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:02,198
and one at BossKey as well.

49
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:04,540
I turned into like a full-time gig,

50
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,201
shipped LawBreakers, rest in peace.

51
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:11,144
And then now I'm back working on WoW at Blizzard.

52
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:12,745
Hey Chris, how'd you fall into those internships?

53
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,986
People always ask me.

54
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:19,449
So when I was in my junior year at DigiPen,

55
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:27,612
We were all sort of hustling to try to figure out how we were going to get real big boy game design jobs after we graduated.

56
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:35,541
So my team and I, we all just started kind of working together to put out as many applications as we could.

57
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,226
I also was attending GDC, tried to talk to as many people as I could.

58
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:45,350
I think it's helpful to try to sneak into parties if you can, and you don't know anyone,

59
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,812
just don't be afraid to make friends while you're standing in line, even though you know

60
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:51,394
you don't have the invite.

61
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:54,896
And that actually did work out for me.

62
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:57,958
But your mileage may vary, so be careful.

63
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:02,861
And then same thing for BossKey, I just kind of applied for the internship, got a design

64
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,441
test back.

65
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:12,246
I did everything I could to research the role I wanted to go for and it managed to work

66
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:12,426
out okay.

67
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,688
Sweet, sweet.

68
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:20,771
Yeah, so I went to UC Santa Cruz's program for game design and...

69
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,391
Nice.

70
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:23,292
That's a great program, right?

71
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,786
It's pretty good, it's very CS focused,

72
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:29,088
so that's kind of the background I come from.

73
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:31,729
I struggled a little bit to get a job in the industry.

74
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:33,870
I kept coming back to GDC though, as a volunteer.

75
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,392
And eventually I got a design test set of that

76
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:40,394
and kind of became a content designer,

77
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,535
and then a level designer, and then a tutorial designer,

78
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:43,415
and now I'm a technical designer.

79
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:44,176
That's a lot of designer roles.

80
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:44,256
Yeah.

81
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:53,579
For me, I pretty much was making games on my own.

82
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,782
I have a bachelor's in creative writing, which was great.

83
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:02,026
It helped me kind of think differently from UMass Amherst.

84
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:08,031
And I kind of was working in startup tech in Boston

85
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,852
and while making games on the side

86
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:11,314
and learning how to program a bit more.

87
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:15,097
And finally, I was a digital media specialist.

88
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:19,522
and uh... i just really wanted to make games professionally i just like really

89
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,646
want to make is my hope is that somehow i would end up making games

90
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:25,890
professionally through uh... being a digital media uh...

91
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,354
uh... employee uh... didn't really see that immediately i was so hungry to kind of make

92
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:33,319
my own games uh... and uh... get paid for them the dream uh... and uh...

93
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,840
i went to uh...

94
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:41,947
University of Utah at the EAE program and I was there for about a year and I was hired by Ubisoft

95
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,989
after a year and

96
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:47,211
That was just for that was the year of making five games

97
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:54,417
simultaneously and I ended up getting my first gig as an internship at Ubisoft Montreal and

98
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:59,721
Then joined the Rainbow six siege team when it was just starting up. Yeah, I've heard of this game

99
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,506
Awesome. So we also want to talk not just about breaking in,

100
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,529
but what it's like to have a successful early career.

101
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,253
So rather than talking about like how you built your portfolio and got a job,

102
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:15,977
I'd like to talk about how your portfolio is now and what it does for you. Uh,

103
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:17,098
Vivian, you want to lead us off on that?

104
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,601
I have a very minimalist portfolio.

105
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:27,586
I basically just have my website and it has the four most recent games I've worked on,

106
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:33,671
my role, what technologies I use to make those games, and a brief description of the game.

107
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,933
I usually try and fit in a video.

108
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:36,714
That's about it.

109
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,120
Oh, nice.

110
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,660
I like it, right?

111
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,621
Nice and small and light.

112
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:43,863
Yeah, it's very, I try to basically create as less,

113
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:46,124
the least amount of friction as possible,

114
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:47,684
so people can really just high level

115
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:49,745
get an idea of my skills and what games I've worked on.

116
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,271
No, I actually think it's great.

117
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:52,632
I am never happy with my portfolio.

118
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:53,752
I am never happy with it.

119
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:58,814
I feel as though even if I just nailed it and I'm like, yeah, this is me, I'm just always

120
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:02,316
like this is not at all me at the same time.

121
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:07,618
It's just, I don't know, I'm always struggled with assembling my work and showing it off

122
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:11,559
because especially design, showing off the different stages and different things, it's

123
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,340
kind of a really difficult thing to do because you end up talking about it.

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,081
And GDC ended up being a really great spot to do that.

125
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,202
We all travel here to, hey, how did you do this thing?

126
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:21,162
How did you make this experience?

127
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:22,302
How are you thinking about things?

128
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:25,383
And you want to do that in a portfolio across the board.

129
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:27,603
It's like, what is your process and stuff?

130
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:31,344
And I feel as though it's hard to do that in a snapshot for

131
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:33,345
me, so I struggle to make them.

132
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:37,206
And a best practice I do is just start from the finished

133
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,106
product and work my way back, which is different from how

134
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:42,447
you see things, where you go from your original idea and

135
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:44,267
see how you failed till you got that thing.

136
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,470
So it's kind of an inverse thing for me.

137
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,030
It kind of helps me.

138
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,472
I still struggle with them though.

139
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:49,854
I don't know if I'll ever kind of like be like,

140
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,576
yeah, I'm an expert at portfolios.

141
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:52,897
Right, yeah, fair enough.

142
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:55,380
I was kind of in the same boat a bit too.

143
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,423
And like we actually had an assignment in school.

144
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:58,904
It was just like, build a portfolio.

145
00:06:58,904 --> 00:06:59,385
I'm like,

146
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:03,790
I don't know that I've ever seen really like what a design portfolio looks like.

147
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,231
Not sure how to structure that.

148
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:08,334
Started asking people like, hey, what do you look for in a design portfolio?

149
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,237
Got a lot of like, that's a good question.

150
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:12,258
What do we look like?

151
00:07:12,258 --> 00:07:14,120
We'll look for in a design portfolio.

152
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,142
So like clearly like I was lost.

153
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:21,127
People that were like hiring for the roles were also like unclear on what advice to offer.

154
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,129
So I started thinking about like.

155
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,532
I don't even know what an interview is like for a design position.

156
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:29,995
Oh God, I'm out of my depth, what do I do?

157
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:36,119
So I structured my portfolio as how would I want to experience an interview?

158
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:40,702
If I can give someone content to basically have

159
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:44,785
questions to ask me that I've already thought answers through for,

160
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:47,868
then that's how I wanted to set my portfolio up.

161
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,790
So I just put all my digital analog.

162
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:55,057
games, writing whatever that I thought was relevant,

163
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,318
kind of set it up into different categories.

164
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:59,260
And I've never actually culled any of my work

165
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,801
from the portfolio, so I like to have my homepage

166
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:04,743
sort of set up as like a linear progression

167
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,845
of like, here's where I was like X amount of years ago

168
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,167
versus like my most recent shipped products

169
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,068
and I kind of try to include some stuff that,

170
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:14,370
problems I solved so that if I get asked about them,

171
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,092
like I'm not floundering to come up with things

172
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:17,693
to talk about.

173
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,273
I like flounder portfolios and social media.

174
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:26,455
Yeah, so social media can actually enhance your portfolio experience quite a bit because

175
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:32,797
you can shoot out your pieces in a very succinct manner and people typically can grab onto

176
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:36,399
those things a lot easier than your traditional portfolio website.

177
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,780
So if you have an Instagram, if you have a Facebook, if you're on Twitter.

178
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,941
Just throw your stuff out there and you can make some nice color commentary about the

179
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,742
piece, kind of what you learned, your process, things like that.

180
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:52,163
And that can be both invaluable to employers, but also to other people who are kind of in

181
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,943
the industry or looking to get into the industry.

182
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,544
They can learn a lot from things like that.

183
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:57,944
Andrew, what are you doing with social media these days?

184
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:59,645
Talking about wrestling.

185
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:00,125
Nice, nice.

186
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,085
Actually, it's important though, right, to talk about that personal stuff.

187
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,708
Yeah, I think so.

188
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,051
I think who you are is, I mean, if you're comfortable

189
00:09:08,051 --> 00:09:10,553
with it, right, it's a big level of comfort

190
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:12,394
when you wanna talk about things that you think about

191
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,396
and your interests, I think that's really good.

192
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:18,179
It kind of helps develop, I think it helps build

193
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,142
soft skills with yourself, and so when you start

194
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:23,964
collaborating with other people, you can kind of know

195
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,046
how to start those conversations and get common ground

196
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:28,769
with people you work with, which I think is super important

197
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,171
for building that family aspect of a dev team.

198
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:33,712
And that's kind of how I've always worked,

199
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:34,953
is just kind of sitting down with people

200
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:35,693
and what are you interested in?

201
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:36,534
What do you do?

202
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,334
What games do you play?

203
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,255
It's all kind of the, it seems really easy.

204
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,736
This is like a very, like it's common advice,

205
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,098
but I feel as though it's really the best advice

206
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:46,139
is just, you know, talking to people

207
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,319
and then doing that for yourself,

208
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,401
of talk about things online that you're interested in

209
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,762
and really kind of elaborate on them and share those things.

210
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:57,487
I mean, that's why I kind of talk about wrestling a lot, is because I like it a lot and I think

211
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,228
about it a lot.

212
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:01,270
And it actually does help me in my game design.

213
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,692
But we'll talk about that later.

214
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:05,915
One thing to keep in mind with social media, though, is that when you do land your job

215
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:10,859
with a studio or a company, is to check their social media policies, because sometimes they

216
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,260
have rules about those kinds of things.

217
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,785
But also, it's good to kind of learn what the company's stance on certain things are.

218
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,825
so that you can either mirror those

219
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:21,466
or they can provide resources for you to talk about them

220
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:23,466
and that makes your job super easy.

221
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,567
Yeah, a lot of companies have policies about that

222
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,247
professional, personal, social media thing

223
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:28,768
that governs both sides of that, right?

224
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:29,428
They do, very much so.

225
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,748
You using social media at all?

226
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:32,089
I do, sort of.

227
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,589
On occasion?

228
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:34,529
On occasion.

229
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,370
I used to talk about Twitter Tuesday.

230
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,370
I used to be more active on Twitter

231
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,691
and I really just like retweet cool stuff

232
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:44,432
that I see other people tweeting about.

233
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:45,572
I kind of backed off of it a lot.

234
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:48,315
And again, it's one of those things

235
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,215
like your mileage may vary.

236
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,077
I think it's cool to build up your circle of people

237
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:55,057
that are doing things that inspire you

238
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:58,699
and try to connect with them in that way.

239
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,940
It makes breaking the ice if you wanna meet somebody

240
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,341
who you look up to at GDC a lot easier.

241
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:06,662
So that's kind of what I try to use it for now

242
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:07,843
more than anything else.

243
00:11:07,843 --> 00:11:10,664
That's a perfect segue into our topic on networking.

244
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,344
Vivian, he set you up.

245
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,025
Do you wanna talk about networking and how you do it?

246
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:19,436
I, for the longest time, still actually have a terrible time networking.

247
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:24,619
The thing that was really a breakthrough for me though was realizing that networking is

248
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:25,379
a skill all in itself.

249
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,143
I used to think that you were either just good at networking or you're bad at networking.

250
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:37,365
just not true. So that's another thing that coming to GDC every year has been so helpful

251
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:42,547
because you just get in the practice of kind of making those connections, making those small talk

252
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:47,348
conversations happen and then once you know what games like you have in common and you've played

253
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:52,010
you can talk about like, hey did you see this like cool event they designed? How do you think

254
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,512
they did that? Why do you think they did that? And you can make a lot of friends that way.

255
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:02,601
Yeah, I actually, I was not always a, I don't even think I'm really a good networker now.

256
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:06,723
I mean, I think I just, I like to talk about games a lot, especially games that I'm playing.

257
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:10,704
Anywhere I've worked, I kind of always just walk around the studio kind of asking people

258
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:14,146
like if they're playing the new game that just released or any, or what are people talking

259
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:14,446
about.

260
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:19,069
and or is anything that someone is playing and then if I don't know what it is, I immediately

261
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:22,292
start playing it at home or something just to kind of talk about it.

262
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,753
I think that's a great way to start.

263
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:29,818
I think there's always ways to improve being a good networker and especially inside of

264
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:30,539
your own organization.

265
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,902
Collaboration is really easy when you kind of know people and you get to know people

266
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:36,183
and you have a shared connection.

267
00:12:36,183 --> 00:12:37,404
Andrew, you got a personal story about that?

268
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:37,785
Yeah, yeah, sure.

269
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:37,905
So yeah.

270
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:50,068
I would say uh probably on Rainbow I was like number one moving to a new country. Canada is

271
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:53,930
not like super far away but Montreal uh being an English speaker as well. I'm not a good

272
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,052
French speaker at all. Uh and so it was at first I thought it was really daunting my first

273
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:02,695
year in the industry of you know this is my first uh triple A gig and also like I don't I'm

274
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:07,357
really worried about communication and I was kind of really nervous about that and um I was

275
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:10,159
uh really surprised at my dev my my my um.

276
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:14,142
team around me actually reached out to me really well and like you know really were talking to me

277
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:18,446
about hey what are you playing and I would say I don't play play new games lately because you know

278
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:21,609
I'm just starting I've been a student for a while but I am playing this mobile game and then all of

279
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:24,892
a sudden like my whole team was kind of playing the mobile game we were all playing it together

280
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:29,476
and then we started playing games a lot together as breaks you know like lunch breaks and stuff

281
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:34,341
and then like after work and like celebratory moments a lot of samurai gun was played by

282
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:35,802
rainbow six dev team a lot of samurai gun

283
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,484
That's awesome, that's awesome.

284
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,988
So this next topic could be like its own talk, right?

285
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,091
Applying, interviewing, and landing a job.

286
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:43,834
So we're gonna do like a little bit of a lightning round.

287
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,418
I want each of you to tell your best story

288
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:50,123
or worst story about applying for and landing a job.

289
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,545
Who's brave enough to go first?

290
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,671
I certainly will. So, uh, when I first interviewed at hard suit labs and they

291
00:13:55,671 --> 00:14:00,692
told me what the project was, which was bloodlines too, I fangirled out really

292
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:04,954
hard, like to the point where I was convinced I was not going to get that

293
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:09,495
job because they were just like, we cannot trust this person. And, but Hey,

294
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,936
I got the job and it was fine because they were looking for passionate people.

295
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,676
So, so that's not just a bumper sticker. They would say, oh, we want

296
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:17,937
passionate people. Yes, they actually did. And so I'm, I'm actually kind of

297
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:20,478
glad that I didn't turn myself down during that interview.

298
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:21,358
Did you show them your fanfic?

299
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:26,655
I was unprepared to show it.

300
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:27,756
They know about it now, though.

301
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,476
Andrew, go for it.

302
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,737
I think the interview that was most awkward for me was it

303
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,278
was a lunch interview.

304
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,719
I landed a lunch interview, and I actually spent the

305
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:43,660
majority of the lunch interview eating and not talking.

306
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,441
And so it was a lot of just like.

307
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:48,521
It was just a really big waste of time for that person.

308
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,062
I felt really bad, but I ate a lot because I was a student

309
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:52,082
and I was really hungry.

310
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:54,543
I was really hungry that day.

311
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:56,323
So that's actually a really good pro tip.

312
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:59,504
I actually had a recruiter once tell me,

313
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:02,684
tell all of your students to order salads,

314
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,485
foods that you can eat and still talk.

315
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,705
I'm so tired of people drinking soup during meetings, right?

316
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:08,925
Never get the sandwich.

317
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:09,906
Never trust the sandwich.

318
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:10,866
Never trust the sandwich.

319
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:11,806
Nothing that's gonna fill your mouth

320
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:14,026
and make you tell it real quick.

321
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:14,807
Evan, you got one for us?

322
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,822
My best interview was probably, I was hustling at GDC on the expo floor and this company

323
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:27,604
called Carbine was like, hey, we desperately need new content designers.

324
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:33,347
This was a Friday at GDC, I had been volunteering the whole week and I was deliriously tired.

325
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:37,549
So everything he said, I was just like, yes, absolutely, I can do that, whatever, it's

326
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:39,209
cool.

327
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,490
And I guess I was just so tired that I became confident.

328
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:45,109
exhausted into success.

329
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,290
He was so impressed.

330
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,652
He was like, I'm not even going to give you the design test.

331
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:54,658
I'm just going to like send you an offer later.

332
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:55,059
Wow.

333
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:55,379
All right.

334
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:56,961
So, so you CA your way into a job, huh?

335
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,823
You just work hard, get exhausted.

336
00:15:58,823 --> 00:15:59,403
I, um.

337
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,851
I was trying to think of a story that would be in line with what you guys are talking

338
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,132
about, but I'll take it from a different angle.

339
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:13,995
So something, as I've done more interviews, I've started to realize that I didn't realize

340
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:15,196
early on in my career was...

341
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:21,478
Interview them as much as they're interviewing you and don't be afraid to do that when you're like starting out

342
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:26,480
And you're really like hungry about like I just really want to get this job. It's my first job. This would be awesome

343
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,042
You don't really think about all the things that might be important to you once you're doing that job

344
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:37,284
And like what could be deal-breakers for you and what may might make your life miserable and kind of rob you of

345
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:41,765
All that like passion. It's it's a hard job to get into so don't

346
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,094
don't discount yourself.

347
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:48,597
And so I had an interview where I got through the whole thing

348
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,739
and halfway through, I realized, hey, this job's not really

349
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:52,159
for me.

350
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,321
I don't want this role.

351
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,022
I don't think I would jive with the team.

352
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,723
I don't think I would be passionate about doing

353
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:58,883
the work.

354
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:00,584
And I still went through the interview.

355
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,486
I wanted to see how everything unfolded.

356
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:05,728
And at the end of it, my...

357
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:13,394
my initial suspicions were pretty much like confirmed when we talked later and it was it was cool because I didn't feel bad to get the

358
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:17,577
The like rejection letter it was just like nope this this all makes sense

359
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,479
and so that's something that I would um

360
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:24,783
Like strongly urge you to always keep in mind as you are dealing with interviewing is don't just um

361
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:27,345
Kind of grab the first thing that like comes back to you

362
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:34,572
Uh, really sort of think carefully about it before you dive into something that could be a multiple year endeavor. Um in your life

363
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:35,809
What's it like now?

364
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,271
So you're not first jobbers now, right?

365
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,315
You're all like seasoned and hardened

366
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:43,298
and like rough and tumble veterans, right?

367
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:45,381
So what's it like looking around now?

368
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,283
Like some of you have changed jobs, some of you haven't.

369
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,865
For those of you who have,

370
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:50,888
what's the difference in the process?

371
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,129
I think the, I think.

372
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,603
Going off of what Chris just said, that's something that I think thinking about how

373
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:02,525
you go in, particularly in an interview, but I think it goes with everything else, is that

374
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:07,607
think about what you want, but also be okay to ask questions.

375
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:12,309
I feel as though that's one of the best things that ended up in my maturity in this industry

376
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,011
was just wanting to ask questions.

377
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,512
Because it seems really scary, because asking a question in a lot of ways kind of...

378
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:22,436
it already tells somebody, or your brain kind of tells you that, oh, if you're asked a question,

379
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,379
then they know you don't know something. So that's why you're asking it. And so the premise

380
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:32,325
is really terrifying, right? Asking a question is immediately terrifying. If you normalize that,

381
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:35,027
and kind of, you know, just, you know, the terror is always going to be there,

382
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:36,849
but always be comfortable asking questions.

383
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,631
Because when you ask questions, that's when you learn,

384
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:40,732
and you learn a lot easier.

385
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:43,174
And always ask questions to your teammates,

386
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:45,656
in an interview, anytime.

387
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:48,138
Always ask questions if you want to know the answer to something,

388
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:49,119
if you don't know something.

389
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,840
Acknowledging you don't know something, I think,

390
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,442
is probably one of the most powerful things

391
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:55,404
in being more mature in this industry.

392
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:58,466
Whether it's with tools, or just you don't even

393
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:01,148
understand a new genre, a design, anything.

394
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,230
It just helps you learn a lot faster,

395
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,051
because the premise of the question is,

396
00:19:05,051 --> 00:19:06,092
I want to learn this thing.

397
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:07,013
And you seek out that information.

398
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:10,286
What's a scary question you've had to ask like what's what's an example something like that?

399
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,182
I would say one of the scariest questions is, you know, when you don't know how to implement

400
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:18,024
something. I would say for a designer, like for me, I think the hardest question I had

401
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:22,106
was there was something that I was just like, I was assigned a feature and you're like,

402
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:25,988
and you kind of know what you want to do and you go, all right, I want to build this thing.

403
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:30,351
And then your next step is you kind of want to say, how do I, how do I build this? Yeah.

404
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,412
Right. Cause it's almost just like, all right, am I not the right person to build it? But

405
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:37,214
I'm excited about it and I want to do it, but it just kind of saying, I'm being comfortable

406
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,576
saying I don't know how to do this.

407
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,838
And saying that to your team is a very terrifying thing.

408
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:46,481
But when you say that, and you explain what you do know

409
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:48,663
about it, and you explain your design, that becomes a

410
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,084
collaboration, a collaborative moment

411
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,405
between you and your team.

412
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:55,188
And if you and your team are close, you'll find that

413
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:57,549
people want to support you because you're a team together.

414
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,772
that they will actually, you know, they'll work with you

415
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:03,094
and they'll work through that problem with you

416
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,116
and you'll educate each other on the way.

417
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,057
And so I think like, that's the most terrifying thing

418
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:09,039
for me is just saying, I have a great idea.

419
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,719
Great, what is it?

420
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,880
It's this, oh, that's a good idea.

421
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,381
Yeah, I have no idea how to do this.

422
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:13,287
That's awesome.

423
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:14,188
That's awesome.

424
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,988
Yeah, I don't have an idea how to do most of the things I do.

425
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:17,389
All right.

426
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:20,469
So let's talk a little bit about surviving and thriving.

427
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,310
That was intended to trip me up, wasn't it?

428
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,491
So we, how's it go?

429
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,771
We live to work or we work to live, right?

430
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:28,952
That's the tension, right?

431
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:31,373
So you're doing this thing and you want to be happy, right?

432
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:34,213
What are some keys to being happy in this career?

433
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:36,974
Like specific ones, like not general advice.

434
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:41,015
Like what are things that you are doing so that you are happy in your job?

435
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:49,292
One thing that I like to do, and I also express this to my team, is be really explicit about

436
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:54,515
where you would like to be in the future, either at a company or just personally, professionally,

437
00:20:54,515 --> 00:20:57,917
and articulate those things to your leadership.

438
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:04,441
Because a lot of the times, to them, it indicates that you are willing to stay on and that you

439
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:07,503
are comfortable here and you want to proceed.

440
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:14,027
And it also gives them a chance to help you develop your tool set, help you learn software,

441
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:19,171
help you with interpersonal skills, whatever your particular dream or progression wants

442
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:23,914
to be, they will be invested in you and that is a very important thing.

443
00:21:23,914 --> 00:21:25,435
Yeah, your managers want to mentor you.

444
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:25,615
Yes.

445
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,156
They want to hear that you're hungry to grow.

446
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:27,816
Yes, very much so.

447
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:28,957
Well, how about the rest of you?

448
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:32,499
What's something you're doing right now to make this career something you enjoy doing

449
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,440
that you want to thrive in?

450
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,800
I would say...

451
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:42,647
It's easy if you dive in head first and you're kind of fresh

452
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:46,729
and you're not sure where you want to end up with your role.

453
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:49,411
If you're a designer, there's so many different ways

454
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,492
that you can go with that.

455
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:51,612
There are lots of sub-disciplines.

456
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,833
So it's helpful to kind of identify early,

457
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,295
not just maybe what work you need to do,

458
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,376
but also what work you really enjoy doing

459
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:00,977
that gets you fired up.

460
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:05,470
So if you're really, uh, uh, look at you fired up with an example that for you,

461
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,216
like, so, uh, so for me, like, I think, uh, solving really challenging problems,

462
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:13,980
uh, in systems and gameplay in particular, uh, is super cool.

463
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,626
I think, uh, that sort of stuff is what pushes our medium forward.

464
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:20,227
And so if you can.

465
00:22:21,428 --> 00:22:24,010
like find an opportunity to grab onto something

466
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,972
that you're like, oh man, I really wanna work on that,

467
00:22:25,972 --> 00:22:28,834
and you can express that to other people on your team

468
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:32,076
and find a way to collaborate on that thing,

469
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:34,598
you're gonna do some of your best possible work

470
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:37,439
if you can put yourself into that situation.

471
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,322
And you're gonna feel more confident in your skill set

472
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:43,784
after you've successfully completed that thing,

473
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:44,925
you're gonna have learned a lot,

474
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:49,067
and you're gonna have seen the end result of your action

475
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,168
in players' hands, and you're gonna be like,

476
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:50,368
oh.

477
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:55,632
okay, like I feel better as like a designer or programmer or whatever, um, now that I've

478
00:22:55,632 --> 00:23:00,235
like completed this thing and that just continues to build upon itself like the longer that

479
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:03,858
you, uh, you're doing your job for. Awesome. We're going to do three minutes. We're going

480
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:06,840
to go to the next slide then we'll get to it. Okay. Unless you got a story, right? You

481
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,441
got a burning story?

482
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:11,159
I would just add to that is just learning how to give good feedback is a really big

483
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,701
thing on how to survive and thrive.

484
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:18,966
I would say learning how to give feedback really shows where you are.

485
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:22,630
Always assume people are coming from the best position and then asking them where are they

486
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,393
coming from and then when you give feedback you can kind of give that as a razor whether

487
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:30,457
or not that feature or thing is kind of at the bar that you want that they do expect

488
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:30,678
it to be.

489
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:34,141
So, that's one of the... it can be a whole talk, but like...

490
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,842
What's the secret sauce of you giving feedback real quick?

491
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:38,965
Like, you're really mean, like you kick them and give them feedback?

492
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,106
No, no, never, no, not that at all.

493
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:43,289
So, I would say that one of the...

494
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,972
the best thing is just have a conversation with somebody and ask somebody.

495
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:47,093
If you're playing something...

496
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,594
or if you're working a feature,

497
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,255
what do you think is the best scenario for this feature?

498
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:54,077
Because then you get educated about

499
00:23:54,077 --> 00:23:55,317
where that feature's gonna go,

500
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,298
and then what are the goals for that feature?

501
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,319
Then when you give that feedback,

502
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,980
you can give it in alignment with that versus,

503
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,501
this is, I just don't like this.

504
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:05,023
This is just, why would I, why is this in the game?

505
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:07,404
Like, you know, that's kind of this feedback loop

506
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,486
that we call, as players, we all kind of wonder these things

507
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:12,507
and then go back to being a player and not as a dev, right?

508
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:15,508
It's really good to maintain that dev perspective.

509
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,071
And not lose the player perspective.

510
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:20,274
It's always good to say, I don't understand something.

511
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:21,475
Yeah, fair enough.

512
00:24:21,475 --> 00:24:22,517
Vivian, I got one for you.

513
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:22,697
You ready?

514
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:23,178
Uh-oh.

515
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:23,398
Yeah.

516
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:25,300
It's the big one, right?

517
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,223
Plotting your career.

518
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:30,066
Looking at where you are and planning your future.

519
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:30,807
What do you do?

520
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:34,912
So I'm a notorious meanderer.

521
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:42,857
I didn't really know what I wanted to do, which might be obvious based on my career

522
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,137
trajectory.

523
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:49,919
I was kind of just happy to do whatever came across my plate.

524
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,200
And I think that's kind of the one thing that's changed recently in my career is I found technical

525
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,100
design and I think it's really clicked with me.

526
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,781
Especially when it like makes sense.

527
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:02,781
I used to do tech in theater and I love solving problems for people.

528
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:08,243
And I also used to make a lot of macros when I played WoW

529
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:11,344
so that I didn't have to press as many scary buttons.

530
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,304
So it kind of all...

531
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,265
Oh, and also, this is my favorite one.

532
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,866
When I played Dragon Age Origins,

533
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:20,567
and in combat you could program your allies

534
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,727
to do certain things at certain points in the battle.

535
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,848
I just didn't play combat anymore

536
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:28,609
because I just programmed my allies to be perfect.

537
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:29,670
Yeah, you're a technical term.

538
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:33,918
That sounds about right.

539
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:34,579
Awesome.

540
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,121
My place.

541
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,567
Who else has a ... So we've got like a minute left before we open it up to questions.

542
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:43,734
Who else has a tip on plotting your career, taking stock of where you are and planning

543
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:44,254
for the future?

544
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,658
I think I have one, and I'll be short.

545
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,859
One thing that I like to do with pretty much

546
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:50,920
every aspect of my life is learn as much as I can

547
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,541
about something that is not my discipline.

548
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,502
And I don't have to go into in-depths

549
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:58,363
about like AI planning or anything like that,

550
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:01,185
but just having base knowledge of those around you

551
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,966
really helps with pretty much everything.

552
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:04,747
So get involved.

553
00:26:04,747 --> 00:26:06,227
Yeah, I couldn't agree.

554
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:08,429
We should always be learning,

555
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:10,730
but always learning on the job is, yeah,

556
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,790
it's pretty valuable.

557
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:13,730
All right, we want you to keep in touch with us.

558
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,810
We're gonna open up for questions.

559
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,291
We have like a couple minutes to answer some questions

560
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,412
so we don't run over.

561
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,373
But you can also reach out to any of us.

562
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:22,394
We are all happy to chat with you at any time.

563
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:24,354
This community is all about that networking

564
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,435
and so we are all about that as well.

565
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:28,256
If you would like to ask the panel a question,

566
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:29,657
please step up to the mic.

567
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:33,238
Bonus points if it is a question and not a speech.

568
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:35,820
Triple bonus points if it's a short question

569
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,980
and not a question that requires you

570
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,441
to give your resume before asking it.

571
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:40,182
All right, who's got the first one?

572
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,622
We're gonna go over here.

573
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,269
All right.

574
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:43,629
OK.

575
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:45,311
That's good distance.

576
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:47,853
So I'm a first year student, and I always hear this word

577
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,294
networking, networking, networking.

578
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:53,357
Can you give me an example of what a short, simple, hi, my

579
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:55,898
name is blank, and I'm trying to network with you, but not

580
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:57,019
be obvious about it?

581
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,500
Can you try and give me an example of that?

582
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:06,935
Oh man. Can you even answer it? Honestly, I would just be explicit about it. Like, I

583
00:27:06,935 --> 00:27:12,900
think that networking shouldn't just be about like, hey, I really love 343. What jobs can

584
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,962
you offer me? Like, that's the only, in my opinion, that's the only wrong thing you could

585
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:20,485
do in networking. But if you just say like, hey, I'm trying to network, make connections

586
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:24,688
in the industry, I think people who are interested in making those connections with you are like

587
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:26,149
more than happy to keep talking.

588
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:27,857
It should be organic.

589
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:31,019
Like, don't like brute force networking, right?

590
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,120
I hate the term networking in and of itself,

591
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,261
because it just sounds bad.

592
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:38,363
Just go to game-related things and make friends with people.

593
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,784
And if you have a tough time doing that,

594
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,386
figure out what your social lubricant is.

595
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:47,168
People often suggest alcohol, but it does not

596
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,489
have to be that at all.

597
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:51,010
Don't think that it does.

598
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,171
I think that's probably not great advice.

599
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,795
So if it's like you're at like a Smash Bros tournament or something,

600
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:00,937
or you see somebody wearing a t-shirt that's a game that you like,

601
00:28:00,937 --> 00:28:01,978
that's your in.

602
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,880
And then if the conversation isn't working out,

603
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,523
then learn how to gracefully exit it.

604
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:10,065
And if it does work out, then keep in touch,

605
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:13,128
and those relationships will build up over time.

606
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:16,530
And I think that's kind of like what a lot of us have experienced

607
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,453
as we worked at different studios as well.

608
00:28:19,453 --> 00:28:21,134
Yeah, like, don't brute force it, dude.

609
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:25,579
I literally had a student land his first job by walking up to somebody and say,

610
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,201
I know I'm blowing this moment,

611
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:30,625
can you help me not blow the next one?

612
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,828
Any tips at all, you don't need to remember me,

613
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:33,969
and then they went to lunch.

614
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:37,693
So I think that trying is also a big part of it. It's a great question.

615
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:38,534
Thank you very much.

616
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:45,719
So, Chris, I'm in exactly the position that you were a few years ago when you described,

617
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:50,841
I'm a junior at DigiPen trying to finish and refine my portfolio, and I don't know what

618
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:53,082
people want on a design portfolio.

619
00:28:53,082 --> 00:28:58,484
For all of you, what do they want to see on a design portfolio, more specifically a systems

620
00:28:58,484 --> 00:28:59,344
design portfolio?

621
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:00,486
Oh man.

622
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:08,513
I would say, so, there's no great answer for this, obviously, but I would say what I look

623
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:16,660
for, you know, whenever I'm hiring designers or a system designer, is I usually like seeing

624
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,742
the, like, the most recent projects.

625
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:22,043
and a short description of the project,

626
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,383
and then exactly what you did,

627
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:26,024
and anything that can breadcrumb me

628
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,205
to kind of find out what that project is.

629
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,165
Because then there's some common ground

630
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:30,446
for me to ask some questions, right?

631
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:32,646
You kind of like, it's common ground for me to kind of go,

632
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,527
oh, this game's really cool,

633
00:29:34,527 --> 00:29:36,708
okay, they've had a lot of experience in this kind of game,

634
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,448
or this kind of game,

635
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:38,488
they'd be great for this,

636
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:39,889
this seems like this is a strong suit.

637
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:43,390
Those are all opportunities for me to ask you questions

638
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,951
about what, am I right in this is kind of what you want to do,

639
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,491
the systems you want to design.

640
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:50,052
Are you an expert in this?

641
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:52,374
Do you want to be an expert in something else?

642
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:57,439
It's more of a call to action for me to ask questions to you about what you want.

643
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:59,961
And so if it's a great fit, then awesome.

644
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:03,985
And so I would say start there of like, of think about of breadcrumb there.

645
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:08,428
If you have a really great system that you've had or a really great prototype, having a

646
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:12,712
video or a playable or anything like that is definitely bonus points, like absolutely

647
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:13,173
bonus points.

648
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:18,889
I would also say that a lot of these things, it's sort of a great lie where people say

649
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:21,051
these are the tips to do the thing.

650
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:22,612
That's not how dev works either, right?

651
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,074
We iterate and we test and we iterate and we test.

652
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:28,017
So he's talked about system designers, so the best advice is actually

653
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,178
to pull out your phone and after this talk,

654
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:32,320
meet him across the hall and show him your portfolio

655
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,701
and have him tell you what's wrong with your portfolio

656
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:37,103
rather than saying this abstract principle

657
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,125
to this to my portfolio.

658
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,647
Show people and people are receptive to

659
00:30:41,647 --> 00:30:43,028
what's wrong with my portfolio.

660
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,969
And they'll straight tell you.

661
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,210
We have one minute left.

662
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,492
If you have the world's quickest question, we can do it.

663
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,273
What can students and young developers do

664
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:52,014
while they're still growing their skills

665
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:53,776
to kind of plant the seeds for their career

666
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:55,597
when they actually have them?

667
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:56,158
Ship games.

668
00:30:57,118 --> 00:30:57,338
Cool.

669
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:59,361
No, make them small.

670
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:02,424
The biggest mistake that students make is they make things too big.

671
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:06,870
The first games you should be making, you should be getting them done in a week, right?

672
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,553
And then you can grow to a month, and then you can grow to a year.

673
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:10,614
But get some things done.

674
00:31:10,614 --> 00:31:11,275
Who else has stuff?

675
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,832
Yeah, I definitely agree with that.

676
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:16,174
My first game that I made collectively

677
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,957
was about a sentient piece of cheese

678
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:21,418
that ran around a railroad.

679
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:23,740
And we made that in a week, and it was a 2D game,

680
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,041
and it was ridiculous.

681
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,544
But that was really hard, and we made it,

682
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:31,787
and it was a playable, and we had like two levels.

683
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:38,032
The pains of making that game actually set me up for how I wanted to get better and learn more things.

684
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:47,020
Show off a really polished core mechanic or system or something that defines your game and makes it fun and just end it there.

685
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,462
Don't try to blow it out of the water on your first try.

686
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,164
so we don't get railroaded out of here.

687
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:54,165
Railroad, cheese, railroad, blah, blah, blah.

688
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,226
Yeah, it's a great song.

689
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,346
We're going to be across the hall,

690
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:58,627
and we're happy to answer any questions you might have.

691
00:31:58,627 --> 00:31:59,548
Hey, thank you so much for coming.

692
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:00,689
We really appreciate it.

693
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:03,210
Remember to fill out the form and vote on those things.

694
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,811
It's radically important.

695
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:05,771
You're beautiful and awesome.

696
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:05,831
Bye.
