1
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:13,779
Welcome everyone to level and quest design collaboration from Skyrim to Starfield.

2
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:19,780
We're going to be talking about the ways that different areas of design can work together.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,461
Your own studio might divide up work very differently.

4
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,142
You might have a narrative department.

5
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:29,343
Quest design might do something very differently from level design.

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,927
Level design might be doing more quest design.

7
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:33,550
Everyone does it a little bit differently.

8
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:39,180
But as long as your studio has two or more designers, this talk will have something for you.

9
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:41,915
So I'm Will Shen.

10
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:45,236
I'm the lead content designer for Something Wicked Games.

11
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:52,539
We are a startup with veterans and leadership from Bethesda Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment.

12
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:58,121
Prior to Something Wicked Games, I was a design director at Bethesda Game Studios.

13
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,102
I came up primarily in the quest design department.

14
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:04,824
And by the time I was leaving Bethesda Game Studios, I was working with the

15
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:11,449
next generation of design leadership there with Lead Systems, Quest, and Level reporting up to me.

16
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:18,435
Hey everybody, I'm Daryl Brigner, world director and one of the co-founders of Soft Reigns.

17
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:25,300
We're a small studio of 15 right now, coming from places like Riot, Valve, Sucker Punch, and Sledgehammer Games.

18
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:32,246
We're still early in production of our first title, which is a single-player, first-person sci-fi adventure game.

19
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:42,410
where, when I was at Bethesda, I was primarily a level designer during my time there, but I was also lead level designer on Fallout 4, Far Harbor, and also Fallout 76.

20
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:53,708
So Daryl and I have worked together over a very long career at Bethesda Game Studios for almost 15 years, together before we both left.

21
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:02,134
And this talk is going to be a retrospective of a lot of our work together, both with each other, but also a lot of our former colleagues.

22
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:05,457
We're going to be talking all the way back to Skyrim.

23
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:06,637
of the game.

24
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:25,782
So what do we mean when we talk about quest and level design?

25
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,125
Every shop does it a little bit differently.

26
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:32,770
So let's go over what we mean for our talk, for our purposes.

27
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,358
So this old-timey oblivion picture here is to sort of remind us that we are talking about the past.

28
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:43,901
Darl and I no longer work for Bethesda Game Studios.

29
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,082
They may do things very differently now.

30
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:53,588
But in the course of our career there, which spanned over 15 years, this is what we generally meant when we talked about quest and level design.

31
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:58,572
So quest design handled dialogue and text, what a lot of places call narrative design.

32
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:05,378
But we were also in the booth with the voiceover actors and directors to provide them with context.

33
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,420
Sometimes we would be in there for the entire session.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,523
We also handled a lot of the scripting, specifically to make sure that quests move forward.

35
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:19,446
So whenever an objective appears on the screen, that is usually quest scripting telling it to progress.

36
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:26,109
We also worked with all of the NPCs to have them walk around, to come up to you, to speak to you.

37
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:32,512
And finally, the quest design department at Bethesda Game Studios was also the systems design department for a long time.

38
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:35,634
There was no separate systems design department until

39
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:47,017
a few years before we left, and typically what systems design would be would be there would be specialist quest designers who would do the systems design duty.

40
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:55,499
When it came to level design on previous Bethesda games, if there was a location in a Bethesda game, typically a level designer owned that location.

41
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:05,602
There can be outliers to this with places like settlements and towns that can often be owned by quests and supported by world art, but typically if there's a location, a level designer is owning it and doing passes through it.

42
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:12,262
We're also ultimately in charge of the kit pieces and the logic that puts them together, since this is how we build out our locations and our layouts.

43
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:18,726
We work really closely with WorldArt when coming up with the logic and the systems that define the kits.

44
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:24,325
We share responsibilities with Quest when it comes to AI behavior.

45
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:29,549
Our stuff often tends to be on the side of moment-to-moment gameplay and kind of default behaviors.

46
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,651
How does a creature react if he's just dropped in the world with no other linkage?

47
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:36,173
How can we quickly set him up for patrols or wandering behaviors?

48
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:40,556
We are in charge of most all the combat encounters in the game.

49
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:45,299
Either we own it and are doing passes on it, or we had a hand in layering the combat into a space.

50
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:48,493
We do a lot of environmental storytelling.

51
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,274
We're ultimately in charge of how it's done in our location.

52
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:56,536
But we work very closely with World Art when it comes to detailing out our locations to tell these stories.

53
00:04:57,637 --> 00:05:04,019
And we do a lot of gameplay scripting, whether it's setting up systems to have our gameplay triggers affect other gameplay objects.

54
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:05,960
We'll share those amongst the rest of the design.

55
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,723
We also do a lot of unique gameplay scripting within our own locations to either add more to the story or make it more memorable in some way.

56
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:28,717
And when it came to collaboration between level and quest on previous Bethesda games, level design is in charge of the location, all of the combat NPCs, and any layout decisions that might come up during collaboration.

57
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:36,001
Whereas quest design is in charge of all of the narrative, all of the non-combat NPCs, and any story decisions that might pop up.

58
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,512
So now let's take a typical example of this kind of collaboration in action.

59
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,612
So let's go back to Skyrim.

60
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:49,533
Specifically, we're going to take a look at a quest called the House of Horrors.

61
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:52,394
This was in Skyrim in the city of Markarth.

62
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:55,835
I worked on this quest with a level designer named Dee Langlois.

63
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,796
And it's a very simple concept.

64
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:00,237
You are being asked to investigate a house.

65
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,737
The house ends up being haunted.

66
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:04,238
There is an evil presence that comes from the basement.

67
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:08,321
So quest design here handled all the dialogue.

68
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,224
There is a primary character that is leading you through the house, so I did all of his dialogue.

69
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:17,468
I also handle all of his behavior, so he comes up to you and he walks you through the house.

70
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:24,293
And when the quest comes up and tells you that it has started and it progresses, that is all the scripting on my end.

71
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:29,718
Dee was handling layout, but also the scripting for the haunted objects.

72
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:35,183
So all the poltergeisty effects, the camera shake, that was all handled by Level Design.

73
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,086
And I want to mention art as well.

74
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:43,931
We had a few unique assets for the space, including the altar in the basement that also functions as a trap.

75
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:50,337
There is a unique animation for it, and we also did a pass on the lighting and fog effects inside the space.

76
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,654
But let's take a closer look at how it was made collaboratively.

77
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:02,442
So the main character in the quest is from a faction in the game called the Vigil of Stendarr.

78
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:06,186
That faction was actually originally concepted by Dee.

79
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:11,292
They were working on other encounters in Skyrim and

80
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:12,053
I'm

81
00:07:32,362 --> 00:07:46,112
But the more we talked about it, the more it became very clear that there was an opportunity here to ground this character in the world, and also to have it have callbacks to other encounters that you might run into.

82
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:51,215
So we worked together, and I came up with the name The Vigil of Stendar.

83
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:55,518
Stendar is the name of one of the gods in Skyrim, so that grounded it in the lore.

84
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,621
And I renamed the character and his backstory so that he was part of this faction.

85
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:07,266
When I originally wrote up the quest, I just wrote that it was going to be a haunted house, and that was going to be super fun.

86
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:09,688
But that was all I had.

87
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:18,152
When we actually sat down to work on what that meant together, Dio is the one who pitched the idea of, hey, we have a full physics system.

88
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:25,757
I could script all of the loose objects in the house and just fly them around randomly to simulate a poltergeist.

89
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:35,125
And then as we were working on it, I came up with the idea of why don't we have the entity speak to you like a ghost as you're progressing through the house.

90
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:39,489
Art also added in some storytelling bits.

91
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:52,080
When we were doing the lighting pass on the space, the effects artist who was working in it was a fan of the Poltergeist movie, and she suggested that we add a little Easter egg of the randomly stacked chairs inside the space.

92
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,174
World art also helped with some of the storytelling.

93
00:08:56,635 --> 00:09:04,160
I originally had the idea that you get trapped in the basement and that was just going to be a cage or some other very simple trap.

94
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:18,031
And the world artist assigned to make it came to me and said, I think we have an opportunity here to tie the story together by making an altar to the evil presence actually be the thing that springs the trap and it's tied into the altar.

95
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:21,854
And again, I originally was hesitant.

96
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,635
I felt like that would be a lot more work.

97
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:29,761
But he assured me, actually, it would be easier for him to make it all part of one experience.

98
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:36,026
So one of the big lessons I learned here was we're writing and designing the game together.

99
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:45,374
When I was getting a lot of suggestions from my colleagues about what we could do for this quest, I was originally very defensive.

100
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:59,320
You know, I thought that as, you know, I was a new quest designer, this was one of the first quests that I had worked on, and I thought if I didn't have control of everything and have everything perfect in my head, that I was a failure.

101
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:07,965
And so I didn't realize at the time that my colleagues were trying to give me the advantage of their expertise and perspective.

102
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:14,588
And once I let down that wall and started listening to them, that is what made the content so much richer.

103
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:21,055
So this is a very typical example of how we made all the content in Skyrim.

104
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:30,447
We had a piece that we all knew we needed to work on, we sort of came together, everyone added their bits to it, and then we would move on and do another piece.

105
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:35,113
But we were also experimenting with other ways to get work done.

106
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:48,039
So throughout Skyrim, we had several level designers starting to experiment with their own quests, making their own quests with the quest design tools, and just telling stories in that space a little more.

107
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,862
This leads to kind of an atypical example that I want to talk about here, where in the case of this example, I'm the level designer working on the location.

108
00:10:57,882 --> 00:11:01,343
There's a different level designer creating the quest that ends up layered through the location.

109
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:08,723
The quest is Lost to the Ages, created by Steve Cornett for Skyrim's Dawnguard DLC.

110
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:18,338
Lost to the Ages has you exploring the existing landmass of Skyrim, revisiting some old dungeons as well as some new ones, collecting some quest objects for the end of the quest.

111
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:26,622
I had been working on a location for Dawnguard as well, where all of its story was kind of tied within itself, and it was all visual storytelling mainly.

112
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:32,387
This is the location here, and you approach it, and you feel some earthquakes as you're approaching the exterior.

113
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:36,071
You continue to feel the earthquakes as you explore the interior of this location.

114
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:43,258
And once you get to the main chasm here, you see that the whole Dwarven Ruin has been split in half by a massive earthquake at some point in the past.

115
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:53,028
You explore the rest of the location, wind through these caverns fighting Falmer and other creatures until you reach the summit where there's a massive dwarven machine that you then turn off and the earthquakes will stop.

116
00:11:53,869 --> 00:12:00,917
At some point, Steve must have played through this location or knew about it in some way and came to me and said, hey, this is a really fun map to play through.

117
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:04,541
What do you think about if I were to add a quest NPC to your location?

118
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:10,887
that could kind of be a guide for the player through it, as well as, you know, explain some of the overarching Lost of the Ages quest narrative.

119
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:17,854
And I thought that sounded like an awesome idea, so Steve started to layer Katria, a ghost, throughout the location.

120
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:25,022
She starts out as a ghostly voice when you enter the tunnels, telling you to turn back, that it's dangerous here, once you hit the main chamber.

121
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:26,423
She reveals herself.

122
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:28,144
You see that it's a ghost you've been talking to.

123
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,087
And she motions down to her corpse and says, it's dangerous here.

124
00:12:32,187 --> 00:12:35,250
She repeats it and says, if you need help, I can help you through the location.

125
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,732
If you say no, she'll end up at the end near that dwarven machine.

126
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:44,537
But if you say yes, she'll kind of follow you through the location fighting Falmer and other creatures as you're making your way to the summit.

127
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:48,119
And this made me kind of realize that we actually do have some

128
00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:08,552
objects in like unique elements in this location that we could use some explaining to the player which would benefit us because This is a little dwarven mechanism that when you impact it in some way it spins to the top of its pole and then opens a door unlock something somewhere else and We have some visual storytelling here for it, but I was like hey Steve Do you think you could mention this to the player?

129
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,693
through Katria and kind of explain some of this.

130
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:15,835
And he said that that sounded good, so he explained some of these elements to the player.

131
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,717
They didn't have a name on them, so he named them kinetic resonators, which I thought worked out pretty well.

132
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:29,782
Steve and I collaborated back and forth on different elements like this throughout the location, but it all comes to a head at the end where you're in front of that big dwarven machine.

133
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:35,325
There's five of those kinetic resonators placed throughout it, and you need to hit it in a certain order to solve the puzzle.

134
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,182
and then the doors will open, the earthquakes will stop, and this part of the quest is completed as well.

135
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:49,207
If you get a bad pattern, you'll get hit by a trap of some kind, an enemy will spawn, there's plenty of visual storytelling around the location where we're explaining the bad things that can happen.

136
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:56,491
But the coolest thing that ended up happening here was Steve layered Katri's story into the location story by saying

137
00:13:57,485 --> 00:14:02,787
She's the one who put in the wrong pattern that caused the massive earthquake, and it's also why she's dead at the beginning of the location.

138
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,889
So that ties in really well with the story I already had for this location.

139
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:24,195
He also layered in a journal onto Katria's corpse that not only explains some Lost of the Ages quest thread you can pick up to find dungeons nearby to keep the quest going, but also final moments from Katria where she writes about this location in her journal and gives the player some hints to starting puzzle solutions at the end.

140
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:30,975
So like I had said, many level designers are learning the Quest tools and getting more familiar with them.

141
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:36,499
And this starts to develop kind of a shared language between Quest and level design.

142
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,723
And this language deepens our collaboration going forward onto future projects.

143
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,427
So now we're moving forward to Fallout 4.

144
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:54,873
And as I had said, many level designers, including myself, have messed with the Quest design tools more and more and are developing that shared language with the Quest design team.

145
00:14:57,257 --> 00:15:04,522
In this example, I'm going to talk about a larger scale, but back to a more typical example of quest and level collaboration.

146
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:12,547
So the quest is The Last Voyage of the USS Constitution, created by Ferret Bowdwin, who sadly passed away during the production of Starfield.

147
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:25,276
Ferret and I were teamed up to work on this location, and he came to me with a pitch of this World War I ship, the USS Constitution, moored on top of a bank here, rather than nearby in the water, where it actually is in real life.

148
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:39,548
near Boston, and he wanted the player to be able to explore the immediate area of the bank, be able to get inside the interior of the ship and meet the crew members, who are robots, and then get to the top deck and meet Captain Ironsides, who's a sentry bot.

149
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:46,792
And Captain Ironsides will ask for help repairing some elements of the ship, as well as the rocket engine, so he can get this ship back in the water where it belongs.

150
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:57,799
Farah also pitched some scavengers attacking at the start after you had finished meeting Ironsides, and then periodically throughout the quest as you're returning to repair different elements of the ship.

151
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,880
This is how the whole quest starts.

152
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,701
This is how it's established and everything.

153
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:13,947
What I want to talk about now is Farah and I's collaboration back and forth as we implemented the elements we kind of knew we wanted in here, as well as pushed on those elements to add to the gameplay and story in different ways.

154
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:19,719
First off, we had the different elements around the ship that you repair, including the engines.

155
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:28,365
I scripted up a system that would just use objects from around Fallout 4, because you pick up all kinds of random junk in Fallout to use the workshop system and craft things.

156
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,187
So I layered that into this system, and it worked pretty well.

157
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:41,994
Ferret played through it, and he's like, I like the repair setup, but what if we made it more personal to the player, where if they have a special stat on their character that could help them bypass

158
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:46,511
the need to go get the resource or expend the resources, they could just repair it outright.

159
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:49,154
And obviously, that sounds like a good idea.

160
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:53,521
So Ferret suggested a bunch of stat checks for the different stations, and I layered that into the scripting.

161
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,604
And I think that was a big benefit to the quest.

162
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,067
We didn't have a lot of those in other places in Fallout 4.

163
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:12,579
Also, after visiting, or talking to Ironsides for the first time and kind of getting your quest info, future visits to this location required you to trek all the way through the interior of the ship to get to the top to talk to the crew members again.

164
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,202
Ferret and I went back and forth on maybe how we could solve this.

165
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:21,104
One was to move the fast travel marker to the top of the ship, but that didn't seem as in world.

166
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:25,946
And if you wanted to role play arriving to the ship and leaving, you still had to deal with trekking all the way up to the top of the ship.

167
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:36,171
So I pitched this idea and then worked with WorldArt to implement this automated robo elevator that kind of rises you up to the top of the ship when you arrive and takes you back down to the street level when you're leaving.

168
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:41,796
Ferret had also played through the different scavenger attacks.

169
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,397
And we were really liking how those were shaping up.

170
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:49,240
But Ferret wondered if there's a way we could add a name or a face to this faction.

171
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,622
And if there's a place nearby, we could have them hole up and kind of have a little base for them.

172
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:58,585
And I told him there was a good spot where I'd been spawning scavengers already, kind of down in an alley.

173
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:05,909
So I worked with World Art to kind of turn some buildings into an old diner that the scavengers had made into a makeshift base.

174
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:13,155
And then Ferret went in and layered in some named NPCs, some dialogue for them, so you can kind of get an idea of why they're doing what they're doing, why they're attacking the ship.

175
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:18,696
And Ferret kept working on this little chunk of this area with the scavengers.

176
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:24,018
And this ends up turning into a possible quest path, where you can actually sabotage Ironsides and the ship.

177
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:29,099
And that'll ultimately result in you getting double-crossed by the scavengers, if you take that path.

178
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:35,720
And also, World Art was adding a lot more elements to the World War I ship, the USS Constitution.

179
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:36,898
uh...

180
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:42,373
kind of almost last of which is these cannons that were pretty much facing right where the scavengers are attacking.

181
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:47,554
Everybody who played through this sequence wanted to fire the cannons in some way.

182
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,835
So Ferret and I started talking about maybe ways we could solve this.

183
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:56,316
And that's when he reminded me that the end reward of this quest is actually a weapon called the broadsider.

184
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:59,237
And it's a small cannon you can hold that shoots small cannonballs.

185
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:06,759
With that reminder that that was in the game, I was able to easily set up these cannons to fire down the whole line of them when you pull the

186
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,561
the circuit breaker here, and then after a short cooldown, you can use it again.

187
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:18,346
And then Ferret went in and added in an optional objective to the attacks that would remind the player that these cannons are available for use after their cooldown.

188
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:35,557
So you have helped Ironsides repair the ship, you've dealt with the scavengers, he sends you over to flip one last circuit breaker from a good vantage point, and you pull the circuit breaker, it powers up the engines, and then the players get this reward at the end.

189
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:38,328
And this is just a gif, there's no audio.

190
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:46,336
But the rear engines kick in by themselves at first and kind of drags the ship off of the bank.

191
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:50,220
And just before it falls into the water, the front engines kick in and keep it afloat.

192
00:19:53,924 --> 00:20:00,030
And if you were wondering, you can actually jump across the buildings to my left and actually hitch a ride on this thing and just ride it over to where it ends up.

193
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,377
You won't survive it though.

194
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:03,501
We had to put a kill trigger in.

195
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:07,254
The loader couldn't keep up with how fast the player was moving, so we kind of had to end it.

196
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:13,017
So Ferret and I's collaboration didn't end there.

197
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:18,118
We now have a World War I ship in the Boston skyline at the top of one of the skyscrapers.

198
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,339
You can see it now from everywhere on the map.

199
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,060
We were trying to figure out how to get the player up there in the least amount of changes to the game.

200
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,742
And I ended up pitching this idea and kind of going with an elevator that takes you from the bottom floor to the top.

201
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:36,757
And it's some empty rooms up there, and you can explore a little bit of them and loot some stuff.

202
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:41,079
After the state change of the crash, that same elevator just drops you out onto the wreck.

203
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:54,946
And then Ferret went in, added some post-quest dialogue to the crew robots, as well as Captain Ironsides, where Captain Ironsides doubles down on the fact that this mission has been a success, and by his calculations, in a mere century, will take to the seas.

204
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:06,290
So it really benefits you to kind of learn or develop a shared language with the people you're collaborating with, especially if they're in other departments.

205
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:15,558
It'll really benefit kind of the efficiency you hook up your content and kind of the options you have once you start pushing on it and putting it in different directions.

206
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:22,576
So after Fallout 4, Daryl and I get tapped to lead a DLC.

207
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:28,860
And so now we are not only making content, but we have to plan and review content as well.

208
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,082
So this ended up being Fallout 4 Far Harbor.

209
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:39,746
And during the planning phase of Far Harbor, we had a very concise, clear set of goals.

210
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:43,568
One of the big ones was we knew we wanted multiple endings.

211
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,610
The base game of Fallout 4 had been out for a while.

212
00:21:47,230 --> 00:22:00,775
When we were planning this DLC and one of the big major points of feedback we got from both the press and our audience was they wanted more choices and consequences, a lot of that crunchy RPG story stuff.

213
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:03,216
So we knew we wanted multiple endings.

214
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:08,858
We also knew we wanted to add more non-combat gameplay and solutions to quest content.

215
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:16,904
We also knew that people were probably going to play this DLC after they had finished the base game, so we had to have high-level equipment added.

216
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:26,252
And then we also wanted to continue the success we had in Skyrim Fallout 4 by allowing the development team to experiment more during the DLC.

217
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:40,127
One of those experimentations was we had three factions, and we gave ownership to the story for each faction to an individual quest designer each, so a different quest designer owned each faction.

218
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:46,415
And one of the major things we did was give them more say over both the story, but also all the outcomes.

219
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:54,120
When we were planning the DLC originally, I only planned for about three outcomes for the ending.

220
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:04,447
And by the time the quest designers finished up Far Harbor, they had added about a dozen to 15 endings, depending on which variations you count.

221
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:11,472
Some of them were pretty small, but they were able to take choice consequences and reactivity a lot further than I thought was possible.

222
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:19,444
We also added in more of those stat challenges that we had originally put in for the USS Constitution Quest.

223
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:21,506
So we added those everywhere.

224
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,750
We also added in an entire new puzzle gameplay system.

225
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:32,916
This was inspired by 90s, early 2000s virtual reality movies and sequences.

226
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:34,677
So a lot of bright colors.

227
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:40,963
And the basic idea here was we needed to tap into and retrieve memories from an Android.

228
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:49,775
but we were able to complete an entire tower defense system within Fallout 4 in a matter of months by the end of the DLC.

229
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:55,831
Another thing that happened was we had artists who wanted to experiment with design.

230
00:23:56,271 --> 00:24:02,254
So one of our world artists, Nadia Hashert, wanted to write the story for the space she was working on.

231
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,455
She pitched the story to me and Daryl.

232
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:05,776
We approved it.

233
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:07,157
Great little tale.

234
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:12,359
She wrote all the notes, but also used her art background to do illustrations to help sell the story.

235
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:19,188
And another big thing we did is we wanted to continue to allow level designers to experiment with quest design.

236
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:31,612
And so Dee Langlois, who I had worked with on Skyrim, was tapped to do both a large quest, a big side quest, but also a really large location that would encapsulate the quest.

237
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:39,995
And this ended up being the Braindead side quest in Far Harbor, which takes place in a vault and is a murder mystery involving robots.

238
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:47,523
So those were our plans, but we experienced a lot of setbacks as we moved to actually make the entire DLC.

239
00:24:50,225 --> 00:25:01,813
So now I'm going to talk about how we went about solving some project-wide problems that came up during Far Harbor, as well as kind of things we didn't solve and what we realized after we had finished Far Harbor, the mistakes we had made in some cases.

240
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:12,655
So first off, the three different faction questlines that Will had talked about ended up requiring more elaborate battle sequences than we had originally anticipated.

241
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,440
We ended up calling in an experienced level designer, Steve Cornett, to come in and help out.

242
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:26,563
And Steve had not only set up kind of scripted sequences like this before, but as I had mentioned in the atypical example before, he's worked with the quest tools.

243
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:29,204
He's developed a shared language with the quest designers.

244
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:38,827
So he's able to implement the attack, as well as explain the needed elements to hook into the quests for the various quest designers that were running the faction quests.

245
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:43,048
They could communicate quickly and get this stuff done and kind of across the finish line in time.

246
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:56,945
Also, the puzzles that represented the memory sequences in the game, I worked on myself along with one of our senior systems designer, Kurt Coleman, who worked on a lot of the workshop elements in Fallout 4.

247
00:25:57,386 --> 00:26:05,611
He and I worked on all of the puzzle elements for these puzzle sequences, and then I went in and made all five of the puzzle levels for the game.

248
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:13,874
And the issues we ended up having with these were that puzzles could confuse the players at times, but ultimately overstay their welcome for most players.

249
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:21,358
And the biggest issue was that we had made five puzzles, and the first three are mandatory, and the last two are optional.

250
00:26:21,758 --> 00:26:27,460
And I took full advantage of the optional puzzles by using all of the gameplay elements to make it kind of as fun and challenging as I could.

251
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:30,842
I had been playing a lot of Portal 2 at the time and making a lot of portal maps.

252
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,583
That's also probably why a lot of this is in here.

253
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:40,132
But the issue with the player is they would end up going into the first memory sequence.

254
00:26:40,492 --> 00:26:47,633
And after the third memory sequence, we'd pop an objective for them to come out to the main land, out of the virtual reality area.

255
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:50,694
But we'd continue to pop objectives for the remaining memory sequences.

256
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:55,375
And most players assumed they had to complete all five of them before they even left the memory sequence.

257
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:58,096
And I believe most players played all of them.

258
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:11,581
Also, our large location and large quest that was taken on by a solo level designer, Dee Langlois, ended up being too much for one person to take on the way we had scoped it.

259
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:22,963
We had kind of done what we had done on previous projects when a level designer took on a location and a quest, or just a lot from another silo, like quest design, and just buffered some more time.

260
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:25,283
And this time, we did it again and just buffered more time.

261
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:30,424
And we realized we actually needed to properly scope these, get buy-in from both quest and level production

262
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:33,165
to actually get these completed properly.

263
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:43,729
This ended up requiring us to have D focus on the quest elements to get those finished up, while we brought in outside level designer help to finish up the location elements.

264
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:52,084
The end results of Far Harbor, after we had shipped, were that Will and I got to work together and lead a project, which was really awesome.

265
00:27:52,844 --> 00:28:01,247
The criticism on Far Harbor was mostly positive, which was really satisfying to hear and kind of read on the internet in places and hear from people, really.

266
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:10,010
Our biggest sore spot were the puzzles and us not properly telegraphing the player, which ones were kind of mandatory, which were optional.

267
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:17,172
And our level design quests that we took on for this project needed more production buy-in from both sides to be properly scoped.

268
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:22,198
But in the end, our team morale was really high, and we were excited about whatever our next project was going to be.

269
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:31,269
The next thing I want to talk about is what happens to our collaboration and the way we work when the work starts to get really difficult.

270
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,892
So we're moving forward in time here to Fallout 76 now.

271
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:48,722
And the two things to keep in mind are we're scaling up internally, as well as working with external studios more than we had ever done before, as well as taking on a multiplayer project, which we also had never done before.

272
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:52,965
And the first thing I want to cover is the easy stuff.

273
00:28:53,005 --> 00:29:03,434
And what I mean by that is the stuff that was at least as fast to iterate on or as fast to kind of get the content in to the game as it was in previous projects, compared to previous projects.

274
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:13,954
So during Fallout 76, we were able to do basic level design almost as fast as we had done it during previous Bethesda projects.

275
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:17,135
We were able to build out our worlds up to the level you kind of can see here.

276
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,295
We could add in encounters.

277
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:23,716
We could do all kinds of the things we needed to do on previous projects to kind of flesh our locations out.

278
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:28,217
But the biggest hurdle comes in when we need to deal with a multiplayer element.

279
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:37,259
If we want to play our level with another player or play through our location with a quest enabled, that would require the server to be spun up to support all of this.

280
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:47,662
And our iteration time, typically, at Bethesda during non-multiplayer projects, is about a minute to kind of see your changes in game, which is pretty fast.

281
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:48,722
And we came to rely on that.

282
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:51,883
We could also push changes to the game that was already running.

283
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:54,924
So we could do some changes almost instantaneously.

284
00:29:55,664 --> 00:30:01,068
Once we had to deal with a server, we ended up dealing with kind of iteration times.

285
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:06,892
It could go anywhere from 3 minutes up to 10 minutes on a bad day if the server's having issues that day.

286
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:14,677
But basic level design, we could still build out the world and stuff without having to rely too much on the server spinning up, which really benefited us in the long run.

287
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,321
as far as building out the world.

288
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:19,442
There was other caveats to that that I'll bring up later.

289
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:22,504
We also got to start with Fallout 4 assets from the beginning.

290
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:30,289
This was a luxury we'd never been able to use before, other than going from a project into DLC, where you can just hit the ground running and work right away.

291
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:33,051
So we were able to do that on Fallout 76.

292
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:35,372
And that really helped us.

293
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:41,156
The combination of hit the ground running at the beginning, as well as have the iteration time to build out the world was really beneficial to us.

294
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:46,234
World art was also able to iterate just about as fast as we were for the same reasons.

295
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:51,056
We were able to get the world blocked out, the landscape, or kind of define where our locations were going to go.

296
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:53,937
And we had all the assets to kind of block all this stuff out right away.

297
00:30:54,758 --> 00:31:02,600
This was really beneficial to us because the map, as we had scoped it for 76, was to be about four times the size of Fallout 4.

298
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,662
So all these benefits to world building were really helpful to us.

299
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:19,878
The next thing I want to talk about is the hard stuff, and that's the opposite of the easy stuff, which is the stuff that just took longer on this project for various reasons that I'll start to explain as we go through the different examples.

300
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:29,681
First off, the multiplayer hurdles that came up, especially for level design when it came to scripting our locations.

301
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:35,403
Even if you were knowledgeable with our proprietary scripting language from previous projects,

302
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:55,498
adding in the hurdles of multiplayer could really cause issues with even somebody who's used to scripting, knowing which events and which functions fire on the server versus the client was enough to kind of make some level designers not want to script anymore because of the added confusion and the iteration time just to test if they did anything proper anyway.

303
00:31:56,478 --> 00:32:04,941
Early on in Fallout 76, I decided to add some scripting elements to the location that were elements that I had done before.

304
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:07,982
That way, the only hurdles I'd run into were the multiplayer ones.

305
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:13,864
And I was also trying to figure out what an interesting multiplayer Fallout location would be, because that was a new thing for us.

306
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:17,405
And I settled on this set of haunted cabins.

307
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:18,786
This is Alpine River Cabins.

308
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:23,167
And you can come here alone, obviously, or with a group of friends, or just with random players.

309
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,448
And you'll discover that there's

310
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,889
There's haunted picture frames that spin randomly.

311
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,310
There's doors that will slam closed every once in a while.

312
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,530
Distant screaming.

313
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,511
I'd spawn enemies randomly.

314
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:38,853
And keen-eyed players could spot power cables that would bounce between the

315
00:32:39,484 --> 00:32:42,024
the cabins as well as head up into the trees.

316
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:47,786
And if you follow them up into the trees, you'll find a treehouse overlooking the cabins.

317
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:50,926
And all of the haunted sequences are set to be automated.

318
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:54,167
So it's just firing through all of them, and players are experiencing them.

319
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,868
You can actually turn off the terminal sequence and then affect them yourselves.

320
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,768
So you can mess with your friends or other random players that are passing by.

321
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:04,929
What this ended up kind of proving out is that

322
00:33:06,229 --> 00:33:20,297
the difficulty and the hurdles that multiplayer added to not only our scripting and understanding that, but also our iteration time, and ended up limiting the number of unique gameplay experiences we could add to our individual locations.

323
00:33:20,337 --> 00:33:27,260
And that was really something we did a lot in previous projects, was just add a little more scripting to bring up the story some or make our location more memorable.

324
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:31,903
This also ended up having a ripple effect of

325
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:41,394
level design kind of unlearning that shared language they had developed with the Quest team because of using the Quest tools and doing scripting.

326
00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:45,977
Since we were doing less of that, all of the stuff that was benefited from it started to dissipate.

327
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:54,082
Also something to keep in mind that I mentioned at the beginning of the 76 section is our scale.

328
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:57,203
We're starting to scale up more than we ever had before.

329
00:33:57,623 --> 00:34:04,346
And to set the pace here is we shipped Skyrim with a little over 100 developers.

330
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:09,469
And the process we used to make this game is the one that Will and I have been describing through this talk.

331
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:15,970
already, but as you look here, moving forward into Fallout 4, we didn't scale up that much more.

332
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:24,819
We did bring in some outside help from Behavior Interactive on things like our rendering tech and some other graphics things, but our scale didn't change that much.

333
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:32,266
We still ran with the same process when we developed Fallout 4, but as we move forward into 76, you can see that our scale just kind of

334
00:34:33,227 --> 00:34:36,432
goes to a level where we were not obviously expecting it.

335
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:41,779
At this point, we are double what we were on Fallout 4, even if you include our external help.

336
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,907
We also are adding more external help from other studios that are kind of owned by the umbrella company that owns us.

337
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:55,249
And also keep in mind, the blue that defines BGS devs under Fallout 76 is not actually solid.

338
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:57,870
It's made up of four Bethesda studios.

339
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,330
So even internally, we're trying to communicate remotely and figure out how that works.

340
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:08,731
And now at this level of scale, it's impossible for any one person to know everybody on the team.

341
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:14,992
And it's also much more difficult than ever to know who does what, who you're supposed to report to.

342
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,913
So that just affects process all across the board.

343
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,309
In the end, Fallout 76 has a rough launch.

344
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:34,402
We end up taking another year, adding in human NPCs, dialogue for those human NPCs, instance interior locations, so you can actually have quest content that can change state of the world.

345
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:40,889
We end up adding all that content to the Wastelanders DLC, which ends up helping revive Fallout 76.

346
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:51,752
So moving forward, we know we have to deal with this new issue of scale and how do we work with this incredibly large team.

347
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,774
So let's talk about Starfield.

348
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:05,953
So by the time we ship Starfield, we have grown even more, probably by about the same amount from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, as you can see here, well over 500 people.

349
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:11,795
But also, we are now working with a large number of external groups, well over a dozen.

350
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:21,898
And these groups are doing everything from effects, lighting, they're working on tools programming, systems programming, pretty much everything.

351
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:25,959
and they have to all be integrated into the development team for the work they are doing.

352
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:38,683
And another part of this is these are external groups, each with their own culture, each with their own leadership, and they are being brought in at various times throughout production, sometimes early on, sometimes to finish it.

353
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:45,771
So life becomes a lot more focused on our task tracking software.

354
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,231
We were using Jira at the time.

355
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:54,755
Jira definitely became a way of life as we tried to reconcile and handle all of the work being done across so many people.

356
00:36:55,455 --> 00:37:00,177
And the process we ended up settling on was one that was departmental

357
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:01,337
focused.

358
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:08,659
So we had all of the approvals handled by a departmental lead who also had a departmental producer.

359
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,700
So for example, Quest Design, there was a lead Quest Designer.

360
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,480
I was the lead Quest Designer for Starfield.

361
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:17,001
I had a design producer specific to Quest.

362
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:26,784
And we would go through all of the requests and proposals, approve them, and then send that up to a member of senior leadership who would also approve them.

363
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:32,765
Another thing we had to do was also start reconciling the schedule across all areas of production.

364
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:39,887
So every request now needed to go through all the producers because we needed to check all of the contingent work.

365
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:43,568
Asking for something as simple as a chair wasn't so simple.

366
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,808
Do you need animations for it?

367
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:47,649
Do you need sound effects for it?

368
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,429
How much does that add to the schedule?

369
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:53,330
Can it not fit because one of those teams does not have the time?

370
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,311
That all had to be wrangled.

371
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,211
And so that became a way of life for many people.

372
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:57,351
tool.

373
00:37:57,852 --> 00:38:03,438
And then finally, because there's so much work going on, we needed to make sure that there was accountability for all of that work.

374
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:15,892
And so we needed to create a system where all of the departmental leads were the ones providing the feedback for all the work done, and also verifying that the work was completed, and saying, yes, it's finished now.

375
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:24,757
So this had an inadvertent consequence of favoring the department over the actual project and what the project needed.

376
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:31,181
And this makes a lot of sense because when you are first asked to be a department lead, you're worried about the department.

377
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:33,623
That is the thing you're told you're responsible for.

378
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:41,288
Suddenly you have to reconcile several people's schedules, you're responsible for them, you're responsible for their time.

379
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:41,728
and

380
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,220
to collaboration requests.

381
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:24,642
So another consequence of this was, as we moved forward, was documentation became a way of life and became absolutely critical.

382
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:36,706
We used to be able to just sit down someone new to the team with someone who had already been on the project, and they would just learn all of the things they needed to know, kind of almost through osmosis.

383
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:40,587
But now we had to rely on all of our documentation tools.

384
00:39:40,987 --> 00:39:44,448
So for example, we had a shared documentation tool with Confluence.

385
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:46,129
We were also using Slack.

386
00:39:46,449 --> 00:40:03,955
We had to make sure and enforce putting communication in the major Slack groups, not only so that it could be asynchronous, but also so that everyone could see it, because we needed to make sure there were no hallway conversations that was hiding work that was being requested.

387
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:07,136
And finally, we had to do a lot more tutorials.

388
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:10,557
So I was in OBS Studio a lot making video tutorials.

389
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:17,739
So on Fallout 4, when I needed to teach someone the tool set, I would just sit down with them and answer their questions.

390
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,240
But now we were working with people from around the nation, sometimes around the globe.

391
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,902
I often didn't know when they would need me, and I often didn't know who might need me or what they would need to know.

392
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:37,403
So it became absolutely critical to do a lot more tutorials and how-tos about every feature of the toolkit.

393
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:43,897
Another interesting consequence, by the way, this is not a real Slack profile.

394
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:47,461
I grabbed this from Slack's website, so no secrets here.

395
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:59,055
But this is an example of a phenomenon that happened where not everyone knows you or has a relationship with you, especially if they're from one of those outside groups who's coming in to help at the end.

396
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:01,638
So your title became incredibly important.

397
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:17,139
There are many people I met because they messaged me because they saw my title and they were assigned to work on something maybe that day and didn't know who to speak to, so they came to me assuming, oh, well, you must know something about this because you have lead.

398
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:17,960
in the future.

399
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:39,647
So, what does level and quest design collaboration look like in this environment?

400
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,431
You know, game developers hate bureaucracy.

401
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:44,233
We now have a ton of bureaucracy.

402
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:50,421
So, can you continue to make memorable moments at this sort of scale with this sort of overhead?

403
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:54,424
So I'm going to have one last example of content.

404
00:41:55,204 --> 00:41:58,646
This is the buried temple sequence at the end of Starfield.

405
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:03,749
So I was implementing the main quest in addition to leading the quest design team.

406
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:09,453
And this was around the time I had done the third iteration of the main quest.

407
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:12,134
So I had written and implemented the main quest about three times.

408
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:16,317
And we were finally at a state in the project where we could play through the whole thing together.

409
00:42:16,897 --> 00:42:25,726
And it became very clear that we were missing a large final location that was going to tie the main story together and have a satisfying action-filled payoff.

410
00:42:26,347 --> 00:42:35,956
We also didn't have a big space battle at the end, and this was a space game, we added a new space battle system, so we had to have some more elaborate sequence added there as well.

411
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:38,785
I had a problem.

412
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:44,567
I was both implementing the main quest and leading the quest design team, so I had absolutely no time.

413
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:47,868
The entire quest design team was already overbooked.

414
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:53,669
And so we went to a trusted senior level designer, Steve Cornett.

415
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,350
We've talked about Steve a number of times in this talk.

416
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,711
He was definitely our panic button multiple times.

417
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,892
He might still be the panic button now, we're not sure.

418
00:43:03,452 --> 00:43:06,833
But we knew that Steve had worked on a lot of quest design

419
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:08,455
since Skyrim.

420
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:12,098
And so we went to Steve and said, hey, quest design is overbooked.

421
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:17,364
We need someone who can pitch and implement the final quest of Starfield.

422
00:43:18,185 --> 00:43:25,133
And I was on hand to help write dialogue and review the content with him so that we could get a tight iteration loop because we didn't have a lot of time.

423
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:29,634
And we also made sure we assigned him a separate level designer.

424
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:34,355
A level designer from BGS Montreal, Samuel Frontot, handled the layout.

425
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:44,377
Because as we learned previously, asking someone to do both an incredibly large space and an incredibly large quest in a small amount of time was not possible.

426
00:43:44,798 --> 00:43:46,778
So we knew we needed help from the beginning.

427
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:51,579
So Steve pitched this idea of having a dimension hopping mechanic.

428
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:55,140
Starfield is ultimately a story about parallel universes.

429
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:04,328
And he thought we could take spaces from the main story and have you hop into them throughout the final sequence to tie everything together.

430
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:12,835
We also added in a final fight with an adversary, including a way to skip the fight entirely using the speech challenge system.

431
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:21,662
And Steve repeated the dimension hopping mechanic here so that you would be fighting your adversary throughout several iconic spaces from the main quest.

432
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:35,511
So this was really made possible by a collaboration, a very classic collaboration between old veteran designers from Skyrim and new designers who had come in more recently.

433
00:44:36,411 --> 00:44:41,074
And the thing that made this work was necessity and urgency.

434
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:45,037
So as teams get large, they will silo naturally.

435
00:44:45,097 --> 00:44:45,977
That happens.

436
00:44:46,598 --> 00:44:46,798
But

437
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:55,480
Necessity and urgency also naturally breaks silos because we knew we had to have this piece in for the main quest.

438
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,900
Main quest is an important piece of content.

439
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,021
It gets priority.

440
00:44:59,421 --> 00:45:01,421
But we also knew we didn't have a lot of time.

441
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:05,422
So trying to do everything formally wasn't going to work.

442
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:09,363
We had a lot of experience with how long that bureaucracy would take.

443
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:12,245
And so we know we needed to suspend things.

444
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:17,909
So we moved mountains and shifted things around so that a small group of people could work on this very, very quickly.

445
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:22,732
Now, you don't need to wait for an emergency in order to do this.

446
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:37,083
The important thing is providing your team with a set of project-centered goals and project-centered communication, always letting people know constantly and consistently, hey, this is what the current problem with the project is.

447
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:49,872
All of the departmental leads need to know that when it comes to their individual work and their individual teams, we need to all collectively sacrifice for these higher level goals so that we can hit the things that we need to hit.

448
00:45:50,992 --> 00:45:54,175
So let's talk about some takeaways.

449
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:58,956
Number one, write and design your game together.

450
00:45:59,396 --> 00:46:06,979
You might have an area of responsibility, but your colleagues in your other specialties have a lot to add to your work.

451
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:15,401
They have other perspectives, and you do not need to be defensive or ultimately even in control of your own content.

452
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:16,902
We're all along for the ride.

453
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:18,162
They will make the work better.

454
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:27,455
Also, remember to develop a shared language with the people you're collaborating with, especially if they're in another department.

455
00:46:28,276 --> 00:46:40,462
It'll help you more efficiently put your content into the game, but it ends up expanding your storytelling abilities and allows you to push the content you do end up with in the game into fun in different directions.

456
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:46,868
Give your team clear goals and let them reach for it.

457
00:46:47,249 --> 00:46:53,696
Creatives really thrive in a sandbox where things are defined but there's a lot of room to play and experiment.

458
00:46:54,297 --> 00:46:58,582
This will allow them to achieve things and surprise you in ways you didn't think were possible.

459
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:05,188
And also remember that when the work gets difficult, people will tend to do what is most comfortable to them.

460
00:47:05,228 --> 00:47:08,150
And oftentimes, that's retreating back into their specialties.

461
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:12,713
This will end up having a negative effect on any shared language that has been developed.

462
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:16,755
And it will also end up focusing the content of your game on the stuff that's easier to do.

463
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:23,880
So make sure that if you want certain content in your game, make sure it's not super difficult to implement or you won't get as much as you want of it.

464
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:35,180
And finally, large teams will naturally silo, and emergencies will naturally break them out of it, but you do not need to wait for an emergency.

465
00:47:35,641 --> 00:47:49,072
Clear, consistent project-level goals and communication will keep everyone focused on what they need to focus on, and everyone will do what's necessary to make sure that the project succeeds over their department or their individual teams.

466
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:58,365
So we want to take a moment here to thank all of the collaborators we've named in this talk, and also all of the collaborators we didn't name.

467
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:00,807
It takes a lot of people to make these games.

468
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:06,891
So thank you for everyone who has worked on us on various titles over the years.

469
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:10,473
And we want to give a special mention to Ferret Bodoin.

470
00:48:10,913 --> 00:48:16,417
As Daryl said, we lost Ferret during the production of Starfield.

471
00:48:17,157 --> 00:48:19,159
We had known him for over a decade.

472
00:48:20,415 --> 00:48:25,858
He was a very fiercely optimistic person, probably the most optimistic person we had ever worked with.

473
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:30,201
He brought a lot of joy, both to the content he made and to the team.

474
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:31,922
So thank you so much, Ferret.

475
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,006
Thank you all for coming.

476
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:44,847
Please line up for questions.

477
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,389
Remember to fill out your evaluations.

478
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:50,732
This is our social media handles if you want to talk to us later.

479
00:48:51,452 --> 00:48:52,173
Thank you so much.

480
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:54,030
Hi.

481
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:12,701
like

482
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:31,066
I don't

483
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:50,007
like

484
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:16,835
What they can and can't do in an alias is just a pointer to something in the game world that the quest can hold on to and refer to even if it's not loaded.

485
00:50:17,156 --> 00:50:30,429
But it's all little goofy things like that, which can either come from your studio having proper documentation so the language stays alive, or the way it happened at Bethesda was you'd sit down and learn how to use the tool or learn from someone else.

486
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:32,812
and then the shared language you just kind of develop.

487
00:50:33,213 --> 00:50:37,981
It's not specifically terms, it's just an understanding of maybe what you're asking of them.

488
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:42,307
When you ask them a question you kind of know how much work you're asking from them.

489
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:44,731
That's kind of what I take out of shared language.

490
00:50:45,072 --> 00:50:45,713
Yeah, definitely.

491
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:47,736
Hi.

492
00:50:48,737 --> 00:50:53,140
First, I just wanted to thank you both for these games and your work.

493
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:06,489
Genuinely, these games and quests and levels raised me and taught me, made me who I am in terms of quest design and game development and just as a person in general, and I really appreciate that.

494
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:14,471
And coming from that, I'm very curious, because you've worked at this studio for a long time, and you've left now.

495
00:51:14,591 --> 00:51:28,353
And I'm just curious, with this large amount of scale and this huge growth in the team that seems to have created a lot of stress and a lot of difficulty to manage, do you think that a large team inherently creates this?

496
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,874
Or is it the scope of the game from the beginning?

497
00:51:30,894 --> 00:51:34,935
I'm just curious of what could have been avoided or what could be improved.

498
00:51:36,842 --> 00:51:42,827
OK, yeah, so do large teams inevitably create bureaucracy and stress?

499
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:45,929
And could this be a salt of scaling?

500
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:51,173
So scale and team size are kind of the same thing, especially nowadays.

501
00:51:51,593 --> 00:51:54,335
So the bigger your game, the more people you need.

502
00:51:54,956 --> 00:52:02,181
I don't know if scale is necessarily the enemy of agility, but I do think that when

503
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:06,324
Teams get larger, there are certain natural things that happen.

504
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:18,709
One of them I mentioned is siloing, but another one is, so there's a neurological theory called Dunbar's number, that's how many social connections that you can support in your brain, and it's theorized to be about 150.

505
00:52:18,749 --> 00:52:27,113
So once you pass 150, it's impossible to hold everyone in your head and have a connection with everyone on the team.

506
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:31,335
So, you need to start kind of splitting things off.

507
00:52:31,575 --> 00:52:46,961
And I think if you're very aggressive about chunking up the team so that it doesn't get above that size, you can have individual sub-teams within a larger project that can then have a collaborative sort of natural relationship.

508
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:54,431
Or another thing you could do is just be very aggressive about titles, formalization, and communication structure.

509
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:59,758
It's the boring part of game development, but it's like flossing or eating your vegetables.

510
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:02,242
Especially when you have a lot of people, that's what you have to do.

511
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:03,584
Makes a lot of sense.

512
00:53:03,624 --> 00:53:04,245
Thank you very much.

513
00:53:06,678 --> 00:53:12,123
Hello, just to echo what the last question asker just said, thank you for these games, they're awesome.

514
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:18,249
Great talk, that was a lot of fun and a great trajectory through your entire history of games.

515
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:21,151
My question is simple.

516
00:53:21,271 --> 00:53:26,196
A big part of the talk is basically cross department collaboration, allowing people to do something that isn't their regular job.

517
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:26,716
talk.

518
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:44,153
I

519
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:06,465
It can be hard.

520
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:07,506
You can't incorporate it all.

521
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:11,148
And they either have to know that or never learn it.

522
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:11,648
I don't know.

523
00:54:12,108 --> 00:54:12,669
Yeah, yeah.

524
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:16,410
That's why it's so important to say who is ultimately responsible.

525
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:24,054
You need to be able to say, OK, at the end of the day, you're going to have subjective calls that you have to make.

526
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,696
And you need to know who's going to make that call.

527
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:34,780
So for level, the level designer needs to make the final call when it comes to anything that affects the layout and the encounters in the space.

528
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,681
Awesome, thank you.

529
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,112
Thank you guys for the talk.

530
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:55,013
My question kind of prongs two ways but might end up being the same answer.

531
00:54:55,553 --> 00:55:11,217
I was surprised from your examples at how disjointed it seemed that quest and level design were in terms of like the level designers were working on the level independent of what it was actually going to be in the quest and it seemed to come together later on in development.

532
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:14,618
So my first question is typically when

533
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:26,929
when did your guys' teams collaborate in the design process and other than I imagine it should be at the beginning of the design, when should these teams collaborate?

534
00:55:27,382 --> 00:55:29,645
Yeah, when should the teams collaborate?

535
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:34,950
You feel like it felt like we were working independently and then came together.

536
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:40,056
And that was, in our experience, there were different levels of that.

537
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:44,200
So sometimes it was, hey, I came up with a quest.

538
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:45,582
I need a space for it.

539
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:46,703
Your space looks cool.

540
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:48,205
I'm going to take it.

541
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:49,226
and

542
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:05,640
on Skyrim.

543
00:56:27,913 --> 00:56:29,893
Hey, thanks for the really great games over the years.

544
00:56:31,954 --> 00:56:41,816
You said something earlier that kind of prompted a question in my mind, and you mentioned that the quest designers were typically responsible for the combat NPCs, or sorry, the other way around.

545
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:47,017
The level designers were typically responsible for the combat NPCs, and the quest designers were responsible for non-combat.

546
00:56:47,377 --> 00:56:53,318
But I'm curious how that worked in games like Skyrim or Fallout 4, where those lines got very fuzzy a lot of the time, because the player could

547
00:56:53,858 --> 00:56:59,001
fight anyone at any time, and especially farther back in Bethesda's history you go, the more of that there is.

548
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:12,590
And yeah, I'm just curious how you decided who kind of got to make calls on things like that, where you had NPCs that could, at any minute in these systems, kind of shift between those two dimensions.

549
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:19,995
Yeah, so how do you deal with having particular responsibilities when it's an open world and chaos can erupt at any time?

550
00:57:20,589 --> 00:57:25,603
I think it ends up depending on what the purpose of the NPC actually is.

551
00:57:25,663 --> 00:57:28,411
In a town, you can fight with anything and combat will erupt.

552
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,741
but an LD is still probably not likely in charge of anything in the town.

553
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:40,129
So, like, it's more about if the location and the NPCs that are there were set up to be a combat encounter already.

554
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:45,374
There can be cases where, like, there can be important quest dialogue on a boss you're going to kill.

555
00:57:45,814 --> 00:57:50,859
We have to converse about that, decide, like, OK, before he dies, he's got to get this dialogue out.

556
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:53,541
Like, there's some back and forth when it comes to, like,

557
00:57:54,682 --> 00:58:07,749
like little detailed stuff, but typically I think it's a shared language thing where we just understand this is a combat NPC, this is a quest NPC and that's the line, but there's probably like rules there that we're not explaining about how we define those.

558
00:58:11,002 --> 00:58:14,765
Hi, yes, thank both of you for your beautiful games and a really insightful presentation.

559
00:58:15,466 --> 00:58:30,277
I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to the philosophy behind having quest designers handle the more kind of traditional narrative elements as well as like scripting and other quest design elements that are seen more across lots of different studios.

560
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:35,822
I'm just curious, what are your thoughts on that philosophy and do you see that as kind of the future as well of Bethesda Game Studios?

561
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:37,006
Oh, interesting.

562
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:43,050
Yeah, so why does Bethesda Game Studios have the Quest department handle both narrative and quest scripting?

563
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:45,352
A lot of that was just tradition.

564
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:54,279
You know, a lot of these processes started way back in like Morrowind, and so that was a much smaller team then and you just wore a lot of hats.

565
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,182
Like, Quest Design also did systems design for a long time.

566
00:58:57,862 --> 00:59:04,708
And the level design department, I believe that was really formalized End of Oblivion Skyrim-ish?

567
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:05,749
Or Fallout 3-ish?

568
00:59:09,899 --> 00:59:16,861
Yeah, and so the specialization occurred over time, and there was a level design department, and eventually there was a systems design department.

569
00:59:17,461 --> 00:59:22,262
So I think the thing is, there's no standardization in the games industry.

570
00:59:22,302 --> 00:59:29,705
We all do it the way we need to, and the teams vary so much in size that depending on where you're at, you could wear different hats.

571
00:59:29,785 --> 00:59:31,685
So I think it just evolved very naturally.

572
00:59:32,805 --> 00:59:33,105
Thank you.

573
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:33,165
Oh.

574
00:59:35,462 --> 00:59:37,224
All right, it's time for us to wrap up.

575
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:40,428
We will go to the wrap up session.

576
00:59:40,688 --> 00:59:43,151
Please follow folks if you want to head there.

577
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:44,453
But otherwise, thank you so much.

578
00:59:45,074 --> 00:59:46,335
Fill out the evaluation forms.

579
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,236
It helps out the conference.

580
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:47,717
So thank you.
