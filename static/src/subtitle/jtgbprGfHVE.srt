1
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:10,528
This is Don't Change a Thing, the challenges of evolving solitaire.

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:15,072
Thank you for coming. I'm super excited about what I have to present. I hope that you will love it.

3
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:21,098
My name is Russell Carroll. A little bit about me. Well, I like to go by the name Russ.

4
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:25,883
And I like green. I also like Nintendo. I came up as a producer and designer.

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,732
So you'll hear a lot of design background and producer

6
00:00:29,772 --> 00:00:30,132
background.

7
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:34,314
The thing I like most, the title I like most, is vision

8
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:34,654
holder.

9
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:36,896
I like to think about projects from the beginning all the way

10
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,757
to the end and try to encapsulate that.

11
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:42,279
And then I have a lot of awesome people I work with to

12
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,019
make it all happen.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,881
I'm old by GDC standards.

14
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,422
This is my 14th GDC.

15
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,444
So I guess that makes me old.

16
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:51,424
I have some gray hairs.

17
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:53,806
And I love fun.

18
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,473
This series of icons you see here are from games I worked on before I joined my current employer.

19
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:03,875
You'll notice a theme, which is some planes and googly eyes.

20
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,297
I used to say, if it doesn't say fun, it needs to be redone.

21
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:10,939
It was just a quick phrase for me because I love things that were happy.

22
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,741
And I also like making games for everyone. Some people call these casual games.

23
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:21,925
Games for everyone works for me, and that's the main reason I work at my current employer, Mobilityware, an awesome place.

24
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:24,346
That's enough about me. About it. Solitaire!

25
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:34,707
Solitaire has had over 270 years of playtime today and

26
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:35,568
every day.

27
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,450
We've got over 200 million downloads across

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,270
Android and iOS.

29
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,292
The game is the number two installed game on iOS.

30
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:50,953
And if you remember when Pokemon Go came out?

31
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:52,504
Everyone was playing it.

32
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,787
And there was a company that did a quick look at the market

33
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,930
to determine how much people were playing it

34
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,791
versus everything else.

35
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:02,435
And they released the top five games played on iOS.

36
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:06,900
When they did that, we were happy and not super surprised

37
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,822
to see that Solitaire was actually

38
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,903
the number three game played.

39
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:13,647
And the number four game played was our Spider Solitaire.

40
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:18,054
So these games may not be quite as flashy

41
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:19,414
as some of the ones you have heard about.

42
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:22,535
We have massive numbers of people playing our game,

43
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,095
which is a great opportunity

44
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:25,516
and also presents some challenges

45
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:26,416
that we'll talk about today.

46
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:28,636
Some more about it.

47
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,177
When I say the word solitaire,

48
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:32,957
I often refer to five games.

49
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,797
We have a solitaire suite of five different apps.

50
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:38,638
They are TriPeaks, Spyder, FreeCell, Pyramid, and Klondike.

51
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,779
Klondike is the one that everyone calls Spyder,

52
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:41,839
or sorry, solitaire.

53
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,926
except some people may call patients those of you from the

54
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:47,367
UK and other places.

55
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,568
There are 16 SKUs.

56
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:54,651
We have those on Amazon, Apple, and on Google.

57
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:57,473
I run two different teams doing the

58
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,313
development for the game.

59
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:00,635
And that is across three development environments.

60
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:04,457
We work in native iOS, we work in native Android, and then

61
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:05,257
also in Unity.

62
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:09,191
And to the question of, are you still developing this game?

63
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,733
The answer is an emphatic yes.

64
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:13,195
We had 40 updates across the suite last year.

65
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:15,377
We're going to have more than that many this year.

66
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:18,380
Some of those updates are small, but we try,

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,123
I try really hard to have a feature in every single update.

68
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:23,745
So yes, we're still developing a lot,

69
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:25,787
which gets into about my job.

70
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,650
When I tell people I make Solitaire,

71
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,232
I usually get the question of, well, what do you really do?

72
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:35,314
Great salt has already been developed it's been around for

73
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:39,836
a long time what's your job. Well when I was getting hired I

74
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:40,977
was told what I was going to be doing.

75
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,079
And that is add features to solitaire

76
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,200
add users to solitaire

77
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,542
and don't mess up the revenue.

78
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,044
Yeah a little bit of fear there.

79
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,214
So this actually creates the first challenge in working

80
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,094
with this large title.

81
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:01,677
And that is, how do we make changes that increase the

82
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,700
revenue without making changes that decrease the revenue?

83
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,362
I'm going to start telling you about the second challenge.

84
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:08,683
And to do that, I have to tell you about her.

85
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:10,625
This is Lisa.

86
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,066
It's a pretty good likeness.

87
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:12,667
This is Lisa.

88
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,549
I met Lisa when I was in a parking lot.

89
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,392
We were both picking up our sons.

90
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,545
not shared we're picking up our sons and so we're waiting and we got to talking

91
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:27,510
and is usually the case she asked what I do and I said well I make games

92
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:30,314
and she said oh well I I don't play games so this is

93
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:31,835
Lisa not a gamer.

94
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,958
And then she found out I made Solitaire.

95
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,880
And she was ecstatic.

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,201
She got so excited.

97
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:42,503
She's like, I love Solitaire.

98
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:45,385
And she went on and on about how much she enjoys it.

99
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,988
Specifically, she loves a feature called Daily Challenges.

100
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,089
Daily Challenges is a feature where we have

101
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,031
a new winnable deal every day.

102
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,152
And there's a calendar.

103
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:57,033
You can win the deal if you check off

104
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,434
the calendar for that day.

105
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,416
If you complete enough deals within a month,

106
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,416
you get a big trophy.

107
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:04,959
he complete more deals you get bigger trophy nearly all the deals in the month

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,281
you really big trophy we call that gold

109
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:09,383
pretty straightforward stuff

110
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:14,427
she told me about how much you love the game and then she said

111
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:17,830
don't change a thing

112
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:20,512
don't you anything

113
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:21,753
now this is

114
00:05:22,554 --> 00:05:25,757
an irony right because if we haven't changed anything

115
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:28,959
the future she loved wouldn't have existed

116
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,801
we would never made it to begin with

117
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,361
And so this is really that second major challenge we deal

118
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,843
with in our game, and I'm sure many of you do in your games,

119
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:39,545
which is we have customers who resist change.

120
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:41,106
They tell you they don't want change,

121
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,628
but we also need to make changes.

122
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:45,649
And so these create a tension.

123
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,513
So these are the two challenges.

124
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,594
Players resist change.

125
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:54,135
Companies, they only want positive changes.

126
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:56,657
The question is, how do you handle those challenges?

127
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:58,719
They're not unique to us,

128
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,760
so you can kind of ponder how you do it.

129
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,513
I'm gonna go through some of the effort that we do.

130
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,976
And that is a focused effort to first off,

131
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:10,881
protect the player, and then to protect the revenue.

132
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:13,144
Let's talk about protecting the player.

133
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:14,746
And the way I'm gonna first talk about this

134
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,429
is with in-game surveys.

135
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,111
I love in-game surveys.

136
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:19,493
I hope that you're using them.

137
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,617
I've heard a couple of people talk about them but no one who

138
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:23,958
really was using them a lot.

139
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,559
So let me tell you what we did with them.

140
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,561
To do that, I need to first tell you about a feature we

141
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,543
put into Solitaire FreeCell last year called progression.

142
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,346
Now this feature was actually a multitude of smaller features

143
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,006
all put together.

144
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:39,747
The first is that we have XP.

145
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,949
So every time you complete a deal, we give you XP.

146
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,531
You can see there's an XP bar, normal meter.

147
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:50,919
We also have daily goals. Each day there were three goals, an easy, a medium and a hard goal.

148
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:54,461
You get XP for completing the deal, you get XP for completing a goal,

149
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:57,924
and if you complete all three goals in one day, you get even more XP.

150
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,565
So there's a bonus that you're working towards.

151
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:03,268
There are levels, so you can level up, you can be level 14, level 42.

152
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:07,290
And lastly, there are titles.

153
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,812
These are mostly just for fun, but they provide a goalpost.

154
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:12,094
That's kind of the idea behind all of these, is creating

155
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:15,277
goalposts, creating a progression for users that they

156
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,058
can move through.

157
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:19,301
So every five levels, you would potentially earn a title.

158
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:22,404
So let's go back to in-game surveys.

159
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:25,227
When we released this feature, we wanted to know how

160
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:26,449
customers felt about it.

161
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,831
We want to protect the customer.

162
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,475
In order to do that, we need to understand, how's the

163
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:31,276
customer feeling?

164
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:32,177
What do they say?

165
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:32,958
What do they think?

166
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,341
And in-game surveys are a great way to do this.

167
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:36,823
They're unfiltered from a player.

168
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:41,105
where you go to a review and you might have to put your name on it

169
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:47,208
and the consumer might be a little scared to let their friend know how they really feel about a game.

170
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,690
When we get a survey response back, they are very honest.

171
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,931
They're brutally honest.

172
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:55,033
They will tell us exactly what they think and how much they hate us.

173
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:56,413
So this is good.

174
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:59,046
We get more information.

175
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:00,828
In fact, six times more information.

176
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:04,413
So this means that when we ran this particular survey,

177
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:08,319
we get six times as many people who responded to this survey

178
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,362
as who wrote in reviews.

179
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:11,664
Okay?

180
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:13,807
So, more data, much better.

181
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,395
It's also targeted.

182
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,436
We were able to write the questions to get the

183
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:20,317
information we wanted.

184
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,998
So we didn't have to parse through all the reviews and

185
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,578
say, well, what are they talking about and what are

186
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:24,179
they talking about?

187
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:27,640
We were able to drive the users to specifically what we

188
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,421
wanted to talk about.

189
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:31,174
And they're super easy to do.

190
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,394
The way we did this, we actually used SurveyMonkey.

191
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:35,174
So nothing hard, right?

192
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:37,335
We created a survey in SurveyMonkey.

193
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:41,416
And we have a file up on a server that has that URL in

194
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:41,896
the file.

195
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:44,056
And it also has a couple of other pieces of information.

196
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:45,897
We just change that link.

197
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,497
And we change the other information.

198
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:49,157
And it puts the survey in the game.

199
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,238
It shows up in a web view.

200
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:52,318
The players can respond right there.

201
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:53,218
That's it.

202
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:54,219
It's that easy.

203
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,639
Because it's in SurveyMonkey, we can immediately go and

204
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:57,399
analyze the data.

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,580
How did we do it?

206
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:05,999
We had a 5 question survey we started with 4 like or scale questions if you're not familiar to like or scale a big fan of it.

207
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:15,605
The scale you have a statement and then the player responds by saying whether they strongly agree agree neither agree nor disagree.

208
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,356
disagree or strongly disagree with your statement.

209
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:21,318
We broke out those four questions into two parts,

210
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:24,040
two about progression and two about the UI,

211
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,542
which we had to change as we did progression.

212
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:28,103
I wouldn't recommend, by the way,

213
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,444
doing those two things at the same time,

214
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,645
but we had to in this case, so there it is.

215
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,627
The last was a comment box,

216
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:35,568
and this allowed users to say whatever they wanted

217
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,810
about whatever they wanted, and they did.

218
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,933
We ran the survey for about two weeks.

219
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,615
We got many, many thousands of answers.

220
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,178
many, many, many thousands of data points.

221
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,719
And then we analyzed it.

222
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,162
This is actually a word cloud of the comment box data

223
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:53,642
that we got.

224
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,363
It's not really useful, but it's kind of pretty,

225
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,484
so threw it up there.

226
00:09:57,544 --> 00:10:00,186
We looked at the trends and the opportunities

227
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,647
that we identified from what people had said.

228
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,949
And then we pulled the team together.

229
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:05,529
We had a meeting.

230
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,716
We talked about the problems.

231
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,677
We brainstormed ideas.

232
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,698
And then we put in together a plan

233
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,459
of how we were gonna address the feedback.

234
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,180
We'd spent many, many months putting together this feature.

235
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:20,522
We'd now gotten back what the customers thought about it,

236
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:21,482
how they felt about it,

237
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,924
what they were saying about it very honestly.

238
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:28,386
And we went out on a two-week development plan.

239
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:29,426
It's not even two weeks.

240
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,548
We planned for one week of engineering time

241
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,828
and a week of QA time.

242
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:38,482
All right, so we dove right in to try to improve things.

243
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:39,903
And I'll tell you how we did.

244
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:43,745
When we first released our progression feature, based on

245
00:10:43,785 --> 00:10:47,187
the survey data, 80% of our users liked we were positive

246
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,289
neutral towards the information we had in there.

247
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,391
They liked it, but 20% didn't like it.

248
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,451
That's one in five.

249
00:10:53,772 --> 00:10:55,012
That's not a really good number.

250
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,215
So we took this one week period to try to fix that,

251
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,617
which is kind of crazy, because that's not enough time

252
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:02,517
to do a whole lot.

253
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:03,838
But we did.

254
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,418
By just listening to what the players were saying,

255
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,740
by protecting the players, by understanding what they wanted,

256
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,422
we were able to cut that number in half

257
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:15,306
so that the next release, and it took the weeks with the QA

258
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:17,088
and then getting the data and whatnot,

259
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:20,813
was 90% of our players liked what we were doing.

260
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,134
That's a huge change.

261
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:26,863
other way to protect the players a be testing I'm sure all of you do this if

262
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:28,346
you if you don't shame on you

263
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:34,416
I like to a be tested I like to be test features not whether or not the pony

264
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,901
should be blue or red I like to identify should we have a pony all.

265
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,782
I'm gonna tell you about one test that we did,

266
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,883
which is on the EasyRead card front.

267
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,625
Now, I told you a lot of people have this game installed.

268
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,307
In fact, almost 10%, just a little over 9% of people

269
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,429
who have an iPhone have our Solitaire game on it,

270
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:53,630
which is kind of crazy.

271
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,071
That means about one in 11, which means a number of you do,

272
00:11:56,431 --> 00:12:00,034
and not just because some of my coworkers are here with us,

273
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,375
a number of you probably have this game installed

274
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:02,956
on your phone.

275
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,723
We get anecdotal information because we talk to everyone as

276
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:08,404
we're out and about.

277
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,325
When we see them with their phones, we talk to them, and

278
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:12,165
we see if they have our game.

279
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:14,326
And if they don't have our Solitaire game, and they have

280
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,487
another Solitaire game, we ask them, well, why not?

281
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:17,907
Why don't you have our Solitaire game?

282
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,128
One of the pieces of information we kept getting

283
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,969
back was, it's hard to read your cards.

284
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,010
It's hard to read your cards.

285
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,410
That was a reason why some people weren't

286
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,091
installing our game.

287
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:27,391
They're hard to read.

288
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,873
Now, cards are the character of our game.

289
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,538
there are Mario or Super Mario brothers that may seem strange to say,

290
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:38,999
but our players look at these cards all the time.

291
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,080
That's all they ever see.

292
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,160
That's all they interact with are these cards.

293
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,682
So changing the cards in solitaire,

294
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:48,143
super hard.

295
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,765
When I first joined Mobility Aware and we talked about changing the cards of solitaire,

296
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:54,246
I had people that start shaking their heads and they're saying,

297
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:58,047
you cannot change the cards in solitaire.

298
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,348
Not that you shouldn't, you can't do it.

299
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:01,489
Cannot be done.

300
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:06,134
Well, we want to listen to what our customers want from us.

301
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:07,355
We want to protect those players.

302
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:10,496
And we want to do that not just through listening, but also

303
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,317
seeing the actual data.

304
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,799
Not just what they say, but what do they do.

305
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:16,000
So we did a test.

306
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,581
And we did it as a 50-50 test of new users.

307
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,303
Now, new users, of course, because this means we're not

308
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,324
exposing all of our existing users to it, right?

309
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:24,545
It's safer already.

310
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:28,347
And we did it on Android, which further shrinks down

311
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:28,767
what we're doing.

312
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,150
I'm just going to run through the results really quick,

313
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,070
because it's kind of interesting.

314
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,712
There is a black line you'll see on this graph.

315
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,113
That black line's a baseline.

316
00:13:36,393 --> 00:13:38,094
Anything above that line was an improvement.

317
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:40,075
Below that line was not an improvement.

318
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:43,237
So it's an interesting little piece of graph here.

319
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,078
The blue, if you see, is the phone.

320
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:49,501
For the phone, having this new font increased our retention

321
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:50,281
across the board.

322
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,523
Day one, day seven, day 14, day 28.

323
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,603
Pretty awesome.

324
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,805
For tablets, which is the yellowish orange.

325
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:59,509
It actually didn't increase retention.

326
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:02,770
It decreased retention up until day 28, where it randomly

327
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,250
went way up.

328
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,990
Well, that feels really uncomfortable.

329
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,411
So what we ended up doing is acting on what we felt really

330
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,592
good about, which was we knew on phone this font was making

331
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:14,092
players stick around longer.

332
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,233
It was retaining users better.

333
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:19,393
So we made it the default on phone and made it available to

334
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,574
all of our existing players as well, let them know it was

335
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,974
there, so they could choose to use it.

336
00:14:24,524 --> 00:14:26,226
So that talks about protecting our player.

337
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:29,609
This looks at what they say in in-game surveys

338
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:32,391
and what they do through A-B testing.

339
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,153
I want to go back to the challenges.

340
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:38,456
I said that players resist change.

341
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:41,599
And companies, they only want positive change.

342
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,801
So I want you to think about that for just a moment.

343
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:47,444
As a developer, how does that make you feel?

344
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:50,487
If you're thinking as a developer,

345
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:52,528
I'm gonna make changes, but the players don't want them.

346
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:55,814
And if I do anything wrong, my company's going to get angry at me.

347
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:57,895
How do you feel?

348
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:01,078
Well, the answer is, you feel afraid.

349
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,600
As a developer, you are fearful.

350
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,922
And the response of being fearful is, play it safe.

351
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:09,764
Try not to do anything that will rock the boat.

352
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,307
I heard this when I joined the company.

353
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,948
I'm going to go through a few quotes here.

354
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:18,291
First one, you have to be careful when you talk to management about changes.

355
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,553
I heard that right off the bat when I joined MobilityWare,

356
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,553
which has been some years now.

357
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,457
We once changed the font by one pixel, all.

358
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,958
Notice it's underlined, because all the players complained.

359
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,639
All millions and millions and millions and millions of our

360
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,800
users, they all complained when we changed

361
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,401
the font by one pixel.

362
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,842
These types of stories end up being culture.

363
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,804
They communicate to new employees how you interact

364
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:45,365
with your games and what you can do at the company.

365
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:48,606
In this case, what we were communicating was making the

366
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:52,227
smallest, most minute change was not a good idea.

367
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:53,128
Don't make changes.

368
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:56,580
And lastly, I still hear this one sometimes,

369
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,400
so I'm still working on it,

370
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,944
is you can't change anything on Solitaire.

371
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,066
So you can hear the fear through these, right?

372
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,989
You can hear that there's some discomfort

373
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,310
in trying to make changes.

374
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,479
I'm gonna quote Ed Catmull here multiple times.

375
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,901
He wrote an amazing book called Creativity Inc.

376
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:16,202
about managing creativity.

377
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,523
He's the president of Pixar, if you're not familiar with him.

378
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,444
Now president of Disney Animation.

379
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:24,225
He says, in a fear-based, failure-averse culture,

380
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:28,487
people will consciously or unconsciously avoid risk.

381
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:30,988
They will seek instead to repeat something safe

382
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:32,849
that's been good enough in the past.

383
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,430
And if you're looking at this and you're like,

384
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,231
Russ, what's wrong with safe?

385
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:38,155
Isn't that OK?

386
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,576
What's wrong with it, really?

387
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:40,797
Well, here's the problem.

388
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:41,658
Another quote from him.

389
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:45,060
Copying what's come before is a guaranteed path to

390
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,700
mediocrity.

391
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,604
In our industry, there have been hundreds of games that

392
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,726
have come out on mobile today.

393
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:57,408
There are thousands of games coming out every month.

394
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,150
You cannot afford to be mediocre.

395
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,072
You cannot afford to play it safe and be just like all the

396
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:03,672
other titles.

397
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,494
There are thousands of failing, mediocre, safe

398
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:06,875
titles.

399
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,305
They're failing every day.

400
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:10,986
You've got to stand out.

401
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:14,408
You've got to be willing to make the risks that will help

402
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:15,168
you stand out.

403
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,192
So when I look at the two challenges I talked about

404
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:23,373
earlier, we have making changes versus players who

405
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:24,074
resist change.

406
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:27,096
And the second one was making revenue increasing changes

407
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,717
versus revenue decreasing changes.

408
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,698
I actually think that second one's wrong.

409
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:35,641
The real other challenge is making changes at all versus a

410
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,402
fear of failure.

411
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:44,648
So now we have three ways to address these challenges.

412
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,829
We have protecting the player, protecting the revenue, and

413
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:47,829
defending the developer.

414
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,751
But if you were listening to what I just said, protecting

415
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,773
the player and protecting the revenue comes at the expense

416
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:55,773
of the developer.

417
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:56,533
It makes them fearful.

418
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:59,575
Those two don't work together to create the third.

419
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,156
And if you put all three together, you have a mess.

420
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,577
So what if we protect the revenue and

421
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:05,337
defend the developer?

422
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:08,439
You do that at the expense of the player.

423
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,605
The player leaves, the money goes away.

424
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:12,826
Both of those are fails.

425
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:14,547
So this is my belief.

426
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,130
In order for us to really grow, we need to protect the

427
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,052
player and defend the developer.

428
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,294
And I strongly believe if we do that, we do protect and

429
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:26,895
grow the revenue.

430
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:31,478
Because we allow the developers to try new things

431
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:36,481
and to find opportunities to improve the products.

432
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:38,471
So I'm gonna talk about this.

433
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,112
I'm gonna talk about how we defend the developer.

434
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:41,812
And the first way is with guardrails.

435
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,433
Guardrails are very familiar

436
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:45,394
because a lot of the same things that are guardrails

437
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,215
for our developers are helpful for our customers.

438
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,235
They protect our customers as well.

439
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:54,057
So A-B tests, they provide our developers

440
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,057
a safe place to try things out,

441
00:18:56,317 --> 00:18:58,138
and they also protect our customers

442
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,558
from getting something they might not like.

443
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:01,997
Multiple applications.

444
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,278
I mentioned we have five games that are solitaire games.

445
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,800
We can test a new feature in a smaller title before we roll

446
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,441
into a bigger one.

447
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:09,902
We're not unique in this.

448
00:19:10,262 --> 00:19:10,922
King does this.

449
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:11,963
Supercell does this.

450
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:13,924
It is a very common thing to do.

451
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,000
And then also we have multiple platforms.

452
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,061
If you put this all together, we can put something into a

453
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:23,501
smaller game on a smaller platform, and then A, B, test

454
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:26,242
it down to a small niche of the audience.

455
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,322
We still have a lot of users in that niche, but

456
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:29,443
enough to test it.

457
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:33,083
But what it means is we can create a totally safe test

458
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:33,563
environment.

459
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:36,484
Our developers can feel totally comfortable trying

460
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:40,065
something, and if it doesn't work, that's OK, because we

461
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:41,305
are not risking anything.

462
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:42,365
We are protecting them.

463
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,934
The result of this is really confidence and freedom.

464
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:47,815
This is only the first step.

465
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,138
We've gotta work with our developers as well

466
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,721
in something we call success through failure.

467
00:19:54,741 --> 00:19:56,463
I'm gonna call this failing forward,

468
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,545
which is that we need to have a philosophy

469
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,728
that if we try something new and it doesn't work,

470
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,950
that's okay, in fact, that's what we need to do.

471
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,691
We need to try things that don't work

472
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:07,572
to find the things that do.

473
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:13,259
I'm going to talk about a crash bug that we had.

474
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,421
About three weeks after I joined the company, we were

475
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,125
trying to release a bill just before our company

476
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:19,826
tripped to Hawaii.

477
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,068
Which is a cool thing MobilityWare does.

478
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,155
We had a crash, though, in this build.

479
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,457
We'd already submitted to Apple.

480
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,459
It was sitting there just ready to go live.

481
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,660
But we were testing right up to the last minute because,

482
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,022
well, we needed to get all the testing done.

483
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:37,004
As we did, we found that it was crashing consistently

484
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:37,644
over and over.

485
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,346
So we tried to fix it.

486
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,346
We tried to save it.

487
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,447
We have passionate developers.

488
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:42,208
They want to get it right.

489
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,309
So they tried to save it.

490
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,470
They made new builds, and those builds crashed, and more

491
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,031
builds crashed.

492
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,432
And we thought, well, maybe we can just submit it to Apple.

493
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:51,074
And then when we get back from the trip, we can then be able

494
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:51,595
to go live.

495
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,984
But as we went on through the day, we came to realize that

496
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:57,625
this feature was not well implemented.

497
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,965
We did not do a good job putting this one in.

498
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:02,806
How do you respond to that?

499
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:05,226
If you're a manager, how do you respond to it?

500
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:09,867
If you're a company leader, if you are a team developer, team

501
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:10,928
member, how do you respond to it?

502
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:13,988
There's a lot of ways to respond to it.

503
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,869
I'm going to go back to Ed Catmull for a moment.

504
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:18,810
He says, failure isn't a necessary.

505
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:24,550
evil. In fact, it isn't evil at all. It is a necessary consequence of doing something

506
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:32,056
new. So what we did is we met as a team. We talked about how to fix the problem, and then

507
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:35,818
we put a plan in place and we tried to fix it. The next day, one of the engineers came

508
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:39,000
and he pulled me aside and he said, hey, I wanted to talk to you. He said, you know,

509
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,423
I've worked at a lot of different places, and usually when we do something wrong, we

510
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:43,964
get yelled at.

511
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:45,732
We get screamed at and told like,

512
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:47,332
dude, you totally messed this up.

513
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:48,573
We already know that, right?

514
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,053
But that's what usually happens,

515
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:51,173
is that it was really refreshing

516
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,553
because you just said, how do we fix it?

517
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:53,654
How do we make it right?

518
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,474
And I'm not going to say I'm perfect at this.

519
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:56,114
I am not.

520
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:58,315
But I believe in the principle

521
00:21:58,335 --> 00:21:59,915
and I keep trying to become better at it.

522
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,296
Which is that as we try new things,

523
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:04,716
we should expect that we are not going

524
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:05,837
to get them right all the time.

525
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:08,817
And we should have confidence in our developers.

526
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:10,378
We should have confidence in each other.

527
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:16,783
As we fail forward, what we do is instead of having people who are fearful of making mistakes,

528
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:18,144
which by the way leads to mistakes,

529
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:21,207
we have people who are focused on getting it right.

530
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,891
They're focused on trying new things and making things awesome.

531
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:27,353
To do this, we have to create a culture.

532
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,036
We have to actually say it explicitly.

533
00:22:30,736 --> 00:22:32,338
Whenever I say explicitly, my team giggles.

534
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,100
There's multiple meanings to this word.

535
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,441
What I mean is...

536
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:38,338
We have to specifically state it.

537
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:40,819
We can't just assume that everyone's gonna see us

538
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,380
and they're gonna just absorb that this is our philosophy

539
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,882
because we act a specific way.

540
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,864
We have to specifically state, this is what we want.

541
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:52,406
We want to try things and we want to move forward.

542
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,889
When we released that progression update,

543
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,190
I told you that we met as a team

544
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,270
and looked over the feedback.

545
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,672
The feedback we got, some of it looked like this.

546
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:05,734
I hate the update.

547
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:06,134
Hate it.

548
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,775
You absolutely ruined my enjoyment of playing.

549
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:12,116
I have a whole lot of these.

550
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,757
I could spend an hour just going through them, and many

551
00:23:14,777 --> 00:23:15,977
of them are not fit for reading.

552
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,518
There's another one.

553
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,578
My old high score records are gone.

554
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:21,879
Very disappointing.

555
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,840
Notice they put this in all caps.

556
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,260
I assume that's because it's important to them.

557
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:29,181
Assume.

558
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:34,165
So as we meet and we talk as a team about this type of thing,

559
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:37,347
our lead designer mentioned we need to have

560
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,288
thick skins and soft hearts.

561
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:42,650
That is to say, we're going to be receiving feedback

562
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,711
from the customer directly.

563
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,832
We need to not take it personally,

564
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:47,213
which is hard because we're passionate

565
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:48,554
and we really care about what we're doing.

566
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:49,735
We care about those customers.

567
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:51,916
And that care feeds into the second part,

568
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:52,897
which is the soft hearts.

569
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,278
We need to listen with our hearts,

570
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:57,680
try to understand what are the customers really saying?

571
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:03,196
right? What are they really feeling? How do we help them through this?

572
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:07,380
We also need to remember that we win and lose together as a team.

573
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:11,084
This was a focus. It's really easy when you see this type of feedback to go,

574
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:14,447
I didn't suggest that. Remember when I said not to put that in,

575
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:18,351
it's real easy at this point to bicker about, well,

576
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:23,276
we should just take this out entirely, right? It's failed. It's totally failed.

577
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,156
Give up, move on.

578
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:30,185
What we did is we took it as an opportunity.

579
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:34,370
We met, we identified what people were saying, and we

580
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,391
responded directly to it.

581
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:36,232
Here's a quick example.

582
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,214
In the top right-hand corner, you're going to see that

583
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:38,734
there's a button.

584
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:41,397
It's a kind of a round, long oval with a star in it and a

585
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:42,078
number next to it.

586
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,140
This is where you get to the leaderboards

587
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,081
after we made our update.

588
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,884
This button doesn't look like any of the other

589
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,585
buttons in the game.

590
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,155
It was moved from the toolbar at the bottom to the top.

591
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:54,056
It used to be just one big star.

592
00:24:54,116 --> 00:24:55,396
Now it's a star with a number next to it.

593
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:58,317
And our customers, many of them, couldn't find it.

594
00:24:58,477 --> 00:24:59,198
They didn't know where it was.

595
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:00,858
They could not find their high scores.

596
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:02,159
They could not get into the leaderboards.

597
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:05,086
So this one's kind of an easy change.

598
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,388
We changed that to be just a big star button.

599
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:08,529
And then we put an overlay on it.

600
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,612
And it pointed up and said, hey, here's the button.

601
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:13,795
On the left side, you'll notice that there is a gear.

602
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:15,376
Now that's our Settings button.

603
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:16,017
It's pretty obvious.

604
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:19,801
We moved it a level under when we did the UI, one level back.

605
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:20,882
And guess what?

606
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:22,463
Some players couldn't find it.

607
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:24,184
We'd had discussions about whether or not we should do

608
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:24,924
this ahead of time.

609
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:26,765
And we decided to go for it.

610
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:30,126
So when it comes back and it wasn't the right thing, this

611
00:25:30,186 --> 00:25:32,707
is another moment where you can say, I told you it was a

612
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:33,607
bad idea, right?

613
00:25:34,547 --> 00:25:35,608
That's a fail in my mind.

614
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,928
Because what we did is we wanted to try something.

615
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:39,429
It's a safe try.

616
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:40,109
Let's try it.

617
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:41,450
Let's see how the customers respond to it.

618
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,950
Didn't work?

619
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,330
OK.

620
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,410
Well, how do we make it better?

621
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:44,571
And then we made it better.

622
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:47,752
And that's really the focus of everything I've been talking

623
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:50,233
about, is improvement little by little.

624
00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:52,744
And we have improved.

625
00:25:53,264 --> 00:25:55,545
Since I've shared so many negative things, I wanted to

626
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:56,285
share some positive ones.

627
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:00,227
This is how the customers are responding to the progression

628
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:00,687
feature today.

629
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:01,948
I just love it.

630
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,428
I love to do my daily goals.

631
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,089
Brilliant game.

632
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,589
Thank you.

633
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:06,370
And those are kisses, I believe.

634
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,751
I don't think they're trying to cross me out of existence,

635
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,132
but I wonder sometimes.

636
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:13,093
This one.

637
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:15,074
I actually really enjoy the goals.

638
00:26:15,494 --> 00:26:16,154
I wish there were more.

639
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,475
Which tells us what to do next.

640
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:18,615
And this last one.

641
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,896
Now I have got used to the new free cell.

642
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:21,796
It is OK.

643
00:26:26,183 --> 00:26:27,705
And I'm really OK with this one.

644
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:29,927
And the main reason why is because as I look at it,

645
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:33,069
we got to 90% of our customers liking what we were doing.

646
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,712
90% liking plus 10% being OK with what we're doing,

647
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:37,753
that's 100% good.

648
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:44,039
In summary, we have two major challenges that we confront.

649
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,021
We have player resistance to changes.

650
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,344
We have developer fear of failure.

651
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:53,787
And just one big resolution, which is do change things.

652
00:26:56,899 --> 00:26:58,700
We do it in a couple of ways.

653
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,941
First off, we use what players say through surveys.

654
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:04,322
And we also look at emails and reviews, of course.

655
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:07,704
And what they do through A-B testing and all of our data

656
00:27:07,744 --> 00:27:08,224
analytics.

657
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:13,366
We use guardrails to make it safe for our developers so

658
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:15,647
they can feel comfortable trying things out.

659
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:17,528
And then we encourage failures.

660
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:18,568
That's part of learning.

661
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:20,029
It should be part of learning.

662
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,449
That's how we try new things.

663
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,691
If you are not able to fail, you're not

664
00:27:24,771 --> 00:27:25,671
trying new enough things.

665
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:26,251
You're not trying.

666
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:29,628
things that are going to be more impactful enough for your company.

667
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,911
Some cool stuff if you like this by the way,

668
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:35,354
creativity Inc. I quoted it multiple times.

669
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:37,916
I had like more quotes that I cut out of this slide presentation.

670
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:38,957
There's so many good quotes in there.

671
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:39,918
Absolutely love the book.

672
00:27:40,418 --> 00:27:40,898
Intuition.

673
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,913
intuition pumps and other tools for thinking.

674
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,116
This is Daniel Dennett, who is a philosopher.

675
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,099
There's a piece in there about how mistakes

676
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:49,521
are the only way we learn,

677
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,705
which I think's a really fascinating concept.

678
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:54,188
And then Make Good Art by Neil Gaiman,

679
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,952
which is a commencement speech that he gave.

680
00:27:57,835 --> 00:27:59,617
You can just check that online super easy.

681
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:01,439
If you'd like to talk about this kind of stuff,

682
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,340
please be in touch with me.

683
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,381
My name is Russell Carroll.

684
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,024
I work at MobilityWare, as mentioned.

685
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,446
And speaking of, we are looking for people

686
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,367
who want to change things.

687
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:11,089
So if you are passionate about customers

688
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,210
and love trying new things,

689
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:14,032
also enjoy fun environments

690
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:15,834
where it is sunny all the time in SoCal.

691
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:16,835
Give us a ring.

692
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:19,498
And with that, thanks for coming.

693
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:28,897
I have two minutes, so if there's anyone who wants to

694
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:30,861
jump on, I think I have enough time for one question.

695
00:28:32,484 --> 00:28:34,347
If there's anyone who wants to jump for dinner, this is the

696
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:35,008
time to run.

697
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:42,513
The question is, how big is the Solitaire team?

698
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,273
So there are two Solitaire teams.

699
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:48,555
And the first team is about 14 people.

700
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:51,055
And the other team is maybe six, seven.

701
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:52,716
Those are the core client teams.

702
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,896
We also do a fair amount of server work.

703
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,217
And that is held through tools teams.

704
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:59,578
We also have monetization work that is done through a

705
00:28:59,598 --> 00:29:00,338
separate team as well.

706
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:02,378
So if I start totaling everything together, it

707
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,399
actually ends up being quite a large number of people.

708
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:06,219
Many of those work on multiple projects.

709
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,160
Please.

710
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:14,011
Quick question. When you're talking about receiving feedback from your surveys,

711
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:20,401
do you get most of that feedback and ideas from like the agree, strongly agree, disagree

712
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:23,566
statements or from the free form comments?

713
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:26,296
So the question is, where do we get most of the information

714
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:26,956
back from the surveys?

715
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:29,758
Is it from the questions with the specific

716
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:31,038
answers or the free form?

717
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,320
And we get it in both places.

718
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,761
The free form obviously gives us lots of trends to look at

719
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:36,562
and specific data.

720
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:40,544
The questions with the specific answers give me trends.

721
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:43,746
So when we did the first one versus the second one,

722
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:45,968
this is how I can tell the 80 versus the 90%, right?

723
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:48,329
So I'm looking at both the data of what are people saying

724
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,811
and how does that relate over time

725
00:29:51,051 --> 00:29:51,891
is usually where I get those.

726
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:54,673
Most of the information is gonna be in the comments

727
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:55,514
that we act on.

728
00:29:55,534 --> 00:30:01,697
All right, I think that is all we have time for.

729
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,579
Please fill out your evaluation forms,

730
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,059
let me know what I should change.

731
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,420
And thank you.
