1
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,214
Everybody, welcome to the end of GDC.

2
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:15,096
My name is Roy McGraw.

3
00:00:15,096 --> 00:00:18,178
I'm a writer, producer, and designer at Pixelberry Studios.

4
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:20,639
This is Kara Liu.

5
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:23,741
She is lead writer and studio manager at Pixelberry.

6
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,902
Before we get started, a little bit of bookkeeping.

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:34,006
We don't look too crowded, but we do have some gameplay footage with somewhat small

8
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:34,087
text.

9
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:38,656
and you want to read it, you may want to move forward.

10
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,318
Other than that, we're supposed to remind you to turn off cell phones,

11
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:43,158
so, you know, vibrate.

12
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:49,702
How many of you guys are familiar with High School Story?

13
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:52,864
That's a good number, that's a good number.

14
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:59,928
Okay, hopefully the talk today will help illuminate why we do some of the things that we do.

15
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:02,629
For the rest of you guys, let's do a little bit of a

16
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:03,270
introduction.

17
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:10,896
Alright, High School Story is a high school simulation game that's available for iOS and

18
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:11,336
Google Play.

19
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:17,058
In High School Story, you create the high school of your dreams.

20
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,199
You can choose your clique.

21
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:22,580
This is jocks, preps, and nerds.

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,801
You can throw parties with your friends.

23
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:26,842
You can go on dates.

24
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:30,843
You can send your classmates on dates.

25
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:33,844
You can dress up like a witch and party with a vampire.

26
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:42,059
All right, so the thing that most differentiates High School Story from the other apps in the

27
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,501
market is the story.

28
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:48,604
A lot of games, they pay lip service to story.

29
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:53,367
What they would call story, we would call maybe a setup, an introduction.

30
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:58,911
It'd be the land that you inherit, the store you decide to open.

31
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:02,734
But in High School Story, we really put the story in High School Story.

32
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:06,936
So there's not just a little bit of story either.

33
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:11,039
We have over a thousand unique quests.

34
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,541
We have hundreds of scripted dates and breakups.

35
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,283
All in all, we're talking over 200,000 words.

36
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:21,565
So to just put that in a little bit of perspective,

37
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:23,747
that gets you two pretty robust young adult novels.

38
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:23,987
All right.

39
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:29,170
So what does the story in High School Story actually look like?

40
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,151
So we have an example.

41
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:32,875
This is a quest log from the game.

42
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,436
This is actually my personal quest log

43
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:35,817
that I'm playing through right now.

44
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:38,340
So you can see on the left, there are different icons

45
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,581
that indicate the different stories going on.

46
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:42,924
So each of these represents a quest chain.

47
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:44,185
It's kind of an ongoing story

48
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,646
made up of several little quests.

49
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:49,129
So first, my band is playing at a music festival,

50
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,111
kind of a big deal.

51
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:55,335
My friends are throwing Kimmy a Sweet 16 birthday party.

52
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:58,357
I'm sending some people out on some dates, playing Cupid.

53
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,350
And then my friends are also throwing a spring fling dance.

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,851
So you can see we try to have a lot of different things going

55
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:06,432
on in the game.

56
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:09,072
So it's multiple story tracks that people can check back in

57
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:09,913
on every time they come.

58
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:14,854
And also, after people collect on any given quest link in the

59
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:17,855
chain, you get a little clip of dialogue playing between

60
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:18,536
the characters.

61
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,996
And so I'll show you a quick example of that.

62
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:23,317
So this is what plays when you collect on

63
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:24,438
the spring fling quest.

64
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,718
And this is kind of the set up for the story.

65
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:28,439
You'll see two of the characters interacting.

66
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:55,551
And it kind of launches you into the narrative of what's about to happen over the course of this spring fling.

67
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:19,169
I'll see ya.

68
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:52,051
Don't forget to click like and subscribe!

69
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:58,043
So you can see from this clip that the story is pretty substantial.

70
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:00,404
We don't just give you the bare minimum set up of, you know,

71
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:01,604
oh, you should buy some flowers.

72
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:04,605
We really want to show the characters and we want to show them coming into

73
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,626
conflict with each other and we want to put you right in the middle of that.

74
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:13,328
So in addition to that, we also are releasing two to three new questions every single week.

75
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:16,869
So you can imagine that's a lot of adventures that our cast has gone on so far.

76
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:19,750
Here are some examples of things we've done.

77
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,432
We've done a ski trip, Olympics, spring fling, most recently a St. Patrick's Day.

78
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,869
And yeah, so it just is ongoing in that way.

79
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:27,429
All right.

80
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:31,352
So the important thing to know about High School Story

81
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:33,834
is that we don't just have a lot of story.

82
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,275
We're not just cramming story in there.

83
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:39,298
Story informs every single design decision

84
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,579
that we've made.

85
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,861
So just as an example, this is the core game

86
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,382
loop in High School Story.

87
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:47,263
You enroll students.

88
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,184
Students earn coins.

89
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:50,566
You spend the coins to buy Hangouts.

90
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,328
Hangouts have slots to allow you to enroll more students.

91
00:05:53,805 --> 00:05:59,569
That's not like crazy, you know, it could be in another game it might be something like

92
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,051
plant crops, you sell the crops for coins, that gets you seeds, you can plant them and

93
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:04,711
get more crops.

94
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:10,835
So it's all pretty basic stuff with one pretty dramatic exception.

95
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:17,739
Here you can see the core game loop is constrained within story.

96
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:19,340
So what exactly does that mean?

97
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:25,575
Playing High School Story, basically, the story is mandatory.

98
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,855
Story Gates leveling.

99
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:32,697
You can't get from level one to level two without playing through some story, but you

100
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:36,479
also can't get to level 20 from level 19 without playing through some story.

101
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,159
Story Gates new clicks.

102
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,780
At the beginning, I showed you jocks, preps, nerds.

103
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,001
Well, we've got some other ones too.

104
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,162
We have artists, slackers, rebels, musicians.

105
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:49,783
We have all the various types of students you can get if you party those together.

106
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,304
Well, to see any of those.

107
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:56,177
you're going to have to play through some story.

108
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:59,659
The final thing that story gates,

109
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:02,761
and this is actually the big idea,

110
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,061
what we're hoping to convey today,

111
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,562
is that story gates more story.

112
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:09,344
So, you might be asking yourselves,

113
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:10,064
why do we do this?

114
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,785
200,000 words is a ton of words,

115
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,867
a thousand unique quest events,

116
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,708
that's a ton of extra complexity.

117
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,908
And you're absolutely right,

118
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:18,309
it is a lot of extra complexity.

119
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:21,871
It's one of the reasons we haven't localized the title yet.

120
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:29,174
But we've done sort of the math internally, the pros and the cons, and we think it's absolutely

121
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:29,874
worth it.

122
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:35,955
So, you know, if you just take a look at this top-down view of the world, you can move buildings

123
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,916
around, you can tap on students, you can change their clothes.

124
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,016
That's really fun.

125
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,577
You're kind of like a god with your own, like, perfect high school.

126
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:46,997
But the problem is, you're kind of at an emotional remove.

127
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:49,718
We want to take the player out of this top-down view.

128
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:57,153
view and make them feel like they're actually a student at this sort of idealized high school.

129
00:07:57,153 --> 00:08:03,177
So we use story to do that. Once we get them down there, once we give them these story-based

130
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:09,921
best friends, these story-based romantic interests, once we've gotten that connection, then we

131
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:16,245
can use story to evolve their romance or maybe put their best friend in a bind.

132
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,971
Once we've got that, we've got them really anticipating

133
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:21,573
what's gonna happen next in the story.

134
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,614
And once they're doing that,

135
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:26,796
we're absolutely sure they're gonna come back.

136
00:08:26,796 --> 00:08:28,197
We're gonna get to our retention numbers

137
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:29,738
kind of towards the end of the talk.

138
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:32,940
If any of you guys saw Andrew Schwarz's talk

139
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,002
earlier in the week, you'll know they're pretty good,

140
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:36,463
so definitely stick around for those.

141
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:37,604
All right, so for now I'll talk a little bit more

142
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:42,988
about both the tools that we use to create this narrative

143
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,129
and also how we set up our team to do it.

144
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:49,070
So first off, we have a unique studio structure.

145
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,412
Out of 16 employees, we have eight writers.

146
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:54,434
And this is the team that's dedicated to crafting the ongoing narrative.

147
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,634
And so why do we have eight?

148
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,837
Well, this is not necessarily a magic number.

149
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:01,879
We've just found that this is what works for us.

150
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,501
So some of the reasons why include brainstorms.

151
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:08,183
We've found that any given writer, if you give them a prompt,

152
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:11,025
you know, write about the spring dance, they will be able to do that.

153
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:16,236
But if you really want the story to go further and you want to make sure you're telling the best story that you can at

154
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:21,561
this particular moment, it's good to have people to bounce ideas off of. So maybe one person will say,

155
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,165
oh, you know, Autumn made that New Year's resolution where she wanted to try new things.

156
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,989
Maybe we should have her try to do it. And someone else might say, well, Peyton's not going to like that because she usually

157
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:35,254
plans all the dances. And then suddenly you have a conflict and, you know, people are working together to come up with that.

158
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,296
Another reason is just for editorial and review.

159
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,356
This is pretty basic.

160
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,097
You don't want a lot of typos in your game.

161
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,797
You don't want grammar errors.

162
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:45,798
All of those work to throw the audience out of the game.

163
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:49,039
So you want them immersed in it and feeling like these are real characters talking to them.

164
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,820
You don't want them thinking, oh, the writer messed up and put a typo in there.

165
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,801
And the last reason for us is that we're able to subdivide people up into groups.

166
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:00,582
So we don't necessarily have every writer working on every quest.

167
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:03,703
I used this example earlier of my quest log.

168
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:12,138
And so obviously you know you wouldn't necessarily want all eight riders trying to write about one spring fling as too many riders.

169
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:14,660
But you can kind of divide them up.

170
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,984
So what we do is we put groups of two to three riders in each of these quests.

171
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:23,047
So maybe one group is writing about the quest chain about making your band.

172
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,869
Maybe another group is writing about the spring fling and so on.

173
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,991
Alright, so getting into the narrative tools that we use.

174
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:33,996
So this is kind of an overview and we'll go through each of these in more detail.

175
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,576
But the ones that we want to focus on today are characters, romance and drama, comedy,

176
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:42,039
choices, and cliffhangers.

177
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,362
And if you do all of these correctly, and we feel that we did in High School Story,

178
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:50,508
then you end up with heartthrobs, emotional engagement, viral screenshots that people

179
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,710
want to share, and player investment.

180
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,393
All right, so let's start with characters.

181
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:01,044
We in high school story rely on a lot of stereotypes when we're introducing characters.

182
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:04,825
And stereotypes are something that you usually hear spoken of very negatively.

183
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:08,486
People will say something is stereotypical if they feel like they've seen it before.

184
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,966
It's nothing new to them. It's kind of played out.

185
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,947
But when you're trying to pack a lot of story into a small space,

186
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,467
like how you're doing when you write for games,

187
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,708
you don't want the story to take over or get in the way of the gameplay.

188
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,069
You really want to tell the story quickly, at least in the beginning,

189
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,229
and then kind of get out of the way.

190
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,631
The worst thing you can see is a player spamming through dialogue

191
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:27,652
because they feel like they just want to get to playing the game.

192
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,273
And that's particularly bad for a game like High School Story,

193
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,774
where the story is so much of the gameplay.

194
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:35,635
So what we try to do is pack it in tightly in the beginning

195
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:38,396
when you're introducing things, and then let it expand more

196
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:39,857
when you have more time with players.

197
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:43,118
So we use stereotypes to introduce the characters,

198
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,219
but then we build on them later in later quests.

199
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:48,480
So here is a classic example from film.

200
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,981
This is The Breakfast Club.

201
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:56,116
So people hopefully can recognize some of the high school tropes that are pretty common.

202
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,338
You see the guy in the letterman's jacket and you think he's a jock.

203
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:02,460
You see the guy with the long hair and the leather gloves and you're like he's probably

204
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,720
a bad boy and so on.

205
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,883
The important thing is everything from how they're dressed to their postures to their

206
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:13,966
hair tells you something about these characters that you can immediately glean without even

207
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,587
necessarily hearing them talk.

208
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,207
So we use kind of those same strategies.

209
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:21,520
For that, I will introduce you to Julian.

210
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,661
He is one of our leading heartthrob characters in High School Story.

211
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,603
You can probably tell from his letterman's jacket that he's a jock,

212
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:32,824
and you can hopefully tell from the football under his arm that he loves football.

213
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:36,406
And based on those two things, you might kind of conclude that he's an alpha male,

214
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:39,587
he's probably pretty competitive, things like that.

215
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:42,488
And that's exactly how we introduced Julian to the audience

216
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,649
when we first introduced him in High School Story.

217
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,908
you meet him as a character who wants to transfer to your school

218
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,068
because he's having problems with his current school's football team.

219
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,709
Because of some politics with the coach, he's not being allowed to play,

220
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,210
he really wants to come to your school if you'll let him start a football team there.

221
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,272
So through the course of getting to meet him, you know, that's pretty much where we leave it.

222
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:06,172
You recruit him to your school, you start this football team,

223
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:09,573
and it's only once he's in your school that we start to dig deeper with his character

224
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,174
and introduce more contradictions and quirks to the stereotype.

225
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:14,838
So once you get to know him a little better,

226
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:17,039
you find out that he's actually really worried

227
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,620
about paying for college.

228
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,022
He doesn't get the chance to decorate often,

229
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,604
but when you kind of push him to decorate for a school dance,

230
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,165
he really enjoys that.

231
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,187
And he also really wants to be a better student,

232
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,388
but he's not quite sure how to go about doing that.

233
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:32,771
So these are all traits you wouldn't necessarily assume

234
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,772
go along with being a jock, and hopefully

235
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,673
will they contradict the stereotype

236
00:13:36,673 --> 00:13:38,635
in a meaningful enough way that people

237
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:41,056
are able to see him as a fully fleshed out character.

238
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:47,793
All right, so one of the metrics that you use, obviously,

239
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,034
to determine if players are understanding

240
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:53,375
and beginning to engage with your game

241
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,636
is tutorial completion.

242
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,597
So we're using what players are bringing into the game,

243
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:01,458
their own experiences, in order to sort of set the stage,

244
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,619
let them feel comfortable with what's happening.

245
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:07,081
And then after that, we're sort of evolving it.

246
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,781
Now, is it working?

247
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,022
Well,

248
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:16,323
a pretty good, something you might shoot for, tutorial completion would be around 70%.

249
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:21,865
In High School Story, using these techniques, we've gotten our tutorial completion up to 87%.

250
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:28,107
And then, once they're through the tutorial, they basically have some buy-in.

251
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:29,807
We're probably going to have some time with them.

252
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:33,286
So our average first time play session is 19.6 minutes.

253
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,287
That means we can introduce a character,

254
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,448
leave them pretty flat at the start,

255
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:40,470
and then know and trust that we'll have the time

256
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,631
to sort of deepen that character over the next 20 minutes.

257
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:44,612
Yep, so just to summarize,

258
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:49,834
make sure you evolve your characters

259
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:51,995
after you introduce them.

260
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,036
If you are going to use stereotypes,

261
00:14:54,036 --> 00:14:55,997
then make sure you use them sparingly.

262
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,974
And so we've told you that this makes players care.

263
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,515
And so I have a couple examples of what players are saying

264
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,736
about Julian in the game.

265
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,298
These are some player reactions that we've

266
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,480
spotted on Twitter and on forums.

267
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,621
One person just checking Julian out, saying he looks hot.

268
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:12,323
Another player has asked a question,

269
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,464
in one of the quests where you get to make your band,

270
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,365
Julian is your drummer.

271
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:17,466
And you find out he's maybe not the best drummer.

272
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:19,468
And you have a chance to kick him out of your band.

273
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:20,869
And maybe you'll have a better chance

274
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:22,050
at winning the music festival.

275
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,671
But this player is really in a dilemma

276
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:24,952
because.

277
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:30,099
is she says she really wants to win, but she doesn't want Julian to be angry with her.

278
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:33,360
And so you can see she's really treating him like an emotional person that is going to

279
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,680
be interacting with her that she's accountable to.

280
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,881
Another thing is because we have dating in our game, and because you can date Julian,

281
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:43,562
we've found that Julian has a number of girlfriends throughout the world, and they like to post

282
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:45,223
about how they are dating Julian on Twitter.

283
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:46,563
These are just a few examples.

284
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:49,944
And they also get really excited when they find out that other people are dating Julian

285
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,884
too, which is kind of a funny response.

286
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:56,480
So just people saying, I have a boyfriend, his name is Julian, we're online official.

287
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,864
Next I want to talk a little bit about how we build up these contradictions in the characters

288
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,346
and how we move away from the stereotypes.

289
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:10,090
So we want to make sure the way you're getting to know the characters all happens very true to life.

290
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,695
You don't just want someone to come up and tell you, oh actually I have all these insecurities.

291
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,016
That's not how people operate in real life.

292
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,677
So that's also not how we do it in the game.

293
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,150
To do it, we try to tell stories that have emotional heft,

294
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,551
and we want to make sure that any time people are playing

295
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,652
through a quest and they're investing that time,

296
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:30,753
they're feeling like there is a social consequence that's

297
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:31,153
coming out of it.

298
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,774
And we want to make sure all the interactions are

299
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,635
in the feeling realistic and genuine to how

300
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:35,515
real people would act.

301
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:39,037
So on the right, you can see Peyton.

302
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,218
She's another character in our game.

303
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,239
And you first meet her as a party girl.

304
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,379
And that's pretty much all you know about her,

305
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,220
is that she likes to throw parties.

306
00:16:47,644 --> 00:16:52,266
She actually introduces our party and game play mechanic, so that probably makes sense.

307
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:55,348
But once you recruit her to your school and you get to know her a little better, you find

308
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,969
out more about her background and her backstory.

309
00:16:56,969 --> 00:17:00,511
So I have a couple of clips that show this and how we do it.

310
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:04,573
I'm just going to show you the beginning and the end of the quest, just so you can see

311
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,074
kind of the movement there.

312
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:10,456
So this first quest is an interaction between you and her, and she is going to an animal

313
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:13,698
adoption event, and both you and her get more than you bargained for.

314
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:27,813
I miss you Antoine

315
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,094
I know but I love you

316
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:34,535
I miss you, Antoine

317
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:35,856
I love you

318
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:41,357
**credits**

319
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:53,340
So the next few quests in this chain you spend running after rabbits and trying to stop a goat from eating everything in your school

320
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:00,527
and just general, the general fun you would have of having a bunch of animals at your school where they're not supposed to be.

321
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:06,513
Then when it's time for the animals to go home, you learn a little bit more about Peyton and why it was so important for her to have those animals.

322
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:13,733
the

323
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,554
the

324
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,557
the

325
00:18:17,557 --> 00:18:20,020
the

326
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,847
the

327
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:27,948
the

328
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:30,411
the

329
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:31,112
the

330
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:57,007
and have a great day.

331
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:20,471
All right, so you can see from that example that Payton's Quest Party Animals, it starts

332
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:30,253
off with you doing something fun in the foreground, but then we go deeper and you learn more about

333
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,053
Payton.

334
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:38,155
So we're both telling the story and we're trying to grow the character.

335
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:43,369
And to give you some context, over 2 million players have chosen to play and complete this quest.

336
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:48,192
Alright, so one last example of building up drama and characters.

337
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:52,635
So this is a special quest that we did about the topic of cyberbullying.

338
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:56,498
So I don't know how many people are familiar with the issue of cyberbullying,

339
00:19:56,498 --> 00:20:01,461
but it's a big problem right now, and it's a problem that not that many people know about

340
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,283
or know the tools to deal with it because it's a relatively new issue.

341
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:08,473
So a lot of teens may be going to their parents and they have no context for what it is

342
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,316
they're saying. Did someone punch you? I don't understand. How are you getting bullied?

343
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:16,999
And we found that it's a topic that really resonates with teens because it's something that a lot of them are going through.

344
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:21,723
So we wanted to do a quest to the dressless and we wanted to do it in a realistic way

345
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:27,467
that both helped teens and also felt genuine and not necessarily just like a public service announcement.

346
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,690
So we introduced this character that you see on the screen. Her name is Hope.

347
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,292
And she is Julian's little sister in the game.

348
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,881
And the way that we wanted to introduce the topic, we didn't want to just have her coming

349
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:41,142
to you for help because you don't know her, that wouldn't necessarily be very realistic.

350
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:44,063
So we had it be that Julian comes to you for help.

351
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:48,464
He's noticed that Hope is withdrawn and she's seeming depressed at school.

352
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,825
And as a concerned older brother, he wants to get your help.

353
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:55,426
So he comes to you and you take Hope out bowling, you buy her a milkshake, you try to get to

354
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:55,706
know her.

355
00:20:55,706 --> 00:21:00,487
And through the course of getting to know her, you see her as she like gets a text and

356
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:01,907
you see her face fall as she's...

357
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,748
Notice that something mean that someone sent to her.

358
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:07,223
and you kind of get her to open up through the course of that.

359
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,624
And once she starts talking to you, you find out people are sending her really mean messages,

360
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:14,406
and she thinks she can handle it on her own. She doesn't want to make a big deal out of it.

361
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,268
She doesn't want to go to her parents or the authorities because she thinks that they'll

362
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:22,410
over-dramatize the whole situation, and she thinks she should be able to handle it.

363
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,412
And of course, you as a good friend, you know, you're not necessarily a responsible adult in

364
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:31,034
this situation. You try to go along with her wishes, and you try to help her just by confronting

365
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,575
the bullies directly. You try to help her ignore it.

366
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:37,237
And all of it kind of comes to a head and ends up blowing up in your face, and you realize

367
00:21:37,237 --> 00:21:39,379
that you do need to get some bigger help from this.

368
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:44,523
And so we partnered with a real cyberbullying charity for this, the CyberSmile Foundation.

369
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:50,467
And they both have resources for teens, and they also have an outreach program where teens

370
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,329
can contact them and get help.

371
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:59,174
And so by working with them, we were able to craft a real scenario in the game that

372
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:01,956
actually showed teens the steps to take when you are being cyberbullied.

373
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,837
and how we can help them in a realistic way.

374
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,759
So a few quick facts about it.

375
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,721
Over two million players have finished this quest,

376
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:13,404
and over 100 players reach out to CyberSmile

377
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:15,526
every week through our game.

378
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:18,108
So that's teams who wouldn't necessarily

379
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:21,310
have found CyberSmile without our game

380
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,152
as kind of a gateway to get them there.

381
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:24,333
And we've also donated over $200,000 to CyberSmile.

382
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,475
All right, so story and gameplay.

383
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:29,156
Any game can have romance,

384
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,998
is a famous quote by Will McGrath.

385
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:34,283
This is something he likes to say all the time during our brainstorms.

386
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:40,268
Sometimes we talk about it more theoretically, and particularly in preparing for GDC, you're

387
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:44,732
saying any game can have romance in it, not just a game like ours about high school.

388
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:49,336
So for example, in Where's My Water, the alligator wants to get clean, but he wants to get clean

389
00:22:49,336 --> 00:22:53,580
because he's going on a date, and that gives him that little extra romantic push, like

390
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,520
an extra motivation.

391
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,863
Another example that we talk about in the office is...

392
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:04,089
If you were to challenge us to put a romantic angle on Flappy Bird, we might say,

393
00:23:04,089 --> 00:23:08,752
he is trying to make it through this obstacle course of pipes because there is a ladybird

394
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:12,374
on the other side that he is trying to get to, and this is true love.

395
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:16,717
But in our case, we are pretty lucky because we integrated this dating mechanic,

396
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:18,598
so we don't have to stretch for it. It's right there.

397
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:22,180
In our game, you can send any two people in your school on a date.

398
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,282
You just pick one from each column.

399
00:23:24,282 --> 00:23:25,943
And I have an example of a date.

400
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,893
here where I've sent Peyton and Julian on a date together.

401
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:32,935
And every time you collect on a date, well every time you send people on a date, it takes

402
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:33,655
a certain amount of time.

403
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:37,196
And you can rush through the date or you can let it play out.

404
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:40,338
And then you get a little story that goes along with it.

405
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,038
So here's an example.

406
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:18,851
So in our game you can play matchmaker.

407
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:23,713
Dates can be good, bad, or you can also salvage a bad date.

408
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,514
So let's say you spilled soup all over your date and that person is very upset.

409
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:30,595
Maybe you buy them some flowers and everything ends up being okay.

410
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:34,527
You can also level up relationships with enough good dates.

411
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:37,789
So, you know, you can go from crushing to flirting to online official.

412
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:39,290
And you can also break up couples.

413
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,372
So we've seen a lot of player response to this dating mechanic

414
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:46,734
and this putting romance in the game this way.

415
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:50,116
Some examples are this one which was posted on Tumblr.

416
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,077
It's someone saying,

417
00:24:51,077 --> 00:24:52,818
there was a quest where I had to break up a couple.

418
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:53,998
It was not an easy choice.

419
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:56,120
It was like watching my own kid go through their first breakup.

420
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,772
Another example is people like to share

421
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:01,574
the relationships that they put together,

422
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,275
especially when they reach these new dating levels.

423
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,896
So this couple is now crushing,

424
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:07,018
and this person chose to share it

425
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:09,259
and said, my babies, as the caption.

426
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,342
So the kind of takeaway from that is

427
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:14,964
people like to see romance.

428
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:17,105
When they get to interact with it in the game,

429
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:19,127
they want to share, they want to talk about it,

430
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:20,748
and they want to come back and see how it's going.

431
00:25:20,748 --> 00:25:23,470
So some more player reactions.

432
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,672
People saying they're too emotionally attached

433
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:26,553
to High School Story.

434
00:25:26,912 --> 00:25:31,374
I barely downloaded it today and High School Story is becoming my life, but I honestly have no problem with that.

435
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:34,955
And so on. So we feel like it's working pretty well.

436
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:39,056
Alright, next I'm going to talk

437
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:43,058
about interactive choices in our game. So we have all of these different mechanics

438
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:46,999
at work, but we also have choices to make sure that the narrative is really drawing players in

439
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:50,900
and making them feel engaged. So we have two types of choices in our game. One is

440
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,822
story choices and another is pass fail choices. So in a story choice

441
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,802
this is just how you want to interact with the game.

442
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,682
Here's an example. You're playing truth or dare. Do you want to pick truth, dare, or just making out?

443
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:05,403
There's no right or wrong answer here.

444
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:10,705
It's really just how you want to play in the high school world, how you want to experience the scene, and how you want

445
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:11,125
to see it play out.

446
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:16,267
This is more of a test type minigame. This is pass-fail.

447
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:20,409
It kind of is checking how well you've been paying attention to the scene, and it's also checking, you know,

448
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:26,351
how quickly you can read and react to this. So in this case, you're running across a muddy field. Do you keep your balance?

449
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,773
or do you freeze and fall?

450
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:31,214
And each of these have a story-based reward.

451
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,554
So if you keep your balance, you win the race

452
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:34,835
and everyone's very impressed.

453
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,456
But if you freeze and fall, you're in the mud.

454
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:38,176
Everyone's laughing at you.

455
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:41,637
And we want to make sure in all of our writing

456
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:43,838
that we give our choices consequences.

457
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:45,438
So not only do we have the story,

458
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,219
you know, the scene plays out how you want it to play out

459
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,300
or you see the reaction, but we also

460
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,880
have hidden flags that our players don't necessarily

461
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,561
know about.

462
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,881
And we use those to track different variables

463
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:55,362
in the game.

464
00:26:55,842 --> 00:26:59,984
So, for instance, Royal showed you at the beginning that you can choose to be a jock,

465
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:00,544
a nerd, or a prep.

466
00:27:00,544 --> 00:27:04,646
And we track that choice in the game and we call back to that in dialogue.

467
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:08,827
So if you've chosen to play a jock, if someone asks you later if you like football, you might

468
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,108
be like, of course, I'm a jock.

469
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:14,570
Or if you're a nerd, you might say things that are more academic focused, and so on.

470
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,271
Another example is the band choice.

471
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,252
So I mentioned earlier that I have a band in the game.

472
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:22,873
And you get the choice of what instrument you want to play.

473
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,934
So you can pick guitar, vocals, or fiddle.

474
00:27:25,372 --> 00:27:29,636
And then whenever your band plays, you'll get a call back to that, either in a scene or a mini-game,

475
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:33,760
where maybe you have to match the lyrics of the song you're singing, or hit the right notes,

476
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,482
and then that'll determine whether your band plays well or poorly.

477
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:43,048
And then the last example I have about this is something we do on the back end of the game,

478
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:46,732
that again, most players aren't aware of this, but in the very first choice that you make,

479
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,535
you can pick whether you are a male or female character.

480
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,642
And if you choose to be a guy, in the very first confrontation, you'll be matched up against Max,

481
00:27:55,642 --> 00:27:58,705
who is an antagonist from the rival high school, Hearst High.

482
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:03,910
And he and the head cheerleader there are both kind of an antagonistic duo,

483
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,994
but in this case, if you're playing as a guy, you'll see him in the first confrontation,

484
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:11,597
and your choices will be about how to deal with him as he tries to bully you.

485
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:15,802
If you're playing as a girl, then you'll square off against the head cheerleader.

486
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:21,074
And this is one of the small tweaks that we make to the game, just to give it context,

487
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:26,577
because if you're a female player and a male character comes up and tries to punch you,

488
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:28,819
that has a very different connotation than if you're two guys fighting.

489
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:33,441
So this is, again, just something we do to try and make the world feel real and immersive and

490
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:39,445
tailored to the player. So you might notice that in either path, your last choice there

491
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:43,007
is that you can flirt with the bully that is antagonizing you.

492
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,531
And we've noticed that this is something that is really popular in our game,

493
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:50,454
especially when we see people playing through YouTube videos of,

494
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:53,296
like, they'll do a playthrough and show themselves progressing through the tutorial.

495
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,659
And usually they're pretty straightforward about everything until they get to this choice,

496
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,822
which is the point where they laugh out loud and stop for a moment

497
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:02,784
because they don't expect a game like ours to make a joke like this

498
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:05,606
and not take itself too seriously.

499
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:08,769
So that brings me to my last point of comedy and fun.

500
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:12,592
So we found it's very important to try to delight and impress the players.

501
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:16,388
And whether that's through being silly, clever, or surprising,

502
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,971
you just want to do something that kind of sets the story apart.

503
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:23,033
So I have some examples of our most shared moments

504
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:25,175
on Tumblr and Facebook and Twitter,

505
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:28,698
and I'll just walk through those and kind of why we think that they are funny.

506
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,660
So this is a post from Tumblr,

507
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,583
and this is a character in the game talking about Tumblr.

508
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,565
This line was written by Royal.

509
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:38,946
That's a Royal McGraw original.

510
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:44,677
And it's about talking about how this character has been posted about on Tumblr,

511
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:46,598
which is something we see our players doing.

512
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:51,160
And she is using all the Tumblr terminology that we could fit into one line of dialogue.

513
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,461
And the caption of this is, Why I love High School Story.

514
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:58,163
So in this case, we feel like the players feel like we get them.

515
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,664
We understand what they are doing. We understand how they talk.

516
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:04,805
Another example of something that has been posted is this item description of a potted plant.

517
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:12,147
Not necessarily a place where you expect to see a joke,

518
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:14,448
but because we try to pack humor in everywhere

519
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:17,630
and make it just feel like a cohesively fun world,

520
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,511
this player chose to post about it.

521
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:21,993
And lastly, I have an example of a date in the game.

522
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:23,955
So in this date, which is one of the ones

523
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,536
we see most posted about,

524
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,117
Peter and Kalaya, this is a real fan posted this example.

525
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,679
So Peter and Kalaya stayed up all night

526
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:30,699
playing High School Story,

527
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:32,921
and they named two characters after themselves

528
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:34,001
and sent them on a date.

529
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:38,874
And then they had an amazing time together in the game and in real life.

530
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:39,175
It's so meta.

531
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:44,278
And players like this one because they're, again, not expecting us to take the step,

532
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,619
I guess, of being a little bit silly.

533
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:49,281
And as one player put it, my game just murdered the fourth wall.

534
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:53,464
And all of the posts about it are kind of along this line of they're surprised,

535
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:58,307
they're delighted, and they really appreciate that we're trying to, you know,

536
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:01,348
make the game a little bit more clever than it needed to be.

537
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:07,586
All right, so all this romance, all this drama, all this comedy,

538
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:11,369
so on the one hand, it's just like giving players a very enjoyable experience,

539
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,011
but on the other hand, it directly impacts the bottom line.

540
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,393
All right, so most apps we're seeing,

541
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:22,235
I'm just going to take an aside to marketing,

542
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:27,959
most apps we're seeing when they're trying to grab non-incentivized installs,

543
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,760
they're paying.

544
00:31:30,193 --> 00:31:33,235
for about two for every one organic install that they receive.

545
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:39,700
Because we've been able to tap into our player base and get them posting on Tumblr, get them

546
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,084
posting on Twitter, sharing on Facebook, because they're talking, because they're having a

547
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:46,906
good time, they're having something that's emotional, they're sharing it.

548
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,588
So we launched on August 1st.

549
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:54,532
We're still seeing a paid-to-organic ratio of one to three.

550
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:59,415
That means we're purchasing one install for every three that we're getting organically.

551
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:04,699
Another benefit, this was something that was sort of unexpected.

552
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:09,964
When we put together our writing team, we knew that we wanted a big narrative game.

553
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:16,369
But what we didn't expect was that we were going to end up with a pretty savvy marketing unit as well.

554
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:22,073
Because we're generating all these quests every week, you know, in October we're thinking about Christmas.

555
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,915
We're thinking about ways to hook the player.

556
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,994
for events that are happening far in the future.

557
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:30,015
And that basically works out to marketing as well.

558
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:33,176
So we're generating all of our marketing copy in-house.

559
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:36,397
I've heard a lot of talk at GDC.

560
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:40,158
I've seen numbers on the internet.

561
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:44,319
It seems to be about $2.50 for a non-incentivized install

562
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,080
these days on mobile.

563
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,221
We're still averaging under $1.25.

564
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:49,741
All right.

565
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:53,122
So the final point on stories.

566
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:58,310
is cliffhangers. Let me see if we've got Wes dressed up like Indiana Jones.

567
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,992
But this is, you know, it's a joke but it's also really true.

568
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:06,435
Cliffhangers really are one of the most important tactics for ensuring that our

569
00:33:06,435 --> 00:33:06,875
players return.

570
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,037
The first one, the first aspect of it is just

571
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:14,600
functional. We release two to three new quests

572
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,923
every week, but even with that some of our players are at the bleeding edge of

573
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:20,664
the content that we deliver.

574
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:20,844
So...

575
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:28,255
when they finish their weekly quest drop, there literally is nothing else for them to play quest-wise in the game.

576
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:34,837
That means it needs to be exciting, it has to have some sort of emotional hook, some sort of narrative surprise,

577
00:33:34,837 --> 00:33:38,998
something that gets them to say, you know, in seven days, I want to come back.

578
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:44,359
The second aspect is, you know, our bread and butter.

579
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:48,360
We need each of our links in our quest chain to be exciting.

580
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:52,727
to have something that's compelling, something that's driving it forward so that players

581
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:59,772
will either choose to rush through that, eliminate the timer with a premium purchase, or they'll

582
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:05,656
come back when the timer ends. So, here's an example. We had a quest chain with a mysterious

583
00:34:05,656 --> 00:34:12,440
figure named Pandora. She was sort of blackmailing your classmates. She was making them do things

584
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,563
like jump in a fountain or embarrass themselves in other ways. This was a big, long quest

585
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,824
chain that lasted about a month.

586
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,602
our players were really eager to figure out who Pandora is.

587
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,084
They really, really wanted to know.

588
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:26,585
So Wes, one of your friends, he runs up and is like,

589
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,907
guys, I know who Pandora is.

590
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:30,788
You tap through and of course, you know,

591
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:32,149
you hit your 24-hour wait wall.

592
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:35,051
And of course, you know, some of our players

593
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:38,734
are gonna come back the next day and we really like that.

594
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:41,396
Some of our players are gonna choose to rush through.

595
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,937
So the question is, how many of our players

596
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:47,240
are choosing to rush through based on these cliffhangers?

597
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:47,460
Well.

598
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:51,618
83% of all of our users have rushed at some point.

599
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:56,819
The caveat is that we're pretty liberal with our premium currency in the early game, but

600
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:01,580
still, I mean, they're choosing to rush through, to go from story to more story, rather than

601
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,361
spending their rings on premium decorations or premium outfits or any of the other things

602
00:35:06,361 --> 00:35:07,982
that they could choose to purchase.

603
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:13,623
So for cliffhangers, if you're going to implement them, these are the things that sort of you

604
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:14,403
want to focus on.

605
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,783
The first is positive worry.

606
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:18,194
You love your grandmother if she's sick.

607
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:19,315
You want her to get better.

608
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:21,598
The same is true of classmates in the school.

609
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:24,101
If they care about them, if they're in a tight spot,

610
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:27,385
the players will want to see them out of that spot.

611
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:28,126
Need to know.

612
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,308
The Pandora Quest is a good example of that.

613
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:33,712
If you have a mystery, if you have some puzzle that will be solved,

614
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:35,635
fans are eager to move forward through that.

615
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:38,389
And then the last one is just delayed gratification.

616
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:40,090
Everybody has a favorite TV show.

617
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,231
There's a big explosive season finale.

618
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:45,113
You're wondering, OK, what's going to happen next?

619
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:47,634
How are they going to get out of this spot?

620
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,175
Are they going to make it?

621
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:51,216
Well, you're going to have to come back in the fall when the

622
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,018
show starts back up again.

623
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:56,440
So earlier I talked about story gating story.

624
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,041
And I want to get back to that.

625
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,462
The first aspect of that is just simply.

626
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:03,719
when you complete a quest, you're rewarded with a new quest.

627
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:06,900
Fans are very eager for this. They want more story.

628
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,961
It really hooks them. But once you know

629
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:15,962
fans are really eager for story, once you have them hooked in this sort of

630
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:16,683
narrative world,

631
00:36:16,683 --> 00:36:19,343
then at that point, you know, it's not a big step to say,

632
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,824
okay, maybe we'll offer some premium storylines. Maybe we'll

633
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:26,425
offer some quests that they'll have to pay for.

634
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:29,386
So we've done that, and our premium quest chains offer.

635
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:32,759
First off, more time with characters you like.

636
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:34,799
Say for instance, Autumn, she's the first character

637
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:35,680
you meet at the school.

638
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,541
She's sort of in the game world, your best friend.

639
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,041
We had a Quest Harvest Festival.

640
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,302
You got to see where she spent her summers as a kid

641
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,283
and just spend more time bonding with her.

642
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:48,183
We offer unique emotional experiences

643
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:50,464
over the Christmas break.

644
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:52,265
We had a quest where you could choose

645
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:55,346
who you were gonna spend time with under the mistletoe.

646
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,586
That was a lot of fun.

647
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:57,686
And we also,

648
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:04,868
offer opportunities to do something fun that's a little bit elevated from the traditional

649
00:37:04,868 --> 00:37:07,390
high school context.

650
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,332
So you could fly to Paris to view a runway fashion show.

651
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:14,354
You could go to Los Angeles to see a red carpet premiere.

652
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:15,894
So this is Haunted Hearts.

653
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:18,916
It was a premium quest we released during Halloween.

654
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,557
You can see that it cost 100 rings.

655
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:26,560
Now, the four gas lamps it requires are also premium decorations.

656
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,901
They cost 25 rings apiece.

657
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:33,638
So that's 200 rings total, which works out to about $1.40 in real U.S. currency.

658
00:37:33,638 --> 00:37:39,680
Alright, so how many of our players are actually buying these premium quests?

659
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,183
Well, 63% of our players have purchased a premium quest at some point.

660
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:49,265
Again, same caveats, we're pretty generous with our premium currency.

661
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:53,166
But here's the real number, that's pretty great.

662
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,644
During the initial week of launch, 25% of all of our active users purchased Haunted Hearts.

663
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:05,106
All right, so I'm going to recap a bit and then we're going to get to sort of what this

664
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:06,507
gets you with retention.

665
00:38:06,507 --> 00:38:10,450
So good game writing, as Kara mentioned.

666
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,310
It's memorable characters.

667
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:17,174
We recommend for mobile to start broad, start with stereotypes and then deepen them over

668
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:20,996
time after they've found their footing, after the players have found their footing.

669
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,944
Romance and drama, you really cannot have too much romance.

670
00:38:25,944 --> 00:38:29,267
Choices and consequences, every choice a player makes

671
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,688
makes the experience theirs.

672
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:34,852
The more theirs it is, the more likely they are to come back.

673
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:38,535
Comedy and fun, if you can give a player something

674
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:40,997
that delights them, something that surprises them,

675
00:38:40,997 --> 00:38:42,578
they're gonna share it.

676
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:43,539
And that's so huge.

677
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:46,462
And then cliffhangers, if you can figure out a way

678
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:49,785
to make them come back narratively, that's so, so powerful.

679
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,661
If you can do all these things, story becomes its own reward.

680
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:57,304
They'll move through the quest, and what they'll want is another quest,

681
00:38:57,304 --> 00:38:59,586
and they'll keep coming back and keep coming back.

682
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,207
Good game writing is not overlong.

683
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:05,710
If you're starting off with a five-minute history of your world,

684
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:11,153
maybe you shouldn't. Maybe you should get something funny, something heartfelt,

685
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:16,157
and then if you really have to after a player is hooked, that's the time for the history lesson.

686
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:19,299
It's not present for its own sake. Everything should be tethered.

687
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:23,049
Are we tethered dating? Figure out a way to make your storyline

688
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:26,272
integrate seamlessly. It's not self-indulgent.

689
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:29,614
In an ideal world, your interests would align with your players' interests

690
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:34,399
a hundred percent of the time. That's just not true. So write for your players. Always

691
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:35,960
remember who your players are and

692
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,705
see if you can tap into the things that they know. And good game writing is not

693
00:39:41,705 --> 00:39:45,948
lacking in delight or surprise. If a player is surprised, they're gonna talk.

694
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,410
Just gonna talk.

695
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,864
So very good retention in a mobile game these days.

696
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:55,046
There's a variety of numbers, but what we've seen

697
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:57,909
and what we're sort of basing our claims on

698
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:02,212
is this idea of one day, 60%.

699
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:05,475
After one week, 40%.

700
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:06,556
After one month, 10%.

701
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:09,919
I've heard some talk at GDC about some apps

702
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:12,701
that are averaging 20 or 30% one day retention.

703
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,863
Well, where are we with High School Story?

704
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:21,993
For High School Story, we've seen one day retention of 71%.

705
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:24,794
After a week, we've still got over half of all of our users.

706
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:27,655
And after a month, we've still got a third.

707
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:31,297
Just so you can sort of visualize this.

708
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:34,198
This is the difference we're talking about.

709
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,399
All right, so hopefully, as a takeaway,

710
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:42,621
we've convinced you that Story can be

711
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:45,122
a really powerful tool to aid retention.

712
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:49,495
We definitely recommend that you add story if you can.

713
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:52,215
We recommend you add it judiciously.

714
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:56,036
We think you should integrate story early with writers.

715
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,137
Writers are really good at shaping emotional experience.

716
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:02,298
And if you can shape that emotional experience,

717
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:04,018
your players will be drawn in.

718
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:08,499
And then, finally, don't be afraid to revise or cut.

719
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,360
Cutting is so important.

720
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:19,242
That's about it. We want to thank you guys for showing up on Friday.

721
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:20,102
We really appreciate it.

722
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,042
And we'll take questions.

723
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:36,785
Applause

724
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,785
Hello, my name is Martin.

725
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:42,126
This is a narrative story with a lot of reading.

726
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:48,147
And gamers say, well, nobody reads, which, of course, is not true.

727
00:41:48,147 --> 00:41:53,870
But I wonder if you can think of any examples of games that have used story very, very well

728
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:59,854
without all the reading and conveying it visually.

729
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:07,598
The question was, are there any games that have used story very well that do not have

730
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:08,359
all this reading?

731
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,100
Do you want to take this?

732
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:15,791
I'll think about it. Right off the bat, I'd point to Brothers.

733
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:18,713
Did a remarkable job of character work without any

734
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:22,056
dialogue that was either spoken or written on screen.

735
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:28,801
Yeah, that was good.

736
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:30,563
Would you like any more?

737
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:32,024
Is that good for you? Next question.

738
00:42:32,024 --> 00:42:38,929
You had talked briefly about players kind of spamming through some of those

739
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:44,923
repetitive pop-ups with the narrative being delivered.

740
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:48,183
It's kind of a two-fold question.

741
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:53,625
Do you think there's anything particularly special that you

742
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:57,186
guys are doing to really engage people at that time?

743
00:42:57,186 --> 00:43:00,326
And do you have any metrics that are actually testing

744
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:02,307
whether or not people are spamming through them or

745
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:04,607
actually staying around to read them?

746
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:07,188
We don't actually have any metrics on whether or not

747
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:08,728
players are spamming through.

748
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:14,157
I can tell you that we keep our dialogues a little shorter at the beginning of the game

749
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:18,861
and then gradually ramp up the duration of them, so they get longer as the game goes on.

750
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:23,626
Right, if you play through the tutorial of our game, there's not too much dialogue to spam through.

751
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:27,229
So, hopefully just keeping it short enough lets people play.

752
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,132
So, we ease them into the length of the narrative.

753
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:34,256
I also think putting in choices is another way of breaking up things for people who are spamming,

754
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,897
because if they get to a choice point...

755
00:43:36,275 --> 00:43:41,676
then they might realize, like, oh, I should've been paying attention because now someone's asking me, you know, like,

756
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:47,058
what the combination to the safe is or something, and I need to know that to get my coin reward.

757
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,358
Next question.

758
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:55,300
Hi, so your system is very, like, open for addition and stuff with how you're adding quests every week.

759
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,241
Is there anything you can say about, like, the process of coming up with this system

760
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:03,483
that was very easy to add more story and stuff without, like, messing with the world in a sense?

761
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:08,986
Yeah, okay, so the question is how do we keep adding more to the story without breaking it?

762
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:13,488
I think from the beginning we knew this was going to be an ongoing narrative,

763
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:18,329
so we tried to brainstorm everything from the characters that we were using to the type of story that we were telling

764
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:20,110
around kind of these big narrative chunks.

765
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,771
So there's two kinds of quests in the app.

766
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:25,432
There's the main storyline.

767
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:29,213
So there's a main storyline where you're kind of pitted up against Hearst High,

768
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:32,935
and when that's over there's another storyline that Royal touched on, which is the Pandora arc.

769
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,971
And then in between playing those, you also get the seasonal quests and the other types of content.

770
00:44:37,971 --> 00:44:44,473
So I think part of it is having a big plan when you start, so that you know the bold strokes of where you're going.

771
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:50,074
And then that way, all the other quests that are coming in, you know not to step on, like when it's not to step on,

772
00:44:50,074 --> 00:44:55,655
you can say, well, Julian's going to be having some trouble, so you should not talk about Julian in this other quest until much later.

773
00:44:59,069 --> 00:45:03,671
Do you have a lot of revisions based on the user feedback?

774
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:06,252
Do you monitor how they react to the story?

775
00:45:06,252 --> 00:45:09,033
Do you have to rewrite based on how they like it?

776
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:11,855
The question is, do we react to feedback from our fans?

777
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:15,456
Yeah, we definitely react to feedback from our fans.

778
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:19,358
We're very curious on the writing team,

779
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,399
so we like to follow our Twitter account and our forum

780
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:24,880
and see how people are reacting.

781
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,382
had times where people have said, you know, like,

782
00:45:27,382 --> 00:45:29,603
well, this character seems like they're good at everything.

783
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:31,304
And we're like, oh, we're going to make her really bad

784
00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:33,084
at something next, things like that.

785
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:34,485
So we definitely pay attention.

786
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:36,606
In terms of revising things that are already out,

787
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:39,467
we'll definitely tweak things if people mention something

788
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:41,547
that we feel really hits home.

789
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:43,488
For the most part, though, our internal revision,

790
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:45,349
I think catches most of the things

791
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:48,350
because it's just such a rigorous process of review

792
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,630
and peer review that we end up getting a lot

793
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,611
of our editing in that way.

794
00:45:55,335 --> 00:46:01,059
Do all players essentially get the same narrative experience, or is there opportunities where

795
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:05,381
someone can branch in one direction and close off a bunch of quests that they can never do?

796
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:13,166
The question is about if choices make you so that things branch off and block off different

797
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:19,450
pathways. I'd say for the most part we try not to limit players because we don't want people to

798
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,272
feel frustrated with this game, and because there's no real way to replay it without starting over

799
00:46:23,272 --> 00:46:24,293
from the very beginning.

800
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:28,351
We're not expecting anyone to do that, especially since it's ongoing.

801
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,832
So we wouldn't want players to feel like,

802
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:31,793
oh, you know, because I did this, I didn't realize,

803
00:46:31,793 --> 00:46:34,315
I totally missed out on forming my own band or something like that.

804
00:46:34,315 --> 00:46:37,317
So for the most part, we try to let players play everything,

805
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:40,419
but it definitely is customized to the choices that you've made,

806
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:41,159
if that makes sense.

807
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:43,761
Yeah, the one exception to that would be seasonal quests,

808
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,943
which if they don't access them in a timely fashion,

809
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:47,923
they'll just never see them.

810
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:51,225
So some players will see content that other players do not.

811
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:56,907
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the relationship between the writers

812
00:46:56,907 --> 00:47:02,571
and maybe the monetization team or the LiveOps team and how those things, how these two kind

813
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:09,355
of parallel paths that in the end have to result in monetization, how do writers, how

814
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:16,139
do you deal with that tension between the writers and LiveOps or monetization team?

815
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:20,302
So the question is how do we reconcile the differences between what the monetization

816
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:20,382
team...

817
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:24,858
does and what the writing team does.

818
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:25,179
The...

819
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,440
Our CEO likes to joke that

820
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,021
we have zero monetization

821
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,042
experts, and that's

822
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:33,022
basically true

823
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:35,343
other than him and one of our writers.

824
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:36,804
The writing team all wears

825
00:47:36,804 --> 00:47:39,485
multiple hats, so

826
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:40,866
you know, one of

827
00:47:40,866 --> 00:47:42,727
our writers is doing work

828
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:44,487
on the monetization, so it's not...

829
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,988
there's no butting heads on it. We're all sort of

830
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:48,229
moving in the same direction.

831
00:47:48,568 --> 00:47:56,493
Because we have so many writers in-house, it's a lot more of everyone's kind of looking at the numbers and understanding how everything is happening.

832
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:59,394
So there's not that much, I guess, tension.

833
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:01,836
Because there's so much visibility, so people understand.

834
00:48:01,836 --> 00:48:08,799
We have to do it this way, and they're like, okay, we'll come up with a really good narrative that works for that.

835
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:13,862
Can you tell us about the statistics of the users?

836
00:48:14,263 --> 00:48:15,844
teens, older?

837
00:48:15,844 --> 00:48:17,506
Okay, I can speak to that.

838
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:25,532
So the short answer is that because of the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act, we

839
00:48:25,532 --> 00:48:28,375
do not track anything internally.

840
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:34,400
Our best metrics come from Facebook, because users have to be over 13 to sign in for that.

841
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,021
So we can see that data.

842
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:43,147
Because of that, we have some limited amount of data from our ad partners.

843
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:52,439
Our principal demographic is 13 to 22, so high school and college students.

844
00:48:52,439 --> 00:49:01,824
That may be a little off, just again because we cannot track younger players.

845
00:49:01,824 --> 00:49:05,046
Was that helpful?

846
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:08,388
I would say we definitely skew heavily female.

847
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:11,668
You might have caught that from the Twitter post.

848
00:49:11,668 --> 00:49:16,490
We can talk more about that a little later if you'd like.

849
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,932
It seems like you're adding a lot of story and a lot of

850
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,593
quests pretty frequently.

851
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:24,154
And I saw up there there's eight writers and 16 people

852
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:25,275
total in the studio.

853
00:49:25,275 --> 00:49:29,737
What kind of tools have you guys built so that once

854
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:33,639
someone writes a quest, it's actually not that much

855
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:36,241
engineering effort, I hope, to actually publish it into

856
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:36,861
something that's?

857
00:49:37,438 --> 00:49:41,759
a user would see because it looks like there's a lot of emotional reaction to what the character is saying.

858
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:45,580
There's a lot of stuff that seems to happen in the background. So can you just talk a little bit

859
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,241
about the tools you've developed and the workflow that you have to publish that number of quests?

860
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:53,001
Yeah, so our workflow is we have really great tools set up by our developers. So the writers

861
00:49:53,001 --> 00:50:02,243
are actually able to take it from, you know, story all the way to playable ourselves. And well,

862
00:50:02,243 --> 00:50:04,663
we have the help of an intern who's really great.

863
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,472
at messing around with some files for us.

864
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:11,255
But we don't need any development help to do it.

865
00:50:11,255 --> 00:50:13,836
And so that's one of the best tools

866
00:50:13,836 --> 00:50:18,459
is that we're able to just play it immediately and see

867
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:19,220
how it plays in the game.

868
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,162
We're able to try it out and be like, oh, well,

869
00:50:22,162 --> 00:50:24,103
this weight feels really long or something like that.

870
00:50:24,103 --> 00:50:27,065
As evidenced by your cyberbullying quest,

871
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:31,508
it seems that you have a really good soapbox available to you.

872
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:33,650
How do you decide when to engage with issues?

873
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:40,814
That has a lot to do with Oliver, our CEO, but I think we're really big on using our

874
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:43,275
platform to try and do some good in the world.

875
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:46,996
Yeah, and we're definitely looking at other topics to cover, so I think we're always kind

876
00:50:46,996 --> 00:50:48,296
of on the lookout for it.

877
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:54,078
The thing we just want to be most careful about is always doing it in a way that feels

878
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:59,240
very genuine to players and never coming off as too preachy or like we're throwing too

879
00:50:59,240 --> 00:50:59,800
much at them.

880
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,321
You know, definitely since we had such a good response to people.

881
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,349
from our CyberSmile campaign that we did.

882
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:09,651
I think we're definitely working on, like right now,

883
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,353
trying to figure out our next step on that.

884
00:51:12,353 --> 00:51:15,356
Okay. Oh, that's really far away.

885
00:51:15,356 --> 00:51:20,340
So, a high school story seems pretty specific to a lot

886
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,223
of North American high school in terms of narrative.

887
00:51:24,223 --> 00:51:26,585
Is that, do you find that that's limiting in terms

888
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:29,747
of your audience, that it skews very American, or do you?

889
00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:38,521
try to write it in a neutral way so that it's a little more accessible to Europeans and other people.

890
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:45,646
So the question is, is high school accessible to areas outside of North America?

891
00:51:45,646 --> 00:51:51,169
So, we have chosen, because we have so much story content,

892
00:51:51,169 --> 00:51:53,831
obviously we have not localized to other regions,

893
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:57,593
so that would limit our accessibility right off the bat.

894
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:05,092
That being said, we've done very well in the United Kingdom, so clearly we can go across the pond.

895
00:52:05,092 --> 00:52:13,197
I think if we were trying to transition more fully to Asian markets, China, Japan,

896
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:19,801
we would have additional concerns in terms of art style that we would want to address as well before we went big there.

897
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:27,426
Connected to that question is...

898
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,063
the idea that North America, of course, has people from many, many countries.

899
00:52:33,063 --> 00:52:36,066
And you have a lot of ethnic diversity here.

900
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:40,850
And how much do you make an effort to reflect that in your storytelling?

901
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,093
And then on a connected note, how often do you get players

902
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:47,796
who actually do flirt with the bully of the same gender?

903
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:52,159
Yeah, we've actually... the question is about diversity and

904
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,083
same-gender flirting. So one of the mechanics in the game is dating, and you can have, you know,

905
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:57,808
girls dating girls and guys dating guys.

906
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:00,390
And we've seen just an overwhelmingly positive response

907
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:03,893
on Tumblr and social medias about it.

908
00:53:03,893 --> 00:53:05,555
And also, just putting diversity in the cast

909
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:07,056
was something that was very important to us

910
00:53:07,056 --> 00:53:07,716
from the beginning.

911
00:53:07,716 --> 00:53:09,478
So, you know, you can see from the examples

912
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:12,120
that we've had up here, and also if you play the game,

913
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,421
the cast is very diverse.

914
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:15,503
Yeah, that was definitely a factor for us.

915
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:18,646
So I'm impressed by both the retention numbers

916
00:53:18,646 --> 00:53:21,568
you guys share, but also the virality numbers

917
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,690
in terms of organic installs you guys get.

918
00:53:24,115 --> 00:53:31,857
And I know from all the examples you've shown and what you guys mentioned just now that a lot of it is through social media channels player initiated.

919
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:41,820
How much do you guys do in terms of in-game sharing that makes that process easier? Or do you guys do any?

920
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,302
How much in-game sharing do we do?

921
00:53:47,302 --> 00:53:48,682
You can link to Facebook.

922
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:53,710
You can share, or Game Center, or Google Play if you're on Android.

923
00:53:53,710 --> 00:54:00,556
But I would say that is actually an area that we need to work on, making that process easier.

924
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:01,877
So it's exactly what you said.

925
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:03,558
It's really user-originated.

926
00:54:03,558 --> 00:54:03,918
Yeah.

927
00:54:03,918 --> 00:54:08,922
At the end of usually a quest, like, or a date, a screen will pop up, and if you're

928
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:12,726
logged in through Twitter or Facebook, it'll ask the player, like, do you want to share

929
00:54:12,726 --> 00:54:13,046
this?

930
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:16,989
And so we do see, you know, people using that button because it's right there next to, like,

931
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:17,029
OK.

932
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:21,074
So sometimes people will just share whatever we've prompted them to post.

933
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:21,354
Thanks.

934
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:26,396
All right, I think that's it for questions.

935
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:29,877
Thank you guys all so much for coming out and watching the talk.

936
00:54:29,877 --> 00:54:30,438
Thank you.
