1
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:11,847
So we're going to go ahead and get started now.

2
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:16,410
My name is Dave Mark.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,112
The thing is, though, I am going to represent,

4
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:24,634
for what it's worth, all of the AI devs in the world.

5
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:25,734
Kill me now.

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,656
And I don't have, hang on, oh, my slide's disappeared now.

7
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,218
Let me do this, restart that, and send it over,

8
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:34,139
and now it should show up.

9
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:43,142
because I am going to get bombarded with a wish list and hopefully no foul language from

10
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:49,746
my five panelists up here who have many things to say on this particular subject. So introducing

11
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:56,131
really quick, Noah Falstein on the left, Robin Hunnecke, Raph Koster, Laura McWilliams, and

12
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:58,913
I've heard your name before, right?

13
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,332
Richard Lemarchand.

14
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:00,913
Richard Lemarchand.

15
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:04,874
I wish, now it's Richard Lemarchand, isn't it?

16
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:08,955
He sounded a bit like one of those Ubisoft devs for a second.

17
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:09,615
Mais oui.

18
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:09,835
Yeah.

19
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:18,177
Anyway, back when we first started the summit, we did something in 2010 very similar to this,

20
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:23,398
where we asked designers via email a whole bunch of questions.

21
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,470
What limitations are you sick of hearing about?

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,011
What can film directors do with cast and crew

23
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,192
that you can only dream of with your AI characters?

24
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,413
Things like that.

25
00:01:33,413 --> 00:01:36,674
And then we actually had a panel up here

26
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:39,756
of some really, really nifty, out-of-the-box thinking

27
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:40,236
AI devs.

28
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,697
So it's kind of the reverse of this.

29
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:45,078
And so we iterated through those answers

30
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,219
that those designers gave us and kind of batted around,

31
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,721
well, how would we handle that?

32
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:50,521
Now, in.

33
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,584
to some extent or another, many of those issues have been solved.

34
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:56,426
Yes, it's in quotes.

35
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:59,769
Because we have advanced quite a bit in the past nine years or so

36
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:00,850
since we did this.

37
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,733
But apparently not well enough, or there's new issues.

38
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,737
Because in 2012, Warren Spector made waves amongst us AI folks

39
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:11,500
in a Eurogamer interview where he says,

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,763
I've been actively trying to shame my fellow developers,

41
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:16,785
specifically John Carmack and Tim Sweeney.

42
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:23,697
Can you imagine what games would look like if those two guys spent as much time working on non-combat AI as on rendering?

43
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:31,058
Can you imagine what they would look like if they wanted to create a believable character as opposed to a believable gun?

44
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:34,379
I mean, oh my god, these guys are way smarter than I. I don't know how to solve the problem,

45
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:42,421
but they could figure it out. Stop rendering, start creating humans or mice. I don't care which. Of course, he was working at Disney at the time.

46
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,281
So, but then...

47
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,505
I don't know what the state of mice AI is right now.

48
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:52,627
But he went on here at GDC, down the hall from us,

49
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,388
and I got wind of this later that day.

50
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:58,269
Warren was trashing on the AI summit

51
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,290
down at the narrative summit.

52
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,992
Where he says, we have to spend time on non-combat AI.

53
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,632
We figure out pathfinding and not

54
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,893
having characters fall into holes in the ground

55
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,394
and stuff like that.

56
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,774
How do we outflank the enemy?

57
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,635
We spend no time on going to the women's bathroom

58
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:14,976
and having people notice.

59
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:20,885
which is interestingly topical. People still come up to me and say, wow, that was so cool.

60
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:24,027
That was 13 years ago. Apparently it was something he had done in one of his prior games I was not

61
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:30,410
aware of. Have you seen a game where a drink was spilled and a character responded appropriately?

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,693
I think not. Have you seen a game where there was a spurned lover that mattered and it wasn't just

63
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:42,337
a movie masquerading as a game, like a cut scene? Have you ever seen a game where there was a would

64
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:44,018
be lover that you could interact with?

65
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,504
If anybody knows how to create a virtual game master,

66
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:52,128
putting me in a box or you in a box, I want to know.

67
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:54,250
Good stories are constructed, not found.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,351
Emergence can only get us so far.

69
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,793
And if we can dynamically modify stories

70
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:02,356
based on what players want to do, a good D&D campaign,

71
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:04,858
you want to screw around with the dungeon master.

72
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:06,159
And he actually responds.

73
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,003
So this is what he had said down the hall.

74
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:12,845
And we chatted later that week about this and a couple

75
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,126
of times since then.

76
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:15,572
Were you shamed?

77
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,555
Were you appropriately shamed by Warren?

78
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:23,960
Yeah, that I'm not John Carmack.

79
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,423
That's what you get for representing all AI devs

80
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,105
everywhere, I guess.

81
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:33,730
So anyway, Warren wanted to be on this panel desperately,

82
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,493
but this is apparently the first GDC he's going

83
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,955
to miss since the Civil War.

84
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:42,296
He's old.

85
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:45,400
He wanted me to let him watch this video.

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,906
Warren's one of my closest friends and mentors, so I'm just teasing him because he's not here.

87
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:54,509
But he did answer a number of questions that I posed to him through email.

88
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,190
We'll see those sprinkled through.

89
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,015
But we have a number of different topics that we have talked about over the past couple of weeks that we want to cover.

90
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:04,013
that subscribe to kind of their wish list.

91
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,154
And so we're just going to go through them in a topical order

92
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:08,754
and see who has what to say on these things.

93
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:11,235
We're not going to dive deep into technical solutions,

94
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:14,235
other than I may prod them, OK, wait a minute, hold on.

95
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,896
What would that look like?

96
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:17,396
What do you mean by that?

97
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:18,716
To get a little bit more information.

98
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:21,937
The goal of this is for us to sit here and go,

99
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:23,697
how would we solve that?

100
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,618
Because that would make our games better.

101
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,638
So the first topic I want to talk about is character AI.

102
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:38,442
Just which is normally what we do whether it be combat or non-combat and just have you folks throw out a couple of things

103
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,643
Just in general what would make?

104
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:48,667
Characters better that you're not seeing that you sit there and go off if we could only pull this off hit me. What do you got?

105
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:54,269
Well one of the things that I would love to see is recognition from characters that I am

106
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,771
Playing the game in a unique way. Yeah, so for example

107
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:04,730
I have a follower in Skyrim or in Fallout, and they comment on things in the world, and

108
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,552
they comment when we're attacked, but they comment in a general way.

109
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:10,894
They don't comment at all about what I do.

110
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:16,158
They don't comment on how I solve problems, on the fact that I had to take a healing potion,

111
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:21,401
on the fact that I tripped over something, or I got stuck on a rock, or changed weapons.

112
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:26,465
They don't seem to understand that I'm playing the game in a way that somebody else, you

113
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:28,026
know, is unique, versus somebody else.

114
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,908
And that's something that we can gather.

115
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:34,951
I mean, we know if we watch patterns of player behavior

116
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:37,373
when players are behaving differently

117
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,854
under certain circumstances.

118
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:40,355
And there's no reason that,

119
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,537
I mean, it's even as simple as recognizing

120
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:45,559
when I go to turn in a quest in a game like Destiny

121
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:49,181
that my group, or when I go to turn in after a strike,

122
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:51,943
that my fire team wiped three times,

123
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:53,464
but finished it anyway, right?

124
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:56,427
We know that because I literally just did it.

125
00:06:56,938 --> 00:07:01,499
there's no reason not to track it. I'm sure they're tracking it in metrics too, so if you have it from metrics,

126
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:06,821
why not have the game reflect that back to me and let me feel special, like the game recognizes me as a unique player?

127
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:12,162
Yeah, I think we focus, we over-focus on false plasticity with the character representation itself,

128
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:17,144
rather than actually looking at the data that we're constantly ignoring. I think it's really, it's really bad.

129
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:21,705
I mean, you can just even just track what, how often they press the controller and find out whether they're frustrated.

130
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,070
And Journey, a lot of the stuff that we did to edit down

131
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,771
the relationship between two people

132
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:27,773
involved paying attention to both people

133
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:29,954
and then sort of smoothing over their differences.

134
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,875
And a lot of people thought that the other character was an AI.

135
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,216
Like, if it had been an AI, it would then

136
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:35,797
have been the best fucking AI programming in the whole world,

137
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:36,338
you know?

138
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:40,260
Because it actually paid attention to you.

139
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,901
It was fake plastic, right?

140
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,362
We do a lot of fake plastic in games.

141
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,763
And that kind of plasticity would be really fantastic.

142
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,781
I have a little bit though actually around the fake plasticity because I think that I

143
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:55,643
don't think this is as important as what you've been discussing but I do see a lot of low

144
00:07:55,643 --> 00:08:02,307
hanging fruit around the way that NPCs, whether they are enemies or allies.

145
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:05,160
perform their kind of individual identities.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,301
And across the course of the Uncharted games,

147
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,702
you know, we did a little bit more each game around sort of,

148
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,123
I think a lot of it has to do with head tracking,

149
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:15,185
gaze tracking, whether people,

150
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:17,326
somebody gives somebody the side eye,

151
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,947
gait and the way that characters hold themselves

152
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:22,128
in idle animations and these kinds of things.

153
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:25,730
I think a lot of it has to do with the spatial distances

154
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,611
that sort of non-hostile NPCs in particular maintain

155
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,132
to the player character.

156
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:38,921
And the kind of surprise reactions that they do when the player character comes right up to them and gets in their face and how they jump back and how quickly they jump back.

157
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:47,287
I know some of this is sort of processing time related and we're able to get more and more prompt with sort of NPC reactions all the time.

158
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:52,331
I still think there's lots and lots of low hanging fruit right there.

159
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:58,737
So what I'm hearing is from you is a reactivity to just immediate stimulus.

160
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,213
Yes. Your recent past stimulus.

161
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:03,314
Mm-hmm. Play patterns, really.

162
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:08,957
So yeah, exactly. You know, I really loved the example when we were chatting about the way you play Fallout.

163
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,958
Yeah, so when I... Tell that, that's great.

164
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,300
So when I play Fallout, I have a pretty reliable pattern that I always play sniper.

165
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,302
So I stay sighted even when enemies are getting pretty close.

166
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:22,884
They have to get really up in my face before I'll switch to shotgun or something.

167
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:26,106
Except radscorpions, because they freak me out.

168
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:26,666
And so...

169
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,352
When a rad scorpion is approaching me, my play pattern radically changes.

170
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:37,497
I am shooting wildly, I'm fumbling, I'm backpedaling like a mad woman, and that's why I say tripping.

171
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:39,999
That NPCs should notice when I'm tripping because I'm constantly tripping over things

172
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,100
because I'm backpedaling.

173
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,382
I'll get up on rocks to try to avoid it.

174
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:47,185
I'll go unsighted much faster and switch to the shotgun much faster.

175
00:09:47,185 --> 00:09:50,547
If the game paid any attention at all, it would be totally clear that rad scorpions

176
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:50,967
freaked me out.

177
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:54,090
There's no reason that the NPC with me could not comment on that.

178
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,920
Or if you want to be terrible, if you're making a horror game,

179
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,240
that you couldn't take advantage of that.

180
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,682
Because now you know what in the game scares me the most.

181
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:01,823
And that's evil.

182
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:06,246
And when you mentioned this, Lauren,

183
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:09,028
there's something that I learned a couple of years ago

184
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:11,830
from the world of improv theater relating

185
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,592
to high and low status characters that

186
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:17,414
seem totally actionable in the world of AI

187
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,135
for characters in games.

188
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,878
It comes out of the work of Keith Johnston, who identified

189
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:23,418
that sort of.

190
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:32,099
People who perceive themselves as high status are more still, their gaze is a little higher.

191
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:37,301
People who perceive themselves as low status are sort of a bit more turned in on themselves,

192
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:43,242
their toes point in, they touch their face a lot and they act kind of quickly and more

193
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,963
nervously and I think we could do a lot of that quite easily.

194
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:55,592
But that's bullshit. That's total bullshit. That's like paying attention to how people actually are and then building systems that reflect how people actually are.

195
00:10:55,592 --> 00:11:04,399
And like the difference between AI that is plastic for real and AI that is fake plastic is paying attention to what real is.

196
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:12,266
Like get out of your head and the problem space of how do I respond in a relatively short time loop?

197
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:16,269
How do I get this animation cycle to work and have the foot planting be perfect?

198
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:22,034
that kind of paying attention is not paying attention to the level where it's really going

199
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:22,874
to make an emotional impact.

200
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:26,296
And you can actually fake a lot of that other stuff with art style.

201
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:30,158
The thing you can't fake is what Richard's talking about, which is the way that humans

202
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,039
actually respond to one another.

203
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,421
And I think, just to be contrary about this, thinking about this panel, a lot of my sense

204
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:41,183
of these questions of how do we make computers do these things.

205
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,226
They suck at a lot of this stuff.

206
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:43,506
Yeah, they do.

207
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,327
And we have millions of years of evolution

208
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:48,308
having us focus on the kind of stuff

209
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,129
that Richard was just talking about, our primate ancestors.

210
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,510
There's all sorts of, my sister used to work with chimps.

211
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,111
And being with a group of chimps and being

212
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:58,531
with a group of game developers, it

213
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,632
can be really hard to tell the difference.

214
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:01,952
Ha, ha, ha.

215
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,613
But he made that joke and not me.

216
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:04,153
No, no, no.

217
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,133
This is, I've, you know.

218
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:10,255
realize my own kind of body language is

219
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,056
completely compatible with what the chimps are doing.

220
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:16,938
But the point being, have the AI control

221
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:21,219
you know, scorpions or animals or have them control computers.

222
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:24,641
You know, I would love, at Google we had a

223
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:27,042
proposal for this game called Bot or Not.

224
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:32,303
And the idea was that you didn't know if the other characters were bots or humans, but

225
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:35,726
your job as a human was to be the most convincing bot you could be.

226
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:41,051
So why make, you know, have the AI make the humans seem more realistic, make it do realistic

227
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,471
robots.

228
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:48,277
And granted, we would love to have it do a lot more than that, but, you know, I look

229
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:49,999
for the low hanging fruit.

230
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,681
But when do we start, when do we really start looking?

231
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:55,543
I mean, when do we really start trying to figure out?

232
00:12:55,803 --> 00:13:00,085
the subtle thing that people already do with hand animation to make a character seem real

233
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:04,166
when it's clearly a bunch of lines moving on a flat screen.

234
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,327
We don't even do it with other players.

235
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,288
There are ways to cheat.

236
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:07,848
Yeah, we can cheat.

237
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,749
Yeah, we don't even do it with other players, right?

238
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:13,491
Like the amount of emotional bandwidth that comes through with another player in an online

239
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,471
game is basically nil.

240
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:16,872
It's terrible.

241
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:19,113
We don't do the simple things like eye tracking.

242
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:23,575
We don't do the simple things like gaze and head moving to whoever spoke most recently.

243
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:25,716
We don't do body language for precedence or any of that.

244
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:32,303
But I think fundamentally, though, if I kind of summed up what all of these comments add

245
00:13:32,303 --> 00:13:41,152
up to me is we are in a habit for a whole bunch of reasons of building our characters

246
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:44,775
as props that are primarily reactive.

247
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:50,420
And if we want to exploit AI, they need to have their own inner lives, out of which this

248
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,822
stuff arises organically.

249
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:56,348
They should be scared of you because they remember you and go, oh crap, this guy kills

250
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:58,228
random civilians.

251
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:58,529
Right?

252
00:13:58,529 --> 00:13:59,089
I mean.

253
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,109
None of us ever do that.

254
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:06,972
Yeah, but that requires, it's not that we lack, we have, we have the CPU, we have the

255
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,793
RAM these days.

256
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:09,613
Okay.

257
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:13,074
It's not a question of capability.

258
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:17,216
I think a lot of what we just said is actually trivially easy and not a challenge for you

259
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:17,976
guys.

260
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:19,817
Instead, it's a matter of will.

261
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:24,719
we have to actually choose to prioritize characters over props.

262
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:25,560
And I think we have...

263
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,865
I want to read this quote because it's exactly what you were just saying.

264
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:32,247
This is, I wish for better non-combat AI.

265
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:36,251
We do really well now in creating convincing combat behaviors individually in groups,

266
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,615
but our characters can't do the simplest real-world things

267
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,459
in response to different kinds of inputs that games typically allow.

268
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:48,607
there's a reason why love stories and intimate dramas aren't getting made and

269
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:54,172
AI is a big part of that. And it comes down to that subtlety of who are they?

270
00:14:54,172 --> 00:15:01,377
Is that an accurate? Yeah, so I mean I haven't made MMOs in a long time, right? But the big

271
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:07,641
challenge in making MMOs is the fact that you need to make thousands of NPCs, right? And so

272
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,105
that meant that the answers that single-player gaming uses, which is make

273
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:17,945
you know, props that are scripted, you just can't do it, right? So either you end up with

274
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:24,168
a thousand of the same NPC, or you are driven to have to do stuff that is procedural or

275
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:31,772
AI driven or whatever, right? And the solutions to get some of that inner life are actually

276
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:39,175
not hard at all. A couple of floating scalar variables for fear, anger, greed, whatever.

277
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:42,657
And it doesn't take very much, but...

278
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:48,927
the pressure is towards what I would call a stagecrafty,

279
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,628
narrativist approach.

280
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:55,269
And so you end up prescripting the NPCs to such a degree.

281
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,489
Like, you know, in Ultima Online, we did this.

282
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,650
We had that kind of behavior stuff.

283
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,730
And by the time we got to Star Wars Galaxies,

284
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,891
the pressure on it was so much that we just said,

285
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,051
we don't need NPCs.

286
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,352
Let's just have players do all the jobs.

287
00:16:08,352 --> 00:16:11,873
And we turned what would have been NPCs into terminals.

288
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:12,613
Because.

289
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,955
we were like, well, you can't actually do better right now.

290
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,437
They might as well just actually be a physical prop

291
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:19,918
with a button.

292
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:22,480
And defense quest, please, beep.

293
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,962
I think your philosophical point is well made, Raph.

294
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:28,404
The other end of the spectrum,

295
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,126
so I think there's some simple hacky things that we can do

296
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,808
by looking at the expressive affordances

297
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:35,470
that the game gives the player.

298
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,492
Like even something like, you know, just crouching.

299
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,994
I have crouched in front of so many dogs

300
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:42,055
in Breath of the Wild.

301
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:51,069
hoping for that, hoping to be led to some treasure actually I'm afraid, hoping to

302
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:56,991
get something from that. But the way that Zelda Breath of the Wild rewards you

303
00:16:56,991 --> 00:17:00,312
with this little moment of interaction where my attempt to

304
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:06,017
take a kind of a spatial stance that is possibly socially expressive in some way

305
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:09,200
is just met by the game and even though it's just simplest of mechanisms.

306
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,343
Yeah I also want to say that games about love and romance are being made

307
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:16,766
they're just not being made with characters so I think

308
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:20,589
you know when you think about games as you know mechanics as rules

309
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,591
and aesthetics is the outcome the feeling experience that you get in the

310
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:26,354
middle is the dynamics and like what we're talking about

311
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,255
is the player NPC dynamic.

312
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:31,839
It doesn't really have good juicy affordances for romance,

313
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,640
but you can build a game like Florence,

314
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,820
which is all about falling in love.

315
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,901
And it could do really well and be really lovely.

316
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,902
And people can love it if you turn

317
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:43,964
the mechanics and the aesthetics into the main part of the game.

318
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:47,285
And the disappeared dynamics are in your mind, right?

319
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,125
So we know how to do it as game designers.

320
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,967
It's just we don't know how to do it with, you know.

321
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:57,066
first-person shooters and third-person role-playing games.

322
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,948
And VR actually is giving us some of those affordances.

323
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,130
Specifically, we've been talking about gaze,

324
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,553
and it's better, particularly when eye tracking comes in,

325
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,554
which is certainly getting close.

326
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:08,717
We're going to have excellent gaze,

327
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:11,659
not just on are they looking at me,

328
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:15,303
but I saw, I think it was Fove did this demo.

329
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:20,986
where you're being interrogated, and I happen to look at the water, the cup on the table,

330
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:25,788
and the guy bashes it out of the way and says, look at me, and it was one of the scariest moments

331
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:31,191
I've had. You can trip that around because the same part of our brain that processes some of

332
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:37,453
that fear and fight or flight stuff deals with arousal too, and the intimacy of VR, the physical

333
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:42,396
proximity that you're acutely aware when you're within arm's reach of somebody compared to

334
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:45,317
across the room, and VR actually gives you that feeling.

335
00:18:45,941 --> 00:18:48,343
if the AI is feeding off of those things,

336
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,344
realizes that a character is right next to you,

337
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,626
and it's very different if the character looks at you

338
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,487
and the character looks at you like this.

339
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:55,368
Exactly.

340
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,268
Or if it's another player,

341
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,749
and I think this is actually one of the things

342
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,851
that we should always think about as developers,

343
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,293
and particularly if you're working in AI right now,

344
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,714
this idea that gaze is gonna be so easy to track.

345
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,816
Like, the machine is much better

346
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,837
at actually catching the things that we're looking at

347
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:11,019
and our micro-expressions than we are.

348
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,841
Just like you can observe a date from a different table

349
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:14,621
and tell whether.

350
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,141
one of the people is not into it.

351
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:20,003
Like a computer can look at your face through a headset

352
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,164
and tell whether you're scared

353
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:23,445
or whether you're looking for a solution

354
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,747
or whether you're like really intensely focusing.

355
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,189
And there's a huge potential to abuse that.

356
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:30,050
So like one of the things that it's,

357
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,132
I think it's very important for all of you to be doing

358
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,193
is making work at that level

359
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,095
because if you don't do it,

360
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:38,557
then someone who cares less about players will.

361
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:40,658
And I'd like to add one small thing.

362
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:45,886
which is at the heart of this though is the need to study and understand human behavior.

363
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:50,589
Yeah. Because without it, it's all stupid pet tricks. And the example that I would give is

364
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:56,031
anyone who played Oblivion, especially, I'm sure all the women felt this way, but I bet a lot of

365
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,453
men did too, found it super creepy when you'd walk by a guard and he would say, you know how to move

366
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:05,716
in light armor. I'm like, stop it. What are you doing? Right. They just harassed me. Weird.

367
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:07,777
Eye tracking you no matter what and commenting on you.

368
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:10,287
just apropos of nothing, right?

369
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:11,488
And then they do it again in Skyrim.

370
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:12,629
They still do the same thing, right?

371
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,509
It's a stupid pet trick.

372
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,011
It's trying to make the AI look smart and responsive,

373
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:19,132
but in fact, not looking at what people actually do

374
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:23,214
and making something really creepy as a result, right?

375
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:26,676
So I think you have to study people and understand people

376
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,257
for anything we're talking about here to work.

377
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:30,538
And then if the game doesn't give the player

378
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:32,839
an opportunity to respond in context to the NPC,

379
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,720
to the sexual harassment,

380
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,281
then that game is taking a kind of philosophical stance.

381
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:43,445
I want to jump off the moment because this next section selling the NPC.

382
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:48,047
Here at the AI summit last year, our very own Alicia Laid Acker during the rant

383
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:52,989
session had a segment that almost got a standing ovation from the room.

384
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:55,030
I do want to play that here real quick.

385
00:20:57,236 --> 00:21:02,098
have this great opportunity because we can actually interact with them.

386
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:08,160
But honestly, I barely give a shit about any of the NPCs in our games.

387
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,562
They're too simple. They're designed to either protect someone,

388
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,943
kill someone, or roam around in a big city like a zombie.

389
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,324
In short, our NPCs are lacking empathy and intelligence.

390
00:21:18,324 --> 00:21:21,705
And this is what makes us really care about characters in cinema and TV.

391
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:23,886
I'm going to call this artificial intelligence.

392
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:29,845
I love that term artificial intelligence and you'll find out in my rant tomorrow.

393
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,606
But what would that look like?

394
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:37,829
You just talked about the empathy of realizing, OK, wow, maybe I just as an NPC said something

395
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,530
that was OK, a little bit off.

396
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,171
I probably should not have done that.

397
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:43,832
But there's plenty of other examples.

398
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:50,543
Um of well that that would require the writer not having done it. I mean that's like that's the fundamental point that we're just making

399
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:56,588
Yeah, it's like I mean, it's not like it has the capability of knowing what it shouldn't say. I mean, this is the whole point example

400
00:21:56,588 --> 00:22:00,771
Yeah, there's thing. I used one that if I walk into the tavern

401
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:07,436
Uh, or or the shop or something in in a game like a skyrim and i've got arrows poke through me

402
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:10,079
I'm dragging i'm at one percent health

403
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,359
Hi

404
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,240
What can I sell you today?

405
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:17,658
No, dude, I'm bleeding. I've lost an arm.

406
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:20,720
What's that, Bloody Mary? Sure.

407
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,904
Yes, thank you. Dragons blood. Two of them, please. I'm trying to keep my volume up.

408
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:34,627
So, yeah, what would artificial intelligence, as Alicia briefly described it last year in that clip,

409
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:39,270
what would that look like to you? The empathy, the understanding that...

410
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:45,855
you're caring for them because they're caring about something as well, possibly even you.

411
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:50,559
Well, I mean, part of the writer's job is going to be to identify what each character cares about,

412
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,081
because maybe he actually genuinely doesn't give a crap about you bleeding,

413
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:57,925
other than don't do it on my floor, right? And now that makes him a person. I believe in this

414
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:02,848
guy because he's like, take that out of here. I don't want your trouble. And won't sell to me

415
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:08,092
until I've cleaned up, right? Those are the kinds of things. And I guess the point for me is that

416
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:12,345
In order to accomplish this, it takes the team working in lockstep.

417
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:19,030
It takes animators and AI engineers and designers and writers all understanding together

418
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,832
that we're trying to create something.

419
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:28,858
It's not any one job's responsibility to magically make an NPC who will do what I just said, right?

420
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:29,818
That's a group of people.

421
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm not representing all the animators, designers, and writers.

422
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,260
Yeah.

423
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,942
So I want to challenge that just a little bit.

424
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:37,049
the challenge I would be offering would be,

425
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,210
okay, let's cut the writers for a minute.

426
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,292
Just cut them all, sorry.

427
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:43,834
And think about, okay,

428
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,115
what can we get across without the writers?

429
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,917
Because I think that's the way we need to think about this.

430
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:51,139
We need to think, what can I get across?

431
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,961
Now, let's take away the animations too.

432
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:56,183
Do I have anything to get across?

433
00:23:56,183 --> 00:24:00,586
Like, if I had a text output, is there any there there?

434
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:02,087
I think often the answer is no.

435
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:06,067
Right? Like, we put all the burden on the writers.

436
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,208
So, just for a minute, do the thought experiment of,

437
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,668
there is no writing, right? There just isn't any.

438
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:17,710
Do the NPCs have any brain at all? And that, I guess, is what I mean,

439
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,571
really, when I think of artificial intelligence, I go,

440
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:25,772
but none of them have hearts, right? How about, let's use some AI to try building

441
00:24:25,772 --> 00:24:29,793
at least a rudimentary heart, right? And see if they do anything?

442
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,607
Right? I mean, that would be the challenge I would want.

443
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:35,609
Because even just, what I hear you saying, is even if just in data,

444
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:39,993
someplace there was a number that was changing because it felt, you know, happy with you,

445
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:42,075
sad, in a similar sort of way, but on a deeper level?

446
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:42,295
Right.

447
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:45,177
And then we can hook it up to writing and animation later.

448
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:45,578
Right. So...

449
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:49,601
I think it's important that you've actually recognized that, like,

450
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:53,804
one of the things that makes us care for others is that they're broken.

451
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:56,467
Like, one of the most compelling characters...

452
00:24:56,834 --> 00:25:01,437
in your favorite book is probably someone who has a serious character flaw.

453
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:06,201
Maybe you've seen that flaw in yourself and then you identify with that character.

454
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:11,065
When we do write well, we generally focus on

455
00:25:11,065 --> 00:25:19,532
specifications for humanity that are slightly off in one of several vectors, maybe even

456
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:24,877
meeting DSM criteria, right? I mean, like, it's really, it's really unusual people.

457
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:28,909
histrionic people, people that are emotionally unstable, people that are

458
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,572
clinging and then cold, those are the ones that we write about and care about.

459
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:37,715
And I think one of the things we always do as an industry is we try to build

460
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:42,078
either friend or foe, but like what about the middle space? The person that

461
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:45,580
you're in love with who suddenly gets angry and doesn't know how to not throw

462
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,243
things, or the parent that wants to raise the child but was abused and so

463
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:51,965
therefore is just constantly difficult.

464
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:54,912
with a little kid, you know?

465
00:25:54,912 --> 00:25:57,113
What about an animal that's been beaten

466
00:25:57,113 --> 00:26:00,674
that you're trying to win back to trust?

467
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:02,495
You know, that kind of a relationship

468
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:04,575
is I think the thing where you really do have

469
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:05,696
to do the juicy work of,

470
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,596
it's not that they don't have lines

471
00:26:07,596 --> 00:26:09,297
or that they aren't written,

472
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:13,258
it's that they're actually something interesting to us.

473
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,418
Trying to solve the problem and be perfect.

474
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:21,634
you're trying to create a version of a human that isn't really real or maybe is real somewhere.

475
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:24,397
I don't know any of them, but I love all my friends, I do.

476
00:26:24,397 --> 00:26:27,000
But you know, we all have our difficulties.

477
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,085
So I think it really is about actually really recognizing that when you're broken, you're

478
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:35,668
more interesting and it's the ways that you're broken that make people care for you.

479
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:41,801
I think that's absolutely right, Robin, and I think that the kind of intimacy and empathy

480
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:48,085
that Alicia's talking about comes from when characters make themselves emotionally vulnerable

481
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:49,166
to one another.

482
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:54,349
And just thinking out loud, we've been talking about NPCs noticing what the player does do,

483
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,991
I think that vulnerability is often associated with avoidance.

484
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:04,528
And so maybe there's some mileage in noticing what the player doesn't do or it seems uncomfortable

485
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:05,889
doing and that might open the door to...

486
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:06,590
Well, it's more or less the...

487
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,733
Ah, the wonderful scorpions example, yeah.

488
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:15,017
Yeah, it's exactly that of commenting, wow, you really don't like those, do you?

489
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:19,901
You know, and either then cackling at you every, it's glee every time you run away from

490
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:24,525
a... or saying, hey, let me help you avoid those or something to that effect.

491
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:24,765
Yeah.

492
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:25,226
Yeah.

493
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,027
Excellent.

494
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:31,551
Warren I've left this up here for a little bit, but he was actually touching on a lot of the same things his spilled milk

495
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,572
Thing how do characters react?

496
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:42,998
It's gonna be whether it was knocked over by mistake that the NPC might respond whether the player was playing the role of a child

497
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:44,980
Well, that's okay, honey. You spilled the milk. It's okay

498
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,144
Or whether the player just revealed that she was sleeping with the NPCs husband and so on you know

499
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:53,405
There's all these different contexts to one

500
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:01,243
physical event in the world and having an NPC understand and react accordingly would be monumental.

501
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:06,005
How do we define that in such a way that we can even build that? I guess that's my job, isn't it?

502
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:14,229
Our job. Well, you know, one thing I'd point out, I think if we polled the room about whether or

503
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:20,952
not they felt emotional connection with, let's say, their Nintendogs or their Sims,

504
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,590
The answer would start being yes.

505
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,230
Okay.

506
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:30,695
And it's worth pointing out that those are simulation driven, AI driven, little entities

507
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:34,278
with inner lives of their own, their own needs, their own desires.

508
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,659
And yeah, we do let them down.

509
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:38,941
We forget to feed them and we set them on fire and trap them in swimming pools.

510
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:43,044
At that point, that's not letting them down.

511
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:47,267
I feel like I let them down when I, I'm so sorry.

512
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,829
Let me fill the pool now.

513
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,769
I guess my point is we have seen this work.

514
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:54,389
Yeah.

515
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:56,830
And, come on, Sims is what?

516
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,290
Eight little variables on a scale that probably only need a bite each, right?

517
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,131
I mean, come on.

518
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:01,451
Not a lot.

519
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:07,092
We can afford to Simsify every NPC in World of Warcraft.

520
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,092
Right?

521
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:08,752
Like, easily.

522
00:29:08,752 --> 00:29:09,853
That's tweet-worthy.

523
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:09,993
Do it.

524
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:10,193
Quick.

525
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,508
But I do think it's also a problematic game.

526
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,429
I mean, Sims was the first game I worked on.

527
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:18,190
And my first job was building objects for the Sims expansion

528
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,990
packs on Sims 2.

529
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,211
And trying to design things to go into that system

530
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:24,512
was incredibly difficult. Because what ends up happening

531
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,873
is you hack together a terrain, basically,

532
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:29,013
of interest for all the AIs.

533
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,674
And then they're all running around on this terrain.

534
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:32,655
And basically, what they're doing

535
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,255
is they're listening to the objects which

536
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:36,236
are echoing affordances back to them.

537
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:38,737
And then they're choosing those affordances based on a stack

538
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:39,977
based ranking on the sliders.

539
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:45,604
But then when you try to build a new object and insert it into that system, it has to get along with all the other objects in the system.

540
00:29:45,604 --> 00:29:56,251
So every expansion pack is like, it's like if you think of the Death Star and you have to peel one panel off and then like wire in a thing and then put the panel back on and then it just fucking breaks.

541
00:29:56,251 --> 00:30:06,097
So the game, like 90% of the design on the expansion pack team was idealized what an object would do, then have someone try to make it and shove it into the game.

542
00:30:06,777 --> 00:30:08,958
and then fix all the ways that it breaks by tuning it.

543
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,140
And we used to call Edith the thing

544
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,902
that you used to tune that game, the Crippler,

545
00:30:13,902 --> 00:30:18,065
because you just had to do all this ninnying, tweaking,

546
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:19,747
and constantly evaluating what they were doing.

547
00:30:19,747 --> 00:30:21,868
And a lot of times, you were just guessing.

548
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:23,409
You were literally guessing what they were doing.

549
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:26,051
They were like creatures of their own will.

550
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,814
And bugs that I had to deal with on that game

551
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:31,796
included time passing differently on different lots,

552
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,457
broke the treadmill so that people just

553
00:30:33,777 --> 00:30:36,157
were always stinky when they were working out at a gym,

554
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:37,878
you know, or working out at home.

555
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,719
And so, like, it seems so easy,

556
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:41,499
but there's a reason no one has done it,

557
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:43,940
because it is actually incredibly difficult

558
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,041
to sort of deal with that mesh.

559
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,521
So that sounds like something to throw

560
00:30:47,521 --> 00:30:48,642
at the machine learning system,

561
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:50,442
so that we don't have to do it anymore.

562
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:51,983
Dave, go fix that.

563
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:52,383
Yeah, fix it.

564
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:56,197
I'm just saying design better tools for your utility system.

565
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:58,218
But anyway, I do want to move on because we've

566
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,500
got a couple other topics that we want to cover.

567
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,543
Narrative is something that we hear a lot about

568
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:06,984
over the past few years lately.

569
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:10,066
And a lot of people in academia are working on this,

570
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,188
of how do we create stories, how do we

571
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:16,110
create dynamic dialogue, contextual dialogue.

572
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,112
Matter of fact, we're going to be having a talk here tomorrow

573
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,373
on exactly that.

574
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:22,054
But dialogue and narrative.

575
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:28,130
are two different things. Taking a pre-written story arc and saying, well, we're just going to

576
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,772
fill in different words, compared to creating a story arc of two different things, what would

577
00:31:32,772 --> 00:31:40,316
you want to see? Give me a vignette of, it would be cool if... So I don't want to miss the middle

578
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:45,298
spot, right? Because on the one hand you have the, hey, the entire narrative is crafted and I'm just

579
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:49,080
along for the ride. On the other side, you have procedural narrative, right? There is a middle

580
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,241
point where within Mass Effect, I'm telling my own story.

581
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:55,610
along with playing the story that they created.

582
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,770
So that's, I think, something that doesn't really

583
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,191
get addressed enough.

584
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:04,432
I think everybody who thinks we really want more player agency

585
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:07,292
starts to lean toward procedural, which is difficult

586
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,992
and a lot of times can't, right now,

587
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:11,493
achieve the same level of quality,

588
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:15,494
generally, as you get from a more written story.

589
00:32:15,494 --> 00:32:20,035
But that doesn't mean, again, that we can't spend our AI

590
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:22,035
dollars and time on having.

591
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:27,321
my path to a story have more meaning and more recognition from the other elements? And again,

592
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:31,963
it's having the NPCs talk to me about the choices that I made, right? Because I love mass effect,

593
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:35,945
but it's always super clear to me that, oh, I just triggered the threshold where he likes me now.

594
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:40,328
Right? And I imagine even like normal people who aren't designers recognize that too, right? Oh,

595
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:46,091
I just finally won his love, which is not how people really work, right? So how can you make

596
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:49,393
that relationship more interesting and more dynamic and have...

597
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:53,608
you know, Morden actually recognized more of the small things they do in the game

598
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:58,251
and not just the obvious things that are set up to make Morden either like me or dislike me.

599
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:01,613
I just want to draw a circle on one thing in the middle you said is

600
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,334
every player can go off and play his own story in any game.

601
00:33:04,334 --> 00:33:07,996
I'm going to screw with the game this way, I'm going to do this,

602
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:12,919
but it was the part about having the characters recognize that you have

603
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,702
gone off the beaten path and adapt to that and react to that and join you,

604
00:33:17,702 --> 00:33:19,403
again going with the improv.

605
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:20,256
Yes, and.

606
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:24,239
And looking at things in the macro too, right?

607
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:28,941
Because a lot of times there's no recognition among multiple characters and multiple systems

608
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,803
about what I'm doing in the game as a whole.

609
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:33,384
You're trying to befriend everybody, right?

610
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:36,686
And I think designers tend to look at it like, okay, I'll do factions then, where if you

611
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,948
like this person, this person hates you.

612
00:33:38,948 --> 00:33:40,909
But again, life doesn't really work that way.

613
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:47,072
So some sort of macro knowledge of an idea, I guess the closest I can come is the director

614
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:47,733
in Left 4 Dead.

615
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:52,013
The director in Left 4 Dead has an idea about what a good experience is.

616
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,616
You're making your own experience and he's kind of rolling things out for you.

617
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,458
You could think of almost all games that way.

618
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:02,562
As the player's going through it, looking at the macro of the player's behavior,

619
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:06,346
what sort of world is he creating, what sort of experience is he having?

620
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:10,129
Is he being an asshole in his actions but talking nice to people?

621
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:14,408
That's a play style. Someone should call him on that bullshit.

622
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:19,411
Or not necessarily leaning so hard on the character to do that job, but letting the environment do it for you.

623
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:24,993
So, you know, the simplest version of this would be a game in which your choices actually change the way the world looks to you.

624
00:34:24,993 --> 00:34:32,237
And like, you know, my next game is actually going to be procedural and procedural narrative and really large.

625
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,058
And I'm thinking a lot about this stuff right now.

626
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,092
And I think there are just a lot of good ways

627
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:37,874
to clip back on the things.

628
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:40,196
Like, one of the things I keep thinking about,

629
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:42,738
if you look at a game like Destiny, which is beautiful,

630
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:47,322
but why model the buttons on the jacket of a body

631
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:51,365
that you're going to shoot from 30 feet away and then loot?

632
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,946
Like, just why do it?

633
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:55,008
Like, that's someone's life.

634
00:34:55,008 --> 00:35:00,172
Like, someone somewhere is modeling those buttons.

635
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:01,794
Like, don't do it.

636
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:02,454
Just stop.

637
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:03,555
Like, just cut.

638
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:09,683
Cut with the detail at the level that it has no impact on gameplay.

639
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:16,045
We're not making a fully rendered, you know, 60 frames per second

640
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:19,986
Hobbit movie that needs to be badly edited. Or are we?

641
00:35:19,986 --> 00:35:25,868
You know, like, why do that? Just don't do the useless stuff and then spend, like Raph is sort

642
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:32,530
of saying, just copy someone else's eight slider thing and put it on everybody and see what that

643
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,910
does and skip the buttons.

644
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,359
Anybody else?

645
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,281
Briefly on narrative, I do want to keep moving.

646
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,502
So kind of riffing on what Laryllyn was saying,

647
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:44,504
I think that anyone working in AI

648
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:49,987
who wants to look at screenwriting education

649
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:52,649
would find a lot of good stuff there.

650
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:54,330
We've all heard of the hero's quest,

651
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,751
and there's that kind of systematization of story.

652
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:59,713
But there's things like sequence structure.

653
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:02,174
You can break feature films down often

654
00:36:02,174 --> 00:36:02,615
into sort of.

655
00:36:03,092 --> 00:36:08,335
eight or ten, twelve minute sequences, and each sequence is kind of a mini-story.

656
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:12,136
I think it would appeal to anyone with a mathematical bent, because there's this kind of fractal

657
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,658
aspect to it, stories within stories within stories, right?

658
00:36:15,658 --> 00:36:19,680
Like the beat of a single emotional exchange that unfolds over ten seconds between two

659
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,640
characters builds into...

660
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,421
You want to press the Save the Cat button to generate?

661
00:36:23,421 --> 00:36:27,583
So that's one of the books to have a look at, Save the Cat.

662
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:32,148
And I just throw in one last thing that I, you know, back to what I was saying before

663
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:37,950
that human computer interactions are difficult, but why not do computer-computer interactions?

664
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:44,331
And some of the most interesting proposals I've seen are having AIs that can talk to

665
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:44,952
each other.

666
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:50,073
And, you know, maybe there's some prescriptive parts, but the kinds of stuff Robin was talking

667
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:54,114
about that those AIs can be sensitive to the flaws that the other ones have.

668
00:36:55,021 --> 00:37:02,564
they can be tested within the rigid area of what they know about each other and not have

669
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:06,766
the incredible difficulty of some random human that can come in and ask them any question at all.

670
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,748
And they can respond to each other in ways that make the environment around you, including the

671
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:17,270
NPCs, feel more realistic without you having to actually interact with them and have a dialogue

672
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,991
and all the flaws of the fact that it's...

673
00:37:19,297 --> 00:37:21,578
the fourth time you ask them that question,

674
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:23,119
they say the same thing, and they never say,

675
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,260
why do you keep asking me the same question?

676
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,202
If you can do that well with computer-to-computer NPCs,

677
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,463
then you can sort of get around that whole limitation.

678
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:34,365
Yeah, we're designing a world where the narrative

679
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:38,647
is about you're all fragments of saved data

680
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:42,109
at the bottom of a giant post-apocalyptic server

681
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:45,371
somewhere where everyone's been uploaded into a metaverse,

682
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:46,892
and you're just all fragmenting,

683
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,633
and everyone you interact with is like,

684
00:37:48,943 --> 00:37:51,064
fragmented in some really fucked up way.

685
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:52,885
And then you're trying to figure out

686
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:54,346
how to get something done in that space,

687
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:58,308
but people are glitching in a way that makes their flaws

688
00:37:58,308 --> 00:37:59,568
exactly stop.

689
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,810
They'll know we're in it already.

690
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,931
But there's ways to write around it,

691
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:07,372
but it really, what I'm saying, skip the buttons.

692
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,494
I'm not talking about the actual buttons.

693
00:38:09,494 --> 00:38:11,955
I'm talking about all the ways in which we imagine

694
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:13,796
there's data where there isn't data.

695
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:17,427
Like, what you're talking about is there's three vectors in this person that I need to

696
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:20,429
figure out in order to get something from them and then move on in my quest.

697
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:23,792
And maybe they're not a person, maybe they're an AI, maybe they're a ghost, maybe they're

698
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:27,014
like a random, you know, half a robot, half person, who knows?

699
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,916
You know, like, they could be anything.

700
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:30,997
They could be another species.

701
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:36,201
But the point would be to, like, figure out how to lower the valence that I need to think

702
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:38,323
about in order to get at the thing that really matters.

703
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:39,423
And I do think that that's...

704
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:41,425
It's like systems writing.

705
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:43,547
It's not writing and it's not systems.

706
00:38:43,547 --> 00:38:43,807
It's both.

707
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:47,490
Which is one of the reasons why people don't buy AI tools,

708
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,011
which I think we're gonna talk about in a little bit.

709
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:50,852
So, you know, but it takes us to systems.

710
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:54,035
Well, actually I put up a slide that says systems.

711
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:54,615
Yeah, so let's do that.

712
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:56,637
Conveniently, you, fantastic segue.

713
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:59,279
Systems, you know, it's a broad term, right?

714
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:01,380
And I'm talking, you brought up the AI director

715
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,181
from in Lafayette, it was the most famous one.

716
00:39:03,823 --> 00:39:12,047
changed the audio, changed the coloring on the sides of the screen, it changed how the content was being delivered and the pacing and everything.

717
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:19,191
So that's a classic example. Is there anything either that you would go beyond with something like systems

718
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:23,933
or it could do better or something that we haven't thought of that if the game...

719
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:27,175
We've hit a few of them here so I don't want to rehash.

720
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:31,437
But is there something we haven't mentioned that if the game system under...

721
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:35,389
was changing something and how we were experiencing it.

722
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:38,371
Well, what I think made the Left 4 Dead director so special

723
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:41,954
and that I haven't really seen used again,

724
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:44,256
disappointingly, since that was, what, 10 years ago?

725
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:44,696
Yeah, a long time ago.

726
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,137
Late, right?

727
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:48,459
Is that the whole point of the director

728
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:51,602
is managing your emotional experience, right?

729
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:54,484
It's all about your emotional experience.

730
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:56,005
I'm going to take you up, and then I'm

731
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:57,066
going to let you have a lull.

732
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,187
And then right at the right moment,

733
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,049
I'm going to fill you with dread.

734
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:00,489
And then.

735
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:05,001
nothing's going to happen so you're going to relax and then oh my god there it is right

736
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:11,206
it was an entire AI system built around emotion emotional experience and I can't really think of

737
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:16,851
other games that have done that since and that's where the magic is because the magic is in the

738
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:21,915
players emotional moment to moment experience and you understanding that as a developer whether

739
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:26,058
you're a designer or an artist or an engineer is key to you making something that's really going

740
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:26,779
to stick with players.

741
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:32,011
And so any of the AI we talk about here, I think, at the heart of that system has to

742
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:37,732
be that it's about the player's emotional experience and not just about mechanics or

743
00:40:37,732 --> 00:40:39,873
pushing buttons or dialogue or anything else.

744
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:42,214
I think it's easy to do with scary things.

745
00:40:42,214 --> 00:40:48,516
I think that pacing curve is easier to do with fear narratives and really high action

746
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:49,496
games.

747
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:53,357
And then I think to Raf's point, we've leaned on other players and we've just

748
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:58,945
I mean, in many ways, the sort of popularity of multiplayer games is reinforced by our

749
00:40:58,945 --> 00:41:02,047
realization that it's just easier to let other people do it.

750
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:05,490
I mean, like I wasn't joking, we couldn't have written an AI that would have been as

751
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:07,652
good to play with for Journey as another player.

752
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:08,232
There's just no way.

753
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:12,736
And it would have been obviously glitchy and failed all the time.

754
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:18,661
And that, like, you know, the fact that people read it as another, as an AI, was, you know,

755
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:20,642
I think it was kind of a deep commentary.

756
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:23,545
on what people expect from entertainment experiences.

757
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:25,786
They expect to be sort of lauded

758
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,227
and have everything be about them

759
00:41:27,227 --> 00:41:28,627
and it's all about them winning.

760
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:31,928
But to Raf's point, I think we've leaned really hard

761
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:34,289
on other players and moved away

762
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:37,029
from that kind of scripting of experiences.

763
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:40,350
And fear is one that is actually pretty easy to guess

764
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,591
because you can do things to scare people really easily.

765
00:41:43,591 --> 00:41:44,892
We have very easy fear triggers.

766
00:41:44,892 --> 00:41:47,232
It's like at our lowest level of cognition.

767
00:41:47,232 --> 00:41:49,073
It's much harder to hook us with romance

768
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,213
or to hook us with mystery

769
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:50,813
or to hook us with.

770
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,122
you know, some sort of innuendo and like kind of guessing,

771
00:41:54,122 --> 00:41:55,763
because that's when you start to see that,

772
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,564
oh, it would be very difficult

773
00:41:57,564 --> 00:41:59,064
to really execute at that level.

774
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,206
So I really wish somebody would build

775
00:42:01,206 --> 00:42:03,147
even just a basic soap opera.

776
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:04,087
Like a soap system.

777
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,048
I was thinking that during the narrative,

778
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:07,089
the first narrative talk today.

779
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,189
Like telenovela type stuff.

780
00:42:08,189 --> 00:42:09,050
Yeah, I had a bit on,

781
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,512
one of the segments in it was about romance games

782
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:14,513
and about the tropes that they rely on

783
00:42:14,513 --> 00:42:15,533
in making romance games.

784
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,075
And those tropes map directly to the emotional experience

785
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:20,356
and the ups and downs and valleys

786
00:42:20,356 --> 00:42:20,616
in the.

787
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:24,454
red herrings and all of that, right? Mysteries have the same pattern.

788
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:28,175
So really understanding those very human patterns I think are the key to

789
00:42:28,175 --> 00:42:32,117
you know mapping out the emotional experience of the player in your game.

790
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:36,499
Warren in his thing, narrative summit, he used the the term game master and then

791
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:38,599
again in his answers to me this morning he

792
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,181
talked about wouldn't it be amazing if we could create a virtual dungeon master

793
00:42:42,181 --> 00:42:46,283
capable of dynamically changing the gameplay to meet the needs, fulfill the

794
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:46,943
desires.

795
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:49,478
And so in the Left 4 Dead, as you rightly pointed out,

796
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:50,338
it was a horror thing.

797
00:42:50,338 --> 00:42:51,638
I'm not fulfilling the desires.

798
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:53,698
I'm saying, is it time for me to hurt you again?

799
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:55,219
Yeah, but I think also, why make the player

800
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:57,819
the center of the narrative in this way

801
00:42:57,819 --> 00:42:59,979
where you're fulfilling their desires

802
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:02,200
and making them feel like a rock star and like,

803
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,940
blah, blah, blah.

804
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,420
I think actually that's what our games already do.

805
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,141
Like, winner, winner, chicken dinner.

806
00:43:07,141 --> 00:43:08,341
Like, you're the one.

807
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:10,181
And then just like, ooh, I want another one of those.

808
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:11,261
Ooh, I want another one of those.

809
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:12,742
Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm drunk and it's 4 a.m.

810
00:43:12,742 --> 00:43:14,082
and I have to go to work tomorrow.

811
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:14,882
Damn you, PUBG.

812
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:17,136
Murder Island, I hate you!

813
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,777
I was thinking Civ V.

814
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:21,880
Yeah, but we're so good at it.

815
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,761
We're so good at giving people that experience.

816
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:26,964
I think actually one of the harder things is to do the stuff that Alyssa's talking about.

817
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:28,605
You know, let's try and make it happen.

818
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:33,049
Build something a little bit softer with a little less resolution in the graphics,

819
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:36,412
but where the system is really trying to tell that story.

820
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:40,635
Yeah, I think, so, I mean, I'm totally on board with cutting the buttons.

821
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:46,500
And more than the buttons, frankly. Again, I think it's not an accident that

822
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,001
Sims, Nintendogs, and many other games that achieve emotional connection

823
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:55,223
use iconic communication, use different levels of graphics resolution, right?

824
00:43:55,223 --> 00:44:00,905
We have chased fidelity, and all that's done is create a large gap

825
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:04,447
between visual fidelity and emotional fidelity.

826
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:09,813
you know, today we have servers for these games that are

827
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,360
literally thousands of times more powerful.

828
00:44:13,722 --> 00:44:15,903
than what we had 20 years ago.

829
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,065
Like, insanely more powerful.

830
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:22,266
And we're actually using the server CPU cycles

831
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:24,788
on rendering the buttons on the server

832
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:27,609
so that we can do bullet collision against them.

833
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:29,510
Which is like, why?

834
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,810
Why?

835
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,572
And I think if it's a hard problem,

836
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:36,654
people get like, ooh, that's a hard problem, let's do it.

837
00:44:36,654 --> 00:44:37,094
It's not.

838
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,855
It's not actually.

839
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:41,376
Most of these things aren't hard problems.

840
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:42,537
When we talk about.

841
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,364
recognizing emotional facts about human nature,

842
00:44:47,364 --> 00:44:49,687
things like body language, or

843
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,833
in a minute we're going to talk about content generation, and recognizing

844
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,915
things like there are patterns in architecture.

845
00:44:56,315 --> 00:45:00,677
or you know whatever the fact is most of these things if people are just willing

846
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:03,539
to you know venture a little bit outside of the field of game design

847
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:08,082
have been studied by people for hundreds or thousands of years

848
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:12,304
they actually already boil down into convenient mathematical equations

849
00:45:12,304 --> 00:45:16,206
that could very easily be modeled and generated right

850
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:19,748
the idea that oh well how do we make a pet react or

851
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:22,930
how do we provide narrative or whatever okay

852
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,292
you know you want to start studying procedural narrative

853
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:29,057
Gosh, go back to Vladimir Prop and start there and work your way forward.

854
00:45:29,057 --> 00:45:33,878
There is such an enormous body of this material out there.

855
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:37,939
It isn't that we can't go find this stuff to build systems around.

856
00:45:37,939 --> 00:45:38,219
I agree.

857
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:42,880
It's that we are choosing to build other systems, mostly rendering.

858
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,460
The ones that interest the developers personally.

859
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:45,640
Right.

860
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,941
And there's a reason that the Sims and Nintendogs were so successful.

861
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:51,522
It's because they are beyond what you're saying.

862
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,692
It's because they are so accessible,

863
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:56,013
and the average person can't attach to them.

864
00:45:56,013 --> 00:45:59,135
Because they were made by diverse teams.

865
00:45:59,135 --> 00:46:00,836
When I worked on The Sims, it was 50-50.

866
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:03,277
It was the first job I had in the games industry.

867
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:04,617
There was 50% women in the studio.

868
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:07,919
I've never worked anywhere else that was 50-50.

869
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:09,739
Not even in my own studio is it that good.

870
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:12,661
Like, people from all over the world,

871
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,401
fans that had loved The Sims,

872
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,742
they just came right into the pipeline and became creators.

873
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:20,044
Like, you know, I can't say it enough, man.

874
00:46:20,717 --> 00:46:25,660
The narrowness with which our schools train us in computer science and AI,

875
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,762
the narrowness with which we create the community of people in this room,

876
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:32,824
affect the breadth of the things that we make.

877
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:38,788
And like, I think it would be interesting to think about the systems that you're all part of

878
00:46:38,788 --> 00:46:42,530
and how you could broaden those systems and make them more diverse and more inclusive

879
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:45,491
so that you would get different perspectives on what was interesting.

880
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:48,933
So Dave, we need you to take all of the A programmers.

881
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,028
and give them a liberal arts degree please.

882
00:46:52,028 --> 00:46:52,488
Yes.

883
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:54,049
Educate everyone.

884
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:55,790
Personally?

885
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,552
You are here standing in for all the AI developers,

886
00:46:58,552 --> 00:46:59,273
so yeah, it's on you.

887
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:00,434
I didn't even graduate college.

888
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:02,255
I think actually, by the way,

889
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:04,036
before we get too much farther,

890
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:05,577
it's time to give Dave credit for,

891
00:47:05,577 --> 00:47:09,000
how many people here are at their first GDC?

892
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,622
Okay, so we knew there'd be a lot of you,

893
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,543
and you've been really attentive.

894
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,225
If we had to make up some,

895
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:21,132
you know, presence who really wasn't here but kept saying these sage things and he was

896
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:25,639
kind of this ghostly thing. And it was the narrative summit. Wouldn't the narrative come

897
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,462
up with someone and call him a specter?

898
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:32,127
You've all fallen for it really well.

899
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:33,027
I love it.

900
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:37,929
You probably got some more of this Warren Spector person, but I'd love to hear it.

901
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:38,829
I've never heard of him.

902
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:39,209
Oh, God.

903
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:41,690
I can't wait until he watches this and emails me.

904
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,451
We love you, Warren.

905
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:43,211
That's it.

906
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:44,771
Don't break character.

907
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:45,492
I love it.

908
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:47,713
All right.

909
00:47:47,713 --> 00:47:53,195
So, moving on, I do want to blast through this section on content generation.

910
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:56,636
There's been a lot over the past number of years, even here in the AI Summit.

911
00:47:57,178 --> 00:48:03,064
about procedural content generation, which of course means so many different things,

912
00:48:03,064 --> 00:48:07,068
whether it be art styles or texturing or creating buildings.

913
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:13,295
Even just it started by roguelikes, we're going to create random mazes or something like that.

914
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:16,779
But it's gone beyond that.

915
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:19,461
And a lot of the things we talk about, how do we create?

916
00:48:20,155 --> 00:48:24,699
you know these huge worlds without you know artists and designers sitting there and doing

917
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:30,323
you know every single building or copy and pasting you know five thousand of the same

918
00:48:30,323 --> 00:48:30,723
building.

919
00:48:30,723 --> 00:48:34,966
But I feel that there's something else that we could generate it.

920
00:48:34,966 --> 00:48:36,988
What is it that you in your design.

921
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:41,288
God, if we could only just push a button and have this stuff appear, what would it be?

922
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:48,655
One of the coolest things I've seen with using AI for content generation was the deep dream

923
00:48:48,655 --> 00:48:53,720
stuff that allows you to take one picture and combine it with usually some artist, some

924
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,484
abstract artist, and you get some beautiful mashup of those two.

925
00:48:58,484 --> 00:49:03,829
And imagine if the structure of a level was, you know...

926
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,792
the same for everyone, but each player could pick their own art style

927
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:12,134
and have that be reflected in how that level looked.

928
00:49:12,134 --> 00:49:15,315
It's something we can individualize right now and it's one of those things

929
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:17,396
that computers do really well that

930
00:49:17,396 --> 00:49:20,798
doesn't get into the sort of squishy stuff that we're all

931
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:24,219
having trouble doing. Yeah, I mean just if you think about like a basic RPG where you

932
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:24,800
pick like,

933
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,741
okay, I'm gonna be the Goth Lolita costume person, then just like everything in the

934
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:31,062
world has got candy cane stripes and ribbons on it,

935
00:49:31,062 --> 00:49:33,323
you know, like just make everything cute.

936
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:37,544
you know, but dead.

937
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:38,204
That took a turn.

938
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:46,006
Yeah, for me a lot of this is about making a data-rich environment, right, because again

939
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:50,327
it feels to me like we basically settle for worlds made out of stage props and cardboard

940
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:56,749
most of the time, and to me one of the big advantages of AI is actually that it's basically

941
00:49:56,749 --> 00:49:58,690
it's patient in that sense.

942
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,470
It can keep recursing and adding detail.

943
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:05,111
that is actually real detail, right?

944
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:08,853
So to me, it's kind of obvious and trivial

945
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:12,395
that we can procedurally generate better trees using AI

946
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,156
or that we can even procedurally generate

947
00:50:14,156 --> 00:50:16,518
a better forest using AI.

948
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:20,400
Sure, fine, but that's just kind of linear extrapolation

949
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,800
off of what we already do.

950
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,242
You know, it's like speed tree, forest edition, whatever.

951
00:50:24,242 --> 00:50:27,323
What's more interesting to me is

952
00:50:28,034 --> 00:50:30,475
Can you do that but in a way that is data rich?

953
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:33,977
Instead of just going for, no, let's plot thousands of trees.

954
00:50:33,977 --> 00:50:36,419
How about when I go look at a tree, it's way more detailed.

955
00:50:36,419 --> 00:50:38,080
Now there's an ecosystem in that tree.

956
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,860
Now there is a burrow in this one,

957
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,182
and the gophers live under it, and there's a woodpecker

958
00:50:43,182 --> 00:50:44,123
over in that one.

959
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:49,166
That's the kind of detail that, frankly, we will never, ever

960
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,427
be manually able to do.

961
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:52,507
We just can't afford it.

962
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,348
It's ridiculous.

963
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:59,327
and it's exactly the kind of intelligently constructed, realistic, responsive environment.

964
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:04,170
You want the woodpecker to know there's a gopher, right? Like, I'm not talking just shallowly,

965
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:09,014
again, it's not just splatting the textures, it's can we actually create a data-rich environment,

966
00:51:09,014 --> 00:51:14,518
right? Because when we build worlds today, we build really big worlds that, again,

967
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:20,122
if you strip out the graphics, actually have very few objects in them. We actually do not

968
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,343
make dense environments.

969
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:28,842
when our notion of a dense environment is even Skyrim or Battlefield or something like

970
00:51:28,842 --> 00:51:34,184
that, and you tally the objects, you actually end up down in like, what, three digits?

971
00:51:34,184 --> 00:51:36,685
And the objects that actually interact with each other.

972
00:51:36,685 --> 00:51:37,386
Is nothing.

973
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,466
It's miniscule.

974
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:39,127
It's very miniscule.

975
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:40,727
That piece is made out of cardboard.

976
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:40,807
Yeah.

977
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,648
Fantastically rendered to cardboard, however.

978
00:51:42,648 --> 00:51:43,829
Yeah.

979
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:48,911
What AI could do, even in a way that like, because it's...

980
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:54,269
it's kind of a fractal or segmented thing. We don't actually need each tree to know about each

981
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:58,551
tree, but we could do something really interesting within the tree, if that makes sense. Each one of

982
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:04,915
them could have variations. Especially if you move away, like how many of you have seen annihilation?

983
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:06,216
Any of you?

984
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:06,676
Okay, so like...

985
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:07,457
It's amazing.

986
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,479
Go and see it before it leaves theaters.

987
00:52:09,479 --> 00:52:13,463
If you've seen Solaris or Stalker, it has some similar themes, so there's both the old

988
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:18,207
Tartofsky movies, but there's a fundamental notion of humanity and what we try to model,

989
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:21,991
and what do we hope for with contact, like going into outer space?

990
00:52:21,991 --> 00:52:23,792
And Solaris is a perfect example.

991
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:27,416
You get to the planet, the planet is sentient, but the only way it can communicate with you

992
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:31,800
is by making up vague approximations of what your memories are, and then making those physical

993
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,120
for you.

994
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:35,495
And all that really reifies is the fact that you miss being on planet Earth.

995
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:38,376
So like the whole point was like you left and now you wish you could go back.

996
00:52:38,376 --> 00:52:40,657
But when you do, all your family will be dead, right?

997
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,738
Like there's a thing that we do where we recreate the reality that we see right now.

998
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:46,899
If you the tree example is perfect.

999
00:52:46,899 --> 00:52:50,661
Just don't make it a real tree, like make it that you go to a foreign planet

1000
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:51,741
and then you find an object.

1001
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:53,862
And when you look inside the object, there's more objects

1002
00:52:53,862 --> 00:52:58,364
and you look inside those objects and then like come up with the design of mechanics.

1003
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,511
that are like interesting from the exploratory perspective

1004
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,231
that's very similar to when you're a child

1005
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:05,512
and you wander out into your backyard

1006
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:06,752
and then into the woods behind there

1007
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:08,393
and you find a stream and then you look in the stream

1008
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:11,033
and you see the tadpoles and then you poke the tadpoles.

1009
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:13,474
Like think of it from a mechanical perspective,

1010
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:14,754
not an aesthetic perspective.

1011
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:17,435
And then you get the dynamics that are so interesting.

1012
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:20,675
I think we over focus on the aesthetic qualities

1013
00:53:20,675 --> 00:53:23,756
because it short circuits the kind of creativity

1014
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:25,197
that you have to do as a designer.

1015
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:30,609
And if you partner with a designer who has the kind of abstract imagination about systems

1016
00:53:30,609 --> 00:53:34,631
and mechanics and how they create dynamics, you can move away from an aesthetic that is

1017
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:38,434
really costly, like the buttons, and move towards the tree.

1018
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:42,796
But you just have to abstract away from your natural sort of—you know, like when you

1019
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,997
first pick up a pen, you're like, I'm going to draw a tree.

1020
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:50,760
The tree that you imagine drawing on the paper is like Raphael drew it or something.

1021
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,041
You imagine being able to draw Leonardo da Vinci.

1022
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:55,768
But the truth of the matter is that you draw like a kid,

1023
00:53:55,768 --> 00:53:57,109
and the tree is still a tree.

1024
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,410
It's just a kid's version of a tree.

1025
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:02,191
So if we made a kid's version of that experience

1026
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:05,393
of finding the tadpoles, that journey is a really fun one.

1027
00:54:05,393 --> 00:54:07,194
But it doesn't have to be here on planet Earth.

1028
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:09,755
It doesn't have to be this stuff.

1029
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:11,636
It can be abstractly related.

1030
00:54:11,636 --> 00:54:14,797
And I think that content generation is about, I think,

1031
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:17,118
getting away from this notion of reality

1032
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:19,720
and towards the notion of experience.

1033
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:28,929
We're down to about five minutes and I wanted to play this next clip because it actually does speak to the difference between

1034
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:37,357
The the set pieces the the art of the stuff that the rendering the world that we're creating

1035
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:43,243
And what would be the equivalent of that? This comes from the critical. What is it called?

1036
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:44,684
critical play project

1037
00:54:44,879 --> 00:54:50,065
which is a whole bunch of video clips of a variety of designers. I think some of you have actually been part of them too.

1038
00:54:50,065 --> 00:54:53,048
And this is from Clint Hocking.

1039
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:59,915
And he was talking about his experiences in Far Cry 2 and something he encountered in his own game.

1040
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:02,538
I'll go ahead and play the clip here.

1041
00:55:04,117 --> 00:55:04,497
criminal.

1042
00:55:04,497 --> 00:55:10,799
The first time we got in the weather system, we were driving around through this dusty

1043
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:16,081
savannah area and running a little gunfight in some little shack.

1044
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:17,902
A little shack to look for some health supplies.

1045
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:23,304
We sort of tossed the place and when I turned to walk out, this storm had come in and it

1046
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:24,085
was pouring.

1047
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:26,626
Suddenly it was pouring rain out of the sky and I stopped.

1048
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:31,448
I stopped myself at the threshold of the doorway because I didn't want to get wet.

1049
00:55:33,268 --> 00:55:36,090
Like that was like, oh, and there was a moment where I was like,

1050
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,832
I'm not going to get wet, it's a video game.

1051
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:42,134
But the world was so visually compellingly real

1052
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:49,519
that that first instinct I had was to not step out into the pouring rain.

1053
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:54,923
All right, I love that because we've all had that experience

1054
00:55:54,923 --> 00:55:58,165
in games where it's like, oh, because of the sound and the

1055
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:00,507
and the visuals and, you know, this.

1056
00:56:00,913 --> 00:56:06,156
it made us realize, it's the suspension of disbelief that we all talk about in this.

1057
00:56:06,156 --> 00:56:11,138
My question is, okay, I didn't want to get wet. Wait, I'm not going to get wet. That moment,

1058
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:19,342
what would be an equivalent feeling that AI might provide? Give me just a little vignette of

1059
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:23,785
if I was in this situation, I could not stop myself, but from feeling this way.

1060
00:56:23,785 --> 00:56:26,946
I didn't want to kill it. Oh, yeah.

1061
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:28,927
I just didn't want it. I couldn't put it down.

1062
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:31,969
Can I piggyback on that?

1063
00:56:31,969 --> 00:56:32,990
I was gonna ask to go first,

1064
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,451
because mine's such a downer.

1065
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:36,171
And it would be to,

1066
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:40,174
and it highlights what I think is a burgeoning problem

1067
00:56:40,174 --> 00:56:42,755
for us all as developers of action games

1068
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:45,076
and some other kinds of games,

1069
00:56:45,076 --> 00:56:47,758
which is that I think we're rapidly converging on the point

1070
00:56:47,758 --> 00:56:51,020
where because of our representations,

1071
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,081
both in terms of assets and animation and dialogue

1072
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:55,442
and visual fidelity,

1073
00:56:55,442 --> 00:56:58,284
where the violence in our games becomes intolerable to us.

1074
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:02,835
And so my answer to this question was going to be like,

1075
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:05,416
that the characters react to the violence in our games

1076
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:06,917
in ways that feel more authentic.

1077
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,818
Because right now they either don't really react at all,

1078
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:10,898
because they're tough guys

1079
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,719
and they've got to keep fighting you,

1080
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:14,999
or they kind of do these kind of pantomimed,

1081
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:17,320
over the top, hysterical reactions.

1082
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,781
We've all seen that animation, right?

1083
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:22,982
Character doing that and then running away.

1084
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:23,943
But I think that,

1085
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:30,415
I'm fortunate to not have seen very much violence in my own life, but through the representations

1086
00:57:30,415 --> 00:57:36,156
of it that I've seen maybe in storytelling or in documentary evidence, human beings'

1087
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:39,497
reaction to violence is much more complex.

1088
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:43,158
Our reaction to trauma is often very unpredictable.

1089
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:48,499
It either looks like no reaction or it looks like something unusual and unexpected.

1090
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:51,760
And so I think there is a cluster of hard issues for us here.

1091
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:55,159
It's not a complete downer because I think that it's going to inevitably mean that we

1092
00:57:55,159 --> 00:58:00,044
have to steer in the directions that we've been talking about mainly for the last hour

1093
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:03,327
towards other kinds of subject matter, other models of human experience, right?

1094
00:58:03,327 --> 00:58:04,148
And that is the solution.

1095
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:08,752
To build on what Robin said before about caring about damaged characters, if you are responsible

1096
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:11,735
for creating post-traumatic stress disorder in some character you actually care about,

1097
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:15,578
and you're not responsible for creating post-traumatic stress disorder, you're not responsible for

1098
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:16,899
creating post-traumatic stress disorder.

1099
00:58:16,899 --> 00:58:18,581
And I think that's a really important part of that.

1100
00:58:18,948 --> 00:58:25,433
an eco-style game where you're really responsible for someone else and things that you do maybe

1101
00:58:25,433 --> 00:58:29,096
just to see, oh what would happen if I blew this up and all of a sudden this character

1102
00:58:29,096 --> 00:58:34,200
doesn't trust you anymore because a terrible explosion happened when you used your weapon.

1103
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,965
That might be an interesting way of, you know, very simple ways to make you care about some

1104
00:58:39,965 --> 00:58:41,186
of these things.

1105
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:45,309
I think maybe the difference between what you said originally, I didn't want to kill

1106
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:45,449
it.

1107
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:45,709
Yeah.

1108
00:58:47,203 --> 00:58:51,287
oh my god I didn't mean to kill it look what I have done and having the game

1109
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:57,714
sell that to you of you like what Noah was saying of oh I have just affected something.

1110
00:58:57,714 --> 00:59:03,019
Yeah this is I mean I think this is the beauty of games like Shadow of the Colossus and Ico is

1111
00:59:03,019 --> 00:59:10,027
that they do and and you know Last Guardian they build a relationship between you and a character.

1112
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,601
I mean, yes, the cameras suck.

1113
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:14,742
And there are a lot of problems with those games.

1114
00:59:14,742 --> 00:59:16,182
That's another AI problem.

1115
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:18,443
But there are definitely control issues

1116
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:20,504
in those games, which are usually

1117
00:59:20,504 --> 00:59:23,005
related to budget and timelines more than anything else.

1118
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:26,687
But those games do really focus on these narratives

1119
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:30,408
where the surface of your control and your power

1120
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:33,990
is it's a gambit between conscious reaction

1121
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,351
from the system or an unconscious or unwanted

1122
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,171
consequence.

1123
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:39,332
And I do think that that's just good writing.

1124
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:44,869
But if you could really build an animal that was an enemy that you also could create, you know,

1125
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:48,311
some kind of a relationship with through some sort of hardship at the end, like,

1126
00:59:48,311 --> 00:59:52,453
it's going to eat you because it's hungry and you have to put it down, but you don't want to.

1127
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:57,636
Like, that would be a really, like, like a bear that you raise that will eventually eat you

1128
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,457
and then you have to make a decision at the end.

1129
00:59:59,457 --> 01:00:02,799
Do you sacrifice yourself and let it live or do you take its life?

1130
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,261
Like, that's a, that would be a really interesting game to play

1131
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:08,822
and I think it would create a lot of conversation about what.

1132
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:11,377
you know, what games are about and empowering users.

1133
01:00:11,377 --> 01:00:14,119
I don't think these things are impossible to imagine.

1134
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:15,821
I just think that we're focused on the wrong things.

1135
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,622
A friendly robot named, I don't know,

1136
01:00:17,622 --> 01:00:19,163
Floyd who sacrifices himself for you.

1137
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:21,165
Like we've been doing it the whole time.

1138
01:00:21,165 --> 01:00:22,646
You know, Chris Crawford actually

1139
01:00:22,646 --> 01:00:24,067
in The Art of Computer Game Design,

1140
01:00:24,067 --> 01:00:26,469
there is like a direct quote about this.

1141
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:29,512
He's just like, the more fixed bits there are in your game,

1142
01:00:29,512 --> 01:00:31,353
the less of a good game it is.

1143
01:00:31,683 --> 01:00:33,905
There should not be fixed data in your game.

1144
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:35,306
It should be dynamic.

1145
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:37,027
It should always be changing.

1146
01:00:37,027 --> 01:00:38,308
The story should be changing.

1147
01:00:38,308 --> 01:00:40,150
The character should be changing.

1148
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,811
The art should be changing.

1149
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:42,792
He said this in 1982.

1150
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:43,392
You know?

1151
01:00:43,392 --> 01:00:45,614
Kind of the corollary to Sid's game

1152
01:00:45,614 --> 01:00:47,435
is a series of interesting choices.

1153
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:47,555
Yes.

1154
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:49,196
Interesting ramifications.

1155
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:50,257
Or responses.

1156
01:00:50,257 --> 01:00:50,778
Yeah, responses.

1157
01:00:50,778 --> 01:00:53,640
So Warren, he says the easy answer

1158
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,382
is just an NPC would hesitate to go out in the rain, too.

1159
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:58,623
I imagine that, whoa, jeez, it's raining.

1160
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:03,448
and have that be unscripted, or encourage the player to go out,

1161
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:05,089
oh, would you just get out there?

1162
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:05,889
I could see that.

1163
01:01:05,889 --> 01:01:09,330
But what's another way that the AI would just blow you away,

1164
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,411
that, oh, wow, that just happened?

1165
01:01:11,411 --> 01:01:15,272
Well, the thing I don't like about Warren's answer

1166
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:18,172
is that it comes back down to the player at the bottom.

1167
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:21,153
And I want to de-center the player, frankly.

1168
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:23,954
The reason I love games like, um,

1169
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:26,765
the stuff done by David Reilly, right?

1170
01:01:26,765 --> 01:01:29,006
Or Mountain and everything and so on,

1171
01:01:29,006 --> 01:01:32,847
is because they make you realize, well, you're not it, okay?

1172
01:01:32,847 --> 01:01:36,209
Inside the game, there is an inner life.

1173
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:37,809
Inside the game, there are systems,

1174
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:39,030
there are parts that are moving,

1175
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,271
there is clockwork and magic and soul,

1176
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:44,052
and all this is gonna go on whether you are here or not, okay?

1177
01:01:44,052 --> 01:01:45,972
And so, to a degree, I almost go,

1178
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:50,234
the game that makes you feel guilty over killing something,

1179
01:01:50,234 --> 01:01:50,514
or the game...

1180
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:55,974
That's almost just like, that's the baby step to getting you to realize that there is an

1181
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:57,014
inner life back there.

1182
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:57,615
Yeah, that's true.

1183
01:01:57,615 --> 01:02:01,217
The step beyond would be, I want to be proud of that thing.

1184
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:06,160
I want to, you know, feel good because that thing did something without me, right?

1185
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,023
That it's alive, that it's doing things on its own, right?

1186
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:11,404
I want to de-center the player from this.

1187
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:12,945
The parenting game.

1188
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:14,166
The raising a child game.

1189
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:19,269
Yeah, the AI, the systems, they're about conjuring a kind of life.

1190
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:25,312
And if that's the case, then the thing that would blow me away is actually not just the realization,

1191
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:30,536
holy shit that's alive, but it's doing things I didn't expect that weren't about me.

1192
01:02:30,536 --> 01:02:32,117
And as an individual with a point of view.

1193
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:32,857
Yes.

1194
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:37,100
Kate and Sergio earlier today in this very room had a really great example about

1195
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:47,039
Navmesh that's flagged for keep off the grass signs so that NPCs will only go on the grass under certain circumstances

1196
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,002
Unless they know all the words to this is your land

1197
01:02:51,002 --> 01:02:59,769
We are over time and I did I'm just not even gonna put this up but for a second Harvey Smith

1198
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:06,955
Had jumped onto something talking about relationships and everything. But this bit right here is

1199
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:12,195
every time we start a new project, we have to almost start from scratch.

1200
01:03:12,195 --> 01:03:16,457
We need to kind of, I'm not talking about, you know,

1201
01:03:16,457 --> 01:03:19,198
coming up with the one way of doing everything,

1202
01:03:19,198 --> 01:03:23,460
but he touches on the fact that why are we starting over and over and over and over again?

1203
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,821
And because of that, it becomes prohibitive,

1204
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:29,543
because we don't have three years to iterate on this system.

1205
01:03:29,543 --> 01:03:32,765
So there could be a quite simple answer to this, if I can dive straight in,

1206
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:36,807
because we lack something that other creative industries have, which is consortiums.

1207
01:03:37,244 --> 01:03:40,346
or consortia perhaps, where the movie studios get together

1208
01:03:40,346 --> 01:03:41,746
and they agree on technical standards

1209
01:03:41,746 --> 01:03:43,748
around what the cameras are gonna do,

1210
01:03:43,748 --> 01:03:46,589
and then the hardware manufacturers manufacture that.

1211
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:48,450
And we have the beginnings of that

1212
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,472
with the stability of our hardware platforms.

1213
01:03:51,472 --> 01:03:55,134
I think we lack it right now, except in rendering.

1214
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:59,196
The world representations are all different,

1215
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:01,317
and so how do we plug into all that?

1216
01:04:01,317 --> 01:04:03,678
We have to establish not just the AI,

1217
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:05,239
how do we represent stuff?

1218
01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:07,622
Right, right, and it is happening, right?

1219
01:04:07,622 --> 01:04:13,983
I mean in places, it happens in places like this room where we agree on the name of something like a piece of NavMesh and

1220
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:17,304
share our best practices, but I wonder as we go forward

1221
01:04:17,304 --> 01:04:20,264
we could be benefited by getting together on an industrial scale.

1222
01:04:20,264 --> 01:04:23,165
Do more industrial organization.

1223
01:04:23,165 --> 01:04:30,566
Real quick, give me two sentences, your final wishes if you had your AI team,

1224
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:34,307
me, all of the AI programmers in the world,

1225
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:38,706
And you said, I need this out of you,

1226
01:04:38,706 --> 01:04:40,988
so I can make that thing that I want to get.

1227
01:04:40,988 --> 01:04:42,249
What would it be?

1228
01:04:42,249 --> 01:04:42,810
I'm here.

1229
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,611
I'm thousands of AI devs.

1230
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:47,193
And I've been putting in greatly.

1231
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:51,437
I want you to help me build a very intimate romance

1232
01:04:51,437 --> 01:04:57,923
about two strong black women who fall in love.

1233
01:04:57,923 --> 01:04:59,604
Oddly specific.

1234
01:04:59,604 --> 01:04:59,804
OK.

1235
01:05:00,498 --> 01:05:06,000
I'm embarrassed to say that I just, and maybe this is the most important thing, I realize

1236
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,843
that all my experience as a designer has led me to think, don't solve the problem, I'll

1237
01:05:11,843 --> 01:05:14,304
just have to design around the limitations.

1238
01:05:14,304 --> 01:05:20,847
So maybe that's just a statement, you know, not to make enemies, but the limitations of

1239
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:22,128
where we're at right now.

1240
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:25,550
That's why we're here, is we're trying to figure out what, what are we missing?

1241
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,870
So you folks over here.

1242
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:27,290
I'll go.

1243
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,971
I, help me.

1244
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:29,532
Give me.

1245
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:35,715
tools to help me illustrate in my games the way that human beings struggle and we're all

1246
01:05:35,715 --> 01:05:37,295
just trying to get through.

1247
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:40,117
I think there's a lot of good literary meaningful stuff.

1248
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:44,999
It's going back to the empathy thing of the characters, you being able to be malleable

1249
01:05:44,999 --> 01:05:45,119
and...

1250
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:48,360
Connect to a lot of different things, but yeah, more human stuff.

1251
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:48,440
Okay.

1252
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,821
Laureline?

1253
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:55,283
So almost all games are online in some capacity now and gathering metrics, but certainly and

1254
01:05:55,283 --> 01:05:58,365
especially for all the games that actually are online and gathering metrics now...

1255
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:01,377
Please take some of that effort you're

1256
01:06:01,377 --> 01:06:05,519
using toward gathering metrics and looking at play patterns.

1257
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:07,579
And please use them to help the player experience,

1258
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:09,200
and not just to make money.

1259
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,421
OK, yeah, absolutely.

1260
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:10,961
Raf, what do you got?

1261
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:11,681
I want it all.

1262
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:13,102
I mean, I want it all.

1263
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,522
You're a big help.

1264
01:06:14,522 --> 01:06:17,124
This guy here.

1265
01:06:17,124 --> 01:06:22,226
I want to have the tools, the machine learning, the AI,

1266
01:06:22,226 --> 01:06:24,807
the rich data environment, to be able to make

1267
01:06:24,807 --> 01:06:25,247
a single.

1268
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:33,116
probably online connected universe that we are in fact simulating down to the point where

1269
01:06:33,116 --> 01:06:38,220
the little pink alien gophers on the 13th planet around that particular green sun, which

1270
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,865
was entirely procedurally generated, actually have a history and care about one another.

1271
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:50,191
And I wanted to have all of that stuff and have all of it be alive specifically because

1272
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:54,255
I want to drop a player into that world and have them realize.

1273
01:06:55,562 --> 01:07:00,065
as they play, that they are touching lives,

1274
01:07:00,065 --> 01:07:02,226
messing with things that are alive,

1275
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,707
they are trampling grass that struggled to grow,

1276
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:07,128
God damn it, and you're stepping on me again

1277
01:07:07,128 --> 01:07:10,050
to realize that when they build their virtual cities,

1278
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,411
when they conquer their virtual enemies

1279
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:15,552
that they are being colonialist about,

1280
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:16,813
you know, all of those things,

1281
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:19,294
I want them to realize that in their daily lives

1282
01:07:19,294 --> 01:07:21,575
they do the same thing in the real world

1283
01:07:21,575 --> 01:07:22,456
because I want.

1284
01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:28,525
the AI and the machine learning and the code and the systems out there to hold a mirror

1285
01:07:28,525 --> 01:07:30,866
back up to us as humans.

1286
01:07:30,866 --> 01:07:39,049
I want them to use that space as practice for being better here.

1287
01:07:39,049 --> 01:07:48,693
So give me all of it so that people can wake up and realize what they do day to day.

1288
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:53,560
Earlier this evening I said, oh I don't have an end slide to put up on the screen and I

1289
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,581
just made this up.

1290
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:55,762
But tell me if this resonates.

1291
01:07:55,762 --> 01:07:59,924
Not more of the same, more of the different.

1292
01:07:59,924 --> 01:08:07,749
Not just better NPC AI, but better AI NPCs and a better game AI that makes the whole

1293
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:08,989
game better.

1294
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:14,633
Slash S. S slash game slash world.

1295
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:15,093
Okay.

1296
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:15,573
Yeah.

1297
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:16,113
Okay.

1298
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:16,374
Right.

1299
01:08:17,478 --> 01:08:23,240
Replace game with world and I'm on board with that lesson. All right. Excellent again. I'm sorry. We're over time

1300
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:29,783
But was this informative and inspirational?

1301
01:08:29,783 --> 01:08:31,864
And real quick

1302
01:08:31,864 --> 01:08:37,547
who here said some point in the past hour and nine minutes said I

1303
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:43,709
Have an idea of what I could do to possibly start solving some of these

1304
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:45,670
That's why we're here

1305
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:47,405
Go forth and do it.

1306
01:08:47,405 --> 01:08:50,208
But be back here at 10 o'clock in the morning for the second day of the AI Summit.

1307
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,770
Thank you folks.

1308
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,470
Appreciate it.
