1
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:06,716
We should begin.

2
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:10,159
That means it's time for me to ask you all,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,261
are you ready to log in?

4
00:00:15,423 --> 00:00:15,864
Yes?

5
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:16,364
Yes.

6
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,166
All right, let's go.

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,292
Welcome to the classic game postmortem for Ultima Online,

8
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,254
20 years going strong.

9
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:34,198
In alphabetical order, Richard Garriott, Lord British.

10
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:42,053
What did you do on this game?

11
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:44,114
I was there.

12
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:48,136
Star Long.

13
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,539
Original Game Director.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:55,781
Me.

15
00:00:56,901 --> 00:00:57,922
Original Lead Designer.

16
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:02,764
Rich Vogel.

17
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:07,767
What did you do on this game?

18
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:09,848
I was the Live Producer.

19
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:14,145
All right, we need to travel back in time.

20
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:16,986
To 1995.

21
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:20,728
So just a reminder of what technology was like.

22
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:26,270
So the height of technology was a 28 8 modem and a so this is you know,

23
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,231
your network currently is 20 2500 times faster.

24
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,473
Okay, the state-of-the-art CPU is a 33 megahertz, you know, so.

25
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:41,827
you know a four core PC is a thousand times faster than what we were working

26
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:47,510
with back then okay. 16 megabytes of RAM you probably have a thousand times the

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,573
amount of RAM that we were working with. One megabyte 16-bit video card okay so

28
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,955
you probably have 8,000 times the amount of video RAM right now and 260 megabyte

29
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:58,956
hard drive okay your phone

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,663
The thing in your pocket has 10 times the amount of storage that we were working with.

31
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:14,065
So that's just the kind of limitations we were working with.

32
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:18,628
And then we've got like, so what was happening in the space of the kind of games that we were?

33
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:22,831
So the other games in the space were things like Air Warrior, Neverwinter Nights,

34
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:25,993
and of course, The Realm.

35
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:32,116
So these, and Dragonspires, and if Dr. Cat was here, we would go, Dr. Cat, Dragonspires.

36
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:33,978
Tell him later that we gave him a shout out.

37
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:34,218
Yes.

38
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,831
And then of course, really the thing that I give the most credit is Mudds and Moos,

39
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:46,574
and that's where of course Mr. Raff here came from. And so that's kind of the general environment

40
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:51,576
that we were working in at the time. Things have changed. Yes, things have changed quite a bit.

41
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:57,499
And then, so what was the start of all this? It was what we affectionately call Multima.

42
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,459
But if you look back at Origins history,

43
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,719
when we first started making,

44
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,440
or when I really first started making Ultima

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,182
back in the late 70s and early 80s,

46
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:11,104
they were always simulations of a party-based

47
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,325
live-action Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

48
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:16,186
And so doing a multiplayer Ultima

49
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:20,488
is something we talked about year after year after year.

50
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,350
But Star just went through the games that were out

51
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,971
kind of ahead of Ultima Online,

52
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,973
and most of those were games that you had to pay per minute.

53
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,386
or at least per hour, to a dial-up bulletin board service.

54
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:37,390
And so they were very expensive to use.

55
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:41,054
And the total user numbers were pretty small.

56
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:42,855
And so years would go by.

57
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,338
We would sit down and we'd talk about it.

58
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:46,939
We'd even go talk to the people who made the games

59
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,180
that you just saw flash by.

60
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,843
We'd debate whether we could justify

61
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:55,247
spending an Ultima scale budget on an online game.

62
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:58,608
And year after year, the answer was no.

63
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,068
The time was not right.

64
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:01,288
Until.

65
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,810
So I was in QA at the time, actually.

66
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,631
And the inspiration, actually, for UO,

67
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,952
I affectionately call it the rocket to the face.

68
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:13,813
And we were playing.

69
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:16,914
During lunchtime, Doom had come out,

70
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:20,115
and we would have these multiplayer sessions of Doom.

71
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:25,457
And I came around a corner and we would race for the rocket launcher.

72
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,760
And the guy, somebody beat me to the rocket launcher and I raced around the corner and

73
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,941
I got a rocket to the face.

74
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:37,185
And it was this inspiration of like, oh my god, players are really fun to play with and

75
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:37,986
more fun than AI.

76
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:57,296
And it was these conversations about a multiplayer Ultima and recreating that feeling of playing Dungeons and Dragons and having that social experience of playing multiplayer RPGs on paper, and looking at the other things that were happening with mods and moves.

77
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:08,622
And so going to Richard and saying, really? And then looking at what was happening with the internet and looking at what was happening with the World Wide Web had just happened. I mean, this is literally just happened.

78
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,433
Websites were just becoming a thing and it was like now is the time we really should

79
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:21,235
Do this and we should convince our parent company electronic arts to give us money to make this happen

80
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:24,937
And so that we came up with this pitch for Ultima online

81
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,180
It was still called multiple at the time multiplayer Ultima and then we started pitching it to yeah

82
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,144
And and and as with many big companies the pitch process is you put together a design document

83
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,886
Which is mostly going to be thrown away if you start working on the game, you're probably familiar with this

84
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,793
You put together the technology plan,

85
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:47,216
which also probably won't survive any form of utilization,

86
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:49,097
and you hand that over to the marketing team,

87
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,419
and the marketing team does sales projections based on that,

88
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,421
and then they do a cost return on investment

89
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:54,662
based upon those sales and decide

90
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:56,203
if they're gonna green light you or shoot you down.

91
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,124
But at this point in time, don't forget,

92
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:00,826
there had never been any product released

93
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:03,868
that was referred to as a massively multiplayer game.

94
00:06:04,713 --> 00:06:07,754
And so we went to go pitch this massively multiplayer game,

95
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,354
the sales department would look at that and go like,

96
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,655
hey, it's an Ultima, that's cool,

97
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:11,635
there's at least some audience.

98
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:14,316
But then they would look at the entire class

99
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:16,337
of games that existed in the online space

100
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,057
that were dial-up bulletin board service games

101
00:06:18,097 --> 00:06:21,878
with a maximum of five, 10, 15,000 users peak,

102
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:23,739
and they would look at this,

103
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,679
and this was back when games,

104
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,880
a top-selling game would probably sell a million copies,

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,201
and so they'd look at that and go,

106
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,001
okay, 15,000 units, a million units,

107
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:33,562
you know, this is a no-brainer, the answer's no.

108
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:39,089
And so despite us arguing that the times are a changing,

109
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,289
the World Wide Web is going to be this great equalizer,

110
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,790
and everyone's going to be connected,

111
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,751
and the pricing model is going to change, we were told no.

112
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,812
So we went back and licked our wounds.

113
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,533
Six months later, we came back to give the same pitch.

114
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:53,873
But we thought this time they're going

115
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,394
to go for it because it's even more obvious that the World

116
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,474
Wide Web is going to be real.

117
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,235
And we made our case again.

118
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,982
Got the same sales projections back again.

119
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,964
By the way, they gave us a lifetime sales projection

120
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:10,247
of 30,000 units, twice the success

121
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,409
of the best-selling online game in their mind previously.

122
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,610
And so we were told no a second time.

123
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,432
Then we go back literally the third time.

124
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,153
So the third time, which is now a year later

125
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,294
from the first time we gave the pitch.

126
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:23,175
We give the pitch the third time,

127
00:07:23,195 --> 00:07:24,556
get the same results the third time,

128
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:29,159
and we literally just refused to give up the floor.

129
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:33,393
So we're in this pitch meeting, and they say, no, get out.

130
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:36,475
And we literally do the stomp our feet and hold our breath.

131
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:40,576
We are not leaving until you guys get a clue here

132
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,757
and at least let us, and they said,

133
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,718
our budget as a developer, we go over budget

134
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:46,239
and under budget by, well, usually over,

135
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:48,680
by 25 to 50% every year.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,721
We're only asking for, we asked for, I think, $250,000

137
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,642
to build the prototype.

138
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:57,962
And I'd already had a piece of paper prepared for just sign

139
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:00,444
here and you approve of us going over budget to prove

140
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:01,605
that this can work.

141
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:05,147
And finally, after it was heated yelling and screaming,

142
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:08,730
they finally signed the piece of paper and basically kicked

143
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,191
us on the ass as we left the room.

144
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:13,773
So great, we have money.

145
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:15,394
And then it was like, well, now what do we do?

146
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:18,136
Because nobody in the company had built a multiplayer game.

147
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:21,058
And I was like, great, I made the pitch.

148
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:22,779
And oh, god, I have to build this thing.

149
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:27,779
And so we got the idea of, well, let's go to MUDs.

150
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,000
People who have built MUDs know how to build multiplayer games.

151
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,422
And so I assembled this scrappy little team.

152
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:33,402
And there's a picture of them.

153
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:35,704
And we were having breakfast.

154
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,885
And Raph had this really great point of,

155
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:42,347
if you look at that team, it's a pretty amazingly diverse team

156
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:42,788
for the time.

157
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:44,729
We have a woman on the core team.

158
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:46,550
It was Raph's wife.

159
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:53,494
We have the really young team, you know, so the average age of that team was about 22

160
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:56,997
You know, we we actually have a older

161
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:03,101
First artist on the team was this guy Michael priest who was actually one of the very first artists at origin

162
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,524
One of the first artists in the computer gaming industry. Yeah, so

163
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:07,465
and

164
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:11,226
And that team of about eight, actually,

165
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:15,849
was the same team all the way up until the beta.

166
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:18,210
So we had a really small Agile team.

167
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,652
That team actually built 90% of the game,

168
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,254
all the way through the lifecycle of the game.

169
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,695
And so there's a power of small Agile teams.

170
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,217
But actually, at the very beginning,

171
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,138
it was just me and one programmer,

172
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:33,960
a guy named Rick Delishmite, who built a prototype using

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,180
the Ultima VI engine.

174
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:42,458
And all you could do with the prototype was you could run around, pick up an object,

175
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,261
and then if you bumped into another character, that object would drop on the ground.

176
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:47,662
That was it?

177
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,423
That was it.

178
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:53,907
But you could get about 100 people in the game at the same time.

179
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,608
And so we did a test with the whole company,

180
00:09:57,609 --> 00:10:02,252
and everybody got on a big conference call because we didn't have any chat or anything like that.

181
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,112
And everyone was like, oh my god, what is this?

182
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:08,373
This is interesting.

183
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:10,475
And all of a sudden, we had people who were like, oh,

184
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:11,335
I'd like to be on that team.

185
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:12,736
We're like, well, I don't have any money,

186
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:15,558
so you can't be on the team.

187
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:16,999
And we built this prototype.

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,142
And all of a sudden, we got interest,

189
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,102
and we built the prototype.

190
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:24,885
And then we ended up using most of that foundational prototype

191
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,707
tech to build the whole project.

192
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,728
And moving on from there.

193
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:28,928
But then.

194
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:35,802
We were kind of the bastard stepchild because no one got it and no one was really interested

195
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:39,505
because everybody wanted to build the next Ultima or the next Wing Commander because

196
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:42,247
those were the big sexy projects and still no one got it.

197
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,710
And I would also say that the corporation was still actively trying to kill it.

198
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,315
I mean this really was, no one in the corporation believed in this game, nobody wanted this

199
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,115
game to continue.

200
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,197
Is that why you put us on the fifth floor?

201
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:58,260
Because we were on a fifth floor that was under construction.

202
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:04,125
that literally they had knocked out all the walls and the windows.

203
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:07,067
So the elevator surfaced to bare concrete.

204
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:09,988
And if you turned right at the sign,

205
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,310
you went to see our team that was still in a converted hallway.

206
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,911
That was the only part left standing.

207
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:17,892
If you turned left, you fell off the building five floors to your death.

208
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,094
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

209
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:21,474
It was a test. Yeah.

210
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,656
And there were actually sheets of plastic

211
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,536
hanging down in this converted hallway.

212
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:29,268
to keep the dust from the construction out of their computers.

213
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:29,589
Yep.

214
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,551
But the noise of course came right through anyway.

215
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,292
As did the cold, by the way.

216
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:33,612
Yeah.

217
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:39,598
Everything about this team was given the least possible support you can imagine by a company.

218
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:44,783
There was one point where we couldn't figure out why it was always cold and the heat never came on

219
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:49,367
and we finally figured out that our server was sitting underneath the thermostat.

220
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,208
Yep.

221
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,048
And that's why...

222
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,563
And that's why the heat never came on,

223
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:56,824
and why we were all sitting with gloves on all the time,

224
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:58,225
trying to program with a microphone.

225
00:11:58,245 --> 00:11:58,786
Trying to type.

226
00:11:58,806 --> 00:11:59,186
That's right.

227
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:04,749
So my wife and I had been working in text mods, right?

228
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,450
And these guys hire us, and they hire Rick.

229
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,312
Actually, all three of us had came from the same text mod,

230
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,493
one called LegendMod.

231
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:14,674
And we'd actually, on the drives back and forth

232
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,256
from the interviews and whatnot, we

233
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,197
were designing online game systems.

234
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,258
So you can actually see here.

235
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,493
This is mostly my wife's handwriting.

236
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:28,015
She's actually the uncredited key other designer.

237
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:30,316
There were two key designers, and Kristen

238
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:31,957
is absolutely the other one.

239
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,819
And this was the only game she made,

240
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,039
and she got out of the industry.

241
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,861
You can see here the birth of things

242
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:43,523
like abstract properties that underlie every object,

243
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:48,165
the birth of ideas that today are Minecraft.

244
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:49,726
She had an economics degree.

245
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,362
So here you see things like modeling overall economics

246
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:53,703
flows.

247
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:58,086
We actually submitted the idea of a full world simulation

248
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:00,307
with abstract properties and player run economy

249
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,649
and crafting based on abstract properties

250
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,313
in our job application, which was probably weird.

251
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:10,375
It was awesome.

252
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:12,817
So we submitted that.

253
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,078
And it had all of these crazy ideas,

254
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:17,220
like what if we have a resource system that's

255
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,422
based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

256
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:23,497
so that AIs want food and shelter and desire in that order

257
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:27,679
and we can define everything, like the branches, the logs,

258
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,321
the sheep, the rabbits, the walls, the swords,

259
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,663
in terms of these abstract properties and this AI

260
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,725
so that everything can move along

261
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:37,845
in all these different ways.

262
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:39,526
This didn't ship.

263
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,668
It broke badly.

264
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,670
Closed economy, real disaster.

265
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,126
From the outset, we were thinking

266
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,988
in terms of this really vast simulation.

267
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:57,772
Even today, a four kilometer by four kilometer world

268
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:01,614
at one meter resolution, where every entity is

269
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:04,516
running abstract properties as a cellular automata simulation.

270
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:06,778
Those of you who are programmers are going, cool.

271
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,121
But it barely ran back then.

272
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,304
We thought we could actually build four times that,

273
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,806
and then Star told us we were wrong.

274
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:20,369
So that all went away.

275
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,171
And simulated all the way down to individual one meter

276
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:28,611
granularity, which meant that people could build anything

277
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,412
they wanted, dress any way they wanted.

278
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,692
They could craft anything they wanted.

279
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:34,052
Just about everything in the game

280
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:36,733
was going to be something that was dynamically created.

281
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,353
NPCs would set all the prices.

282
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,414
There wouldn't be much static data.

283
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,494
Everything could be customized and colorized.

284
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:47,375
I mean, we didn't know what was impossible.

285
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,502
So we built it anyway.

286
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:56,124
And that was kind of our whole team's attitude,

287
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:58,125
was we would just do the impossible,

288
00:14:58,205 --> 00:14:59,965
or just do what needed to be done.

289
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:05,248
And in fact, so we built our own website because, and again,

290
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,908
you have to remember, this was at a time

291
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:08,269
where the web had just happened.

292
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,190
Electronic Arts, our parent company,

293
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,911
didn't even have a public-facing website at the time.

294
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:14,072
And so.

295
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:16,239
We built our own website.

296
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,320
And we didn't tell anyone we had built a website.

297
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:20,741
We just did it.

298
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,322
And our lead programmer, the guy Rick, who basically built all

299
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,603
of the foundational tech, amazing guy, he loved llamas.

300
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,924
And so our whole website had llamas all over it.

301
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,705
And since there were only ten of us.

302
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:37,586
Yeah. And we, that's the original logo for Ultima Online

303
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,626
that pretty much no one ever saw unless they saw

304
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,747
that original website.

305
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,589
It's still my favorite logo for the game.

306
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:43,289
I wish we had used it.

307
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,392
And by the way, this website had this FAQ on it.

308
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,094
By the way, we think one of the very first FAQs ever.

309
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,735
No, there were tons on Usenet.

310
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,137
But for a commercial game.

311
00:15:57,617 --> 00:15:58,537
Commercial game, maybe.

312
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:01,899
And it promised a huge list of features.

313
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,240
Yeah, I mean, come on.

314
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,081
We promised the moon, right?

315
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,123
And everything.

316
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:08,423
I mean.

317
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:11,916
Think about what Yua was even compared to what there is today.

318
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:15,018
We were saying, let us make a true alternate fantasy world

319
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,580
where everything is alive, where everything is simulated,

320
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,342
where every single dynamic object in the game persisted.

321
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,023
Remember when you could drop shit on the ground?

322
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:26,344
Right?

323
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:27,865
I mean, you can't do that anymore.

324
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:28,525
Right?

325
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,426
A world with true consequence.

326
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:33,448
Part of the point was live the virtues for real,

327
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,169
like the training wheels are off now.

328
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,969
Right?

329
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:38,585
We're not going to give you little quests necessarily

330
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,966
so that you know how to act.

331
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,106
We were saying, no, you have to actually know.

332
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,047
You've had, come on, you've had eight games and nine games,

333
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,068
10 games at that point with all the spin-offs, right?

334
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:49,689
You should know by now what the virtues are.

335
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:50,430
Start behaving.

336
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,232
And a game where combat and crafting and role-playing

337
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,233
were all equally important instead of killing

338
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:00,013
being the only thing.

339
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,174
So we promised the moon, and it turned out

340
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,395
people liked the promise.

341
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:05,095
Well, and.

342
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,840
What's interesting also about when we put up

343
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,340
that first website, or something we announced

344
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,221
on that website, is by the time we got around

345
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:15,922
to being willing to let people come in and test the game,

346
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,302
we'd now already spent our $250,000

347
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:22,003
that we had barely managed to eke out.

348
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:24,103
And we suddenly came to this point where we're going like,

349
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,804
well, now that we have this game,

350
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:29,604
it's much larger than these slow modems could download.

351
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:32,065
People couldn't download the whole game practically.

352
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,451
And so we needed to send people a CD with the game on it

353
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,271
for them to really be able to help us test it.

354
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,432
And that, of course, would cost us money.

355
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,433
And so we thought, well, we don't have any money left.

356
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,693
We could have people sign up.

357
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,274
We wouldn't be able to afford to send them the discs,

358
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,414
since we're now broke.

359
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,435
Or even manufacture the discs.

360
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:51,395
Yeah.

361
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:53,635
And so we said, OK, well, we will now

362
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:57,997
charge people for the privilege of being testers.

363
00:17:58,017 --> 00:18:01,278
So there is a first early access right there.

364
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:01,818
Yeah.

365
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,037
And so we weren't sure people would go for that,

366
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,497
but we put that up on our website.

367
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:08,857
Hey, we're the Multima guys making this Ultima Online thing.

368
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,078
And don't forget, our sales projections for the game

369
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:13,059
were 30,000 units lifetime.

370
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,119
And as soon as we put up this marker that said,

371
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:20,480
pay us $5 to be a beta tester, within a few days,

372
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:25,962
50,000 people had signed up to pay to be beta testers.

373
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,723
And that was the day EA got it.

374
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,283
OK.

375
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:32,503
Yeah.

376
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,568
And so they sort of woke up.

377
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,628
So we had all these people sign up.

378
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:40,529
We started our beta, and we started manufacturing

379
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:43,750
these CDs, which, by the way, those things are collectors

380
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,890
items now on eBay.

381
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,551
And EA woke up.

382
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:53,192
And so the other project that was happening at Origin

383
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,373
was Ultima 9.

384
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,094
And what's funny, up until this point,

385
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,834
electronic arts had been like, Ultima 9

386
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:01,955
is the most important thing.

387
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:05,405
You know, it's the next sequel to the big franchise.

388
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:07,806
And you know, that's the thing, you know, let's do the,

389
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,246
you know, each franchise has its sequel

390
00:19:10,286 --> 00:19:11,406
and you do that every year.

391
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,347
It's like the next Madden, et cetera, et cetera.

392
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,767
And you know, you're the bastard stepchild

393
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,668
who we put on the terrible fifth floor.

394
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,008
You know, you don't matter, blah, blah.

395
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:20,848
You have the little scrappy team of whoever's.

396
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,949
And all of a sudden, everything flipped.

397
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:27,630
They were like, the slumbering giant woke up

398
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,070
and like the eye of Sauron switched over to us.

399
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,650
And it was like.

400
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:34,089
Oh, you are the most important thing.

401
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,011
And it's like, all of a sudden, U9 got iced,

402
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:40,674
and the entire Ultima 9 team got reassigned to us.

403
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:42,755
And it was like, we're here to help.

404
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:44,897
And it's like, well, wait, what?

405
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,819
And don't forget all the EA middle management

406
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,399
that came over to help.

407
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:52,562
Oh, yeah, and then we got a bunch of experts

408
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,363
got flown in to help us as well.

409
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:57,185
So we all of a sudden went from this scrappy little team

410
00:19:57,646 --> 00:19:57,966
of, you know,

411
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:00,402
12 people up until this point.

412
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,702
Who understood online games.

413
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:04,163
Yeah, who knew how to make multiplayer games

414
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,443
and all the gives and takes that that took

415
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:10,164
to, you know, all of a sudden we became a team of like 50

416
00:20:12,764 --> 00:20:15,925
who, and a team that did not want to be there,

417
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:18,066
who just had had their project canceled,

418
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,726
you know, who were super excited, right?

419
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:23,707
And so a big takeaway there is, you know,

420
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,047
don't, don't,

421
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:29,143
take a bunch of people who were just off a canceled project

422
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,524
and assign them to another team,

423
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:33,305
especially something they don't know anything about.

424
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,246
Because I, yeah, okay.

425
00:20:38,907 --> 00:20:41,168
So one of the big things that when I came on board

426
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:44,409
I realized is they had no, they had a game

427
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,110
but not the infrastructure to launch it.

428
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,671
So they had nothing, no service component on it at all.

429
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:53,673
And I go, oh my God, how are we gonna do this

430
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:55,813
in the time that EA gave us to do this in?

431
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,704
And so I had to reach out.

432
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,607
We did develop a very unique system.

433
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:03,288
We had key codes.

434
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:05,870
Now, key codes are used everywhere today

435
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,211
to register your product.

436
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,452
Well, we actually had to come up with that methodology

437
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:11,734
to make that happen, because no one else has done that before.

438
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:15,516
So we came up with a way to develop unique codes.

439
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,897
And what it was was a system where

440
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:21,020
I moved a mouse on a mouse pad, and it would generate

441
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,101
radium codes for us.

442
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,022
And that's the way that worked.

443
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:30,115
And that's what someone would sit down and do to generate all these codes, is just sit there and do that.

444
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:32,015
Which was me.

445
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:39,578
And then I had to come up, oh my God, we have no billing process and neither did EA.

446
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:45,120
So they had nothing, they didn't understand what digital products were or anything else like that.

447
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,322
So I had to reach out to mPlayer to help us because they did have a registration system that we could use.

448
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:53,788
and then a billing system that we can attach to

449
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:55,309
until we got our own up and running,

450
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:57,430
because I had no time to build that.

451
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,551
That takes a lot of time.

452
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,313
And then we realized, well, Europe

453
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,374
doesn't have credit cards for a subscription.

454
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,575
I said, what are we going to do here?

455
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:06,256
And I said, oh, crap.

456
00:22:07,597 --> 00:22:09,938
OK, we'll put a game time in a box

457
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:12,940
so the retailers can sell it, but we can't take that big cut

458
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,782
out of it, so we've got to figure out a way to do this

459
00:22:14,842 --> 00:22:16,763
where we can at least get some profitability out of it.

460
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:18,504
So we sold game time.

461
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,400
on 60 and 90 day gain time cards,

462
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,081
which no one's ever done before in a retail box

463
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:26,282
so that people can prepay to pay.

464
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:28,543
So a lot of cool things came out of that,

465
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:32,105
but it was very rushed and we were like sitting there

466
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,845
figuring out what do we do here for,

467
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,166
because again, credit cards at that time in Europe

468
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:37,227
weren't widely used.

469
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:38,548
So that helped that.

470
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:41,129
Well, and to add to that too,

471
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:43,650
I mean, at an even more fundamental level,

472
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,351
one thing to realize, the whole idea of

473
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:52,309
customer having an account, a username and account, didn't even exist.

474
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,272
Like, there was no registration, like create a username, create a password.

475
00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,294
Not for single player games.

476
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:02,616
Not for, because it existed in the online service stuff.

477
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:03,456
Right, but not for.

478
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,537
Not packaged goods at all.

479
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:05,918
Yeah, we didn't have anything like that.

480
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:11,381
No. So we actually, all those systems that you see today, actually were born out of this.

481
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:12,742
That everyone adopted.

482
00:23:14,338 --> 00:23:19,282
One of the big things we did before launch, which I heard about, is we used to have just

483
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:24,626
servers that could hold up to 170 people, but then when we sold 50,000 beta periods,

484
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,068
we said, oh my god, we want to put thousands of people on the server.

485
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:28,949
How are we going to do that?

486
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:32,812
And everyone looked around, and of course Rick Dellisman is an amazing person, and he

487
00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:37,075
comes up with this seamless server idea, so we actually were distributing the load of

488
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:41,458
a map between multiple servers in real time, which no one's ever done before.

489
00:23:41,892 --> 00:23:44,333
In fact, I don't think any other game has done that to date.

490
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:45,974
No, we've got a lot to have now.

491
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,016
To seamless.

492
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,317
Yeah, seamless.

493
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:51,938
We did in Galaxies.

494
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:56,360
But anyway, so we had to figure out

495
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,402
that was done pretty close to when we were launching.

496
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:03,905
And then we had to figure out, OK, all the details of that

497
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:06,786
were never debugged very well, as we all know in launch.

498
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:07,847
There were a lot of bugs.

499
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:08,427
Dupe bugs.

500
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,309
Ton of bugs with that duping was one of them.

501
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:15,787
Because who's authoritative over what as you transfer between the servers was a big deal there.

502
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:20,909
And then one of the big things we learned is because we had to get this done very quickly,

503
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:25,230
designers were doing a lot of the heavy lifting on game code.

504
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,470
That's not good.

505
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:30,292
Designers being programmers lead to a lot of bad things.

506
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:36,994
And we realized that as we were going through and testing the game, there was a lot of bugs

507
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:38,995
because there were just things that.

508
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:45,266
designers don't understand as programmers would, and we had to figure out how to deal

509
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,747
with all those bugs as we were going to launch.

510
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:52,470
And then when we created this game, we had to have log-in servers.

511
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,373
So we had a centralized log-in server that would take people all over the world logging

512
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:58,233
into the game.

513
00:24:58,253 --> 00:24:59,934
It was in one source at that time.

514
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:06,397
And then we would distribute the people to the appropriate shards that are going out

515
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,259
to the different parts of the United States.

516
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,101
And in fact, I want to make a comment about shards.

517
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:17,203
Even that term, shards, was born out

518
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:21,624
of a unfortunate crisis of our success.

519
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:24,364
We planned for everyone who was playing the game

520
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,345
to live in one world.

521
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:28,165
We thought we'd built this world 10 times bigger

522
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:31,686
than our own estimates were 10 times as big as EA's.

523
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:33,506
We thought, oh, you know, 30,000,

524
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,147
we'll make at least 300,000 sales.

525
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,827
And of course, as soon as they're selling,

526
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:38,688
it pretty quickly in the first month or two

527
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:39,688
sold over a million units.

528
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:44,801
And so as we saw that coming, we realized we couldn't fit everybody into one world.

529
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:47,282
And for me, that was sort of a tragedy.

530
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:53,127
That actually meant that we were going to have to separate people who, from that moment

531
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:55,929
forward, would have different experiences than each other.

532
00:25:56,609 --> 00:26:03,735
And so I thought, you know, how can we fictionally make that okay and make that these, this multiverse

533
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,976
feel like a single world?

534
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:07,157
And so

535
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:09,857
If you've watched the introduction to Ultima Online,

536
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:11,958
we made up this fiction where Mondain,

537
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:13,578
the evil wizard out of Ultima I,

538
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,319
who survived because of his gem of immortality,

539
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,360
and you in Ultima I go and break it into shards,

540
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,401
that at that moment, copies of the state of reality

541
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:27,022
were copied into each of those shards,

542
00:26:27,662 --> 00:26:29,442
and so you would go play in one or the other

543
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,823
of those shards, but in theory,

544
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:32,323
they could be unified again.

545
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:34,123
We actually had this big plot we'd put together

546
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:36,524
about players being able to collect these shards.

547
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:41,084
and be able to reforge it and reunify these separated worlds.

548
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:43,686
And that at least made me feel fictionally comfortable

549
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,468
that we were splitting people up.

550
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:48,330
And of course we never did that recombination point.

551
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,953
But what I think is really ironic is I go to talks where people will be talking about

552
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,296
servers that have nothing to do with games,

553
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:59,740
where they'll keep a server up to date in the US and Europe and Japan,

554
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,201
and they keep them identical.

555
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,565
but they call them separated as shards.

556
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:06,746
And so other industries have picked up this piece of fiction

557
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:08,126
about Mondain's gym.

558
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:09,226
Ha.

559
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:10,687
Yep.

560
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,087
And the neat thing about the shards

561
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,008
is each one grew up differently.

562
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,309
So the role-playing shards were in the central US.

563
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:24,271
The PK shards were in the Northeast of the country,

564
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:26,731
as well as in the Pacific became where.

565
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,483
those were PK shards.

566
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:31,025
And it's amazing how each one evolved differently,

567
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:31,966
which was kind of cool.

568
00:27:32,506 --> 00:27:34,628
But also when we were tracking bugs,

569
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:37,590
sometimes we realized things would happen over here

570
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,391
way before things would happen in the central

571
00:27:39,431 --> 00:27:40,892
because the PKers are doing something

572
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:43,174
that the role-playing shards weren't doing.

573
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:45,576
And it was interesting to keep up with all that.

574
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:46,677
Yep.

575
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:47,297
Moving on.

576
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:48,018
Moving on.

577
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:53,282
So one of the things that we did when we launched

578
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,643
was you only get one launch.

579
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:59,390
Now we say, don't launch until you're ready.

580
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,773
And because we have now early access and things like that,

581
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:05,995
you really have to be very careful about when to launch.

582
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:07,877
And I think that has been a lesson we've

583
00:28:07,897 --> 00:28:09,798
been trying to preach ever since you all launched,

584
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,439
that don't launch until you're ready.

585
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,301
And you see all the different catastrophes

586
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,083
that happen when people are launching

587
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:17,303
because of other reasons.

588
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:21,326
Basically, I look at that as making short-term decisions

589
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:22,527
on a long-term bet.

590
00:28:22,947 --> 00:28:24,208
You have to balance out.

591
00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:29,980
What's more important? This thing is a living, breathing organism, so to speak, when you launch,

592
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,721
and you're just beginning. So it's really important to get whatever you're going to

593
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:42,123
reveal out the public test to be at a certain level of quality that you can get people to

594
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:46,564
continue playing the game. That's really, really important. One of the other things we learned

595
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,084
because we broke up in shards was the whole...

596
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,601
population control.

597
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:55,583
So, we had to have mechanisms to backfill our shards because

598
00:28:55,703 --> 00:28:58,724
what we didn't want to do is open up too many shards where

599
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:04,046
you have a dispersed population problem where suddenly you have

600
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:07,528
low population on servers and high population on other servers

601
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:10,949
and what that does is you really can't close down a shard easily.

602
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:12,910
You just can't because especially a persistent

603
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,992
world shard, that's really, really hard to do and collapse.

604
00:29:16,512 --> 00:29:20,153
So, basically what we had to do in order to do that.

605
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:25,070
is make sure that if you had people coming in,

606
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,671
we'd backfill to the lower shards.

607
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:31,972
And other thing is escalation plans are really important.

608
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:32,733
So one of the things we did,

609
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,333
we had no escalation plan at all

610
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:35,874
for whether anything happened.

611
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:37,775
So we had to develop a whole escalation plan

612
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:39,876
or a runbook on the service.

613
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:42,177
And one of the biggest things about,

614
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,517
one of the things I always talk about is,

615
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:48,539
there's a lot of hidden work to do on a Games as a Service

616
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:49,940
that we learned in Ultima Online.

617
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:54,030
30% is a game and 70% is a service layer underneath it.

618
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,952
And so it's really important to understand that.

619
00:29:57,593 --> 00:30:00,515
And one of the things we went on the services side

620
00:30:00,535 --> 00:30:01,776
that was important is understanding

621
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:02,857
how to manage community.

622
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:07,180
Because of what happened on UO, if everyone remembers

623
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,542
the lawsuit and things like that,

624
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:11,484
we got kind of silenced for a while, which hurt our

625
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:15,303
we started to see, we actually had analytics on the game.

626
00:30:15,343 --> 00:30:18,204
We actually could see DAU, MAU, WAU.

627
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:19,364
We had all that.

628
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:21,605
We actually could see the population starting to drop

629
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,766
and churns starting to happen because we couldn't communicate

630
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:24,966
well because of the lawsuit.

631
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:27,367
And once I said, you know what, we're not doing that.

632
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:28,688
We're not listening to the lawyer.

633
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,929
We have to start communicating to our audience.

634
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,709
And we could not act like a PR piece.

635
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:34,750
So there was this friction between PR,

636
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,871
because everything we said, because we're connected,

637
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:38,311
gets broadcast everywhere.

638
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,512
And so what we learned is.

639
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:44,319
we went back in and started talking to the community again,

640
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:46,080
we started climbing again in growth.

641
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,240
It was amazing to watch.

642
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,461
So that's how important it is.

643
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:50,002
And again, another thing that's really hard

644
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:53,343
is we had a whole bunch of people playing in beta

645
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:55,604
that never told us about the exploits that were happening.

646
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,265
They waited before we go live.

647
00:30:57,545 --> 00:30:58,946
Then they had these sites developed

648
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:00,807
because it was really important

649
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:03,228
because people could actually sell items on eBay.

650
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:06,330
And so they wanted to exploit things in the game

651
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,410
so they can make a lot of money.

652
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,946
Dr. Twister was one of our favorite sites

653
00:31:11,346 --> 00:31:13,828
that would have a whole bunch of area people talk

654
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,088
about the exploits in the game.

655
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:15,909
Yeah.

656
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:18,570
Basically, because we designed a game

657
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,511
for a tenth of the audience in a world,

658
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:25,313
a whole bunch of solutions that we knew pretty well, actually,

659
00:31:25,774 --> 00:31:28,255
from previous online games, from text mods,

660
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:31,016
broke under the pressure of the quantity of players.

661
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,838
One of those, most critically, and actually the single largest,

662
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:36,479
most damaging design choice.

663
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:38,873
was that we had open player killing.

664
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:43,275
It easily cost us well over half the users, right?

665
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,297
We tried so many things.

666
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:48,678
I think there were, how many did you say yesterday?

667
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:49,058
Seven?

668
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,580
Seven complete redesigns of flagging systems,

669
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,742
notoriety systems, karma systems, bounty systems.

670
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,803
The bounty system turned into a high score table.

671
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,820
for player killers.

672
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:05,322
Because the emergent behavior problem of people working

673
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,623
around what was going on, right?

674
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:13,324
We'd lost track of the power of a small community to control

675
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,405
through peer pressure fell apart, right?

676
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:17,986
And that was kind of a key lesson.

677
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,406
But it's interesting to point out here though too,

678
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:21,447
it's interesting, you know, when we talk about,

679
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:23,647
when people come up to me and tell me their favorite stories

680
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:26,488
from the UO era, it almost always.

681
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,503
almost invariably includes bad behavior of one kind or another.

682
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:34,646
Yes. People cheating, exploiting, PKing, or you know, in some other way,

683
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:38,709
you know, taking advantage of others. About once a week I hear somebody say,

684
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:45,334
oh, Fortnite, H1Z1, PUBG, yeah, those are just spiritual successors to UO player killing.

685
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:49,597
Yeah. I hear that about once a week from somebody. We hear stories like Phil gave a,

686
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:54,661
from Sony, he runs Sony, he gave a speech of how he got in games, and he gave a speech about UO.

687
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:57,997
and about the PKing he did and how much fun it was.

688
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,258
And that's how he got into games.

689
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:00,718
He loved it.

690
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:04,600
Of course, there was this other emergent thing.

691
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,382
So all of our objects were dynamic,

692
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:10,623
so they were streamed down, except the ones

693
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,804
that shipped on the CD, and those were static.

694
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:16,245
But we forgot to lock down a bunch of stuff as static,

695
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,627
and that meant that it respawned every time the server booted.

696
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,531
And that meant people grabbed all of this stuff.

697
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:25,392
They looted the candelabras off the dining room tables.

698
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,653
They stole trees, patches of water,

699
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,793
would put the patches of water in their backpack,

700
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,734
and they could fish out of them because the simulation was

701
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:33,275
that real.

702
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:37,776
These then became called rares.

703
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:41,437
And pretty soon, people started transacting them on eBay.

704
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:43,738
And then people said, well, let's

705
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:47,119
hunt for these on purpose on eBay in order to make money.

706
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:50,057
And then they said, wait, why do you intermediate the rarest?

707
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,118
Let's just gather gold.

708
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,759
And so gold farming was born.

709
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:55,921
First, they started contracting to Mexico, then eventually

710
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:59,003
to China, in order to swarm in and get all of the gold

711
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:00,243
as quickly as possible.

712
00:34:00,744 --> 00:34:02,985
And then a bunch of companies said, wait a minute,

713
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:04,926
why don't we just sell the gold directly?

714
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:09,169
And gradually, microtransactions were born, and eventually

715
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:11,711
all of free-to-play, because we forgot to lock down

716
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:12,751
the fricking candelabra.

717
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:16,454
So free-to-play is our fault.

718
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:16,854
Yeah.

719
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:16,994
Sorry.

720
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:21,233
GMs.

721
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:23,313
One of the biggest lessons I learned,

722
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,634
and this came from MUDs that I was involved in previously,

723
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,375
is we had people in the game, literally,

724
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,815
as GMs and counselors.

725
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:33,716
And there were huge challenges for that.

726
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:34,996
We should never have done that.

727
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:38,397
It was something that we should have done a lot differently.

728
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,558
To have GMs in the game, there were problems.

729
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:42,858
GMs could be bribed.

730
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:46,979
GMs could do things for players or make money themselves

731
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,799
through eBay.

732
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,660
And that actually did happen.

733
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,402
One of the good things is we did have logging turned on,

734
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:55,324
so we can log everything that's happened.

735
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:58,887
But we didn't know about it until players reported it.

736
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,229
And we actually went in and investigated.

737
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:04,271
So we had a lot of issues of abuse because of that.

738
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,433
And we had a very powerful God client

739
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:09,776
that we gave the game masters and counselors in the game

740
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,296
to use.

741
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,118
And so we learned how to lock things down.

742
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,262
And one of the biggest things is, you can see the games today versus games then,

743
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,466
is we started pulling away from GMs present in the game 24 by 7.

744
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,127
That's a huge cost, by the way.

745
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:26,290
Someone coming in the game, responding to your things within 24 by 7,

746
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:29,913
it's just crazy from a cost wise.

747
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:32,396
We definitely, it was one of the biggest mistakes we learned.

748
00:35:32,436 --> 00:35:35,899
And you can definitely see as games progressed, they didn't do that anymore.

749
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,021
Yeah, gradually what we realized is that we had founded.

750
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,412
a community that actually at the time was approximately the size of San Antonio.

751
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:45,713
Yeah.

752
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:45,993
Right?

753
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:47,334
We were running a city.

754
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:53,198
And so I actually started reading about politics and government stuff

755
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:56,660
because it became apparent that's what we were doing.

756
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,881
We were actually the government.

757
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:00,222
We had corrupt cops that we had to monitor.

758
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:02,364
So we needed an internal affairs department.

759
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:03,564
We need all of these things.

760
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,185
We started modeling like a government.

761
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,907
One example of that is how we ran patch notes.

762
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:10,846
It used to be, this is actually the very first patch note

763
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,988
in Ultima Online, very first patch one week after launch.

764
00:36:14,628 --> 00:36:18,050
And what we did was we ran forums

765
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,070
to communicate with players.

766
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,731
Think of this as like running town halls.

767
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,333
We eventually actually called it the House of Commons.

768
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:25,974
We, instead of just writing code,

769
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:29,656
would actually post up proposed changes to the law

770
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:31,737
and allow a period of public comment,

771
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,398
just like in the real world.

772
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:37,020
And then it would go into testing on a separate server.

773
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,673
so that people could go in and try it out.

774
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,153
And then only after that process,

775
00:36:42,274 --> 00:36:44,454
you know, things could be sent back to committee

776
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:45,775
or moved forward.

777
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,955
We literally just started running it

778
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:49,756
as if it were a government.

779
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,576
Yeah, we had a whole organization,

780
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,817
online services group that would go through

781
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:55,977
all the feedback that was coming in

782
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,758
from test center, the community,

783
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:01,399
and also from customer support would come up

784
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,980
and we all talk about what the next patch is going to be.

785
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:11,065
Yeah, it's important to realize there were people doing this job out there in the world,

786
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:15,325
but the title community manager was kind of not a thing.

787
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:16,226
No, no.

788
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:16,486
Right.

789
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:20,386
In fact, I remember the first time we went to my brother Robert and said we want to hire

790
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:24,247
someone whose job is going to be community management.

791
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:29,248
And my brother was like, well, well, what is the productivity of their output?

792
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:31,608
Because they're deliverable.

793
00:37:32,145 --> 00:37:34,585
that can justify a headcount expense.

794
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:35,946
And he said, well, you know,

795
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,826
they're gonna talk to the community.

796
00:37:38,286 --> 00:37:40,207
He's going like, that sounds really valuable.

797
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:42,387
It was actually really hard to do.

798
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:43,708
I mean, now we wouldn't have forced start without it.

799
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,848
But I mean, it was really hard to make that sales.

800
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:50,349
Yeah, I probably spent 20 plus hours a week on that job.

801
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:53,650
He was the best community manager we had was Ralph.

802
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,211
And there's a certain thing we learned

803
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:57,851
what you needed in a community manager.

804
00:37:58,344 --> 00:37:59,805
And we were a connected community.

805
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:01,386
EA was never used to that.

806
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:02,886
And because we were a connected community,

807
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:04,887
we had hundreds of thousands of people

808
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:06,328
that had a voice out there.

809
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:07,749
And that's when something happened,

810
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:09,390
Larry Prost knew about it.

811
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,271
That's how bad, that's how it connected.

812
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:14,212
Speaking of which, I mean, this is what happened, right?

813
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:18,514
It's, this period of time was really hard for us

814
00:38:18,614 --> 00:38:22,776
because the lawsuit didn't, literally got settled later.

815
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:25,398
But it was something that caused a lot of,

816
00:38:26,077 --> 00:38:32,703
tension between the group, the development group, and EA because again, we can't just

817
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:34,304
live without talking to our community.

818
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,325
We can't be silent.

819
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:36,306
It won't work.

820
00:38:36,466 --> 00:38:39,708
And our numbers showed that until we started talking to the community again.

821
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:45,573
And if you're wondering why you can't find like original design Bibles for UO out there

822
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:51,398
on the internet, it's because they're actually all sitting in an EA legal file cabinet for

823
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,839
discovery for this lawsuit.

824
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:55,274
I had to send a stack of paper this tall,

825
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,255
and I never saw it again.

826
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,056
No, we never did.

827
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:58,357
It was just sad.

828
00:38:58,857 --> 00:39:01,920
The other thing is, we talk about community.

829
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,942
We had a big community of all.

830
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,444
Wait, you skipped Richard's on this one.

831
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,546
What was I going to say?

832
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:10,148
Well, one thing I just want to say about this, too,

833
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:12,470
is just to go back to something we were talking about earlier,

834
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,352
is that we were a team of about 8 to 12 people,

835
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:18,916
and we got Ultima Online done in two years and three months.

836
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:26,572
You compare now to where the industry has gone to where we build these giant teams

837
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:30,653
To build you know these these amazing products

838
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:36,996
But I feel like we've gotten into this trap where we think we need 300 people to build something

839
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:43,218
and we forget about the negative momentum that comes with building these giant teams and

840
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:48,730
I think we need to remind ourselves of how a small and agile team can do amazing things.

841
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,153
But it is interesting to point out the picture in the upper left of that screenshot there,

842
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:58,459
which is the team size at the end, which is somewhere between 50 and 100 people that,

843
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:01,922
you know, only a few months prior to the end was under 10 people.

844
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:06,546
And by the way, one month later after launch, you see that huge team there?

845
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:10,529
Want to guess how many and who was left?

846
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,672
Literally, this is it.

847
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:17,893
Everybody else moved on.

848
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:20,295
Yeah, and we had 12 people to run this thing.

849
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,596
And I was just like, and then we had.

850
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:24,437
We had to hire them out of the player base

851
00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:27,239
because nobody inside the company had worked on you.

852
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,921
We were it, everybody else moved on.

853
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:34,423
The most panic moment I had was when all my programmers

854
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:36,464
left at once to form another company

855
00:40:36,484 --> 00:40:37,524
that just wanted to leave.

856
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:40,146
And I go, oh crap, what do we do now?

857
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:43,730
All right, now we can go here, right?

858
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:48,433
The thing is the what we'd unleashed, right?

859
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:52,236
You know, to this day, like for example,

860
00:40:52,256 --> 00:40:53,837
I mentioned the patch notes, right?

861
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:56,359
So we also used to write essays.

862
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:00,121
Essays that were, here's what we think philosophically

863
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:01,682
about the future of virtual worlds.

864
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:05,845
Today, those essays are articles on Wikipedia, right?

865
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:08,486
We didn't really realize quite the extent

866
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:09,787
of the impact we were having.

867
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:15,300
all of these well-known community sites and networks, IGN,

868
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,484
used to once upon a time started as the UO Vault, right?

869
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:22,246
And UO Vault, right?

870
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:23,767
Like UO Vault and Crossroads.

871
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,769
Crossroads, we had to sponsor them.

872
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,952
I actually had to pull them in and run on our service

873
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:30,313
because they couldn't afford the hits

874
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,335
that they were getting on the sites

875
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:33,496
and they were actually going under.

876
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:34,377
I said, don't go under.

877
00:41:34,697 --> 00:41:37,019
We'll just take you, put you up until you get your.

878
00:41:37,338 --> 00:41:38,419
getting on your feet again.

879
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:40,759
So about a year and a half until EQ and other games

880
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:42,180
started coming out, they started,

881
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,940
and Ashwin's Call, they started getting on their feet again

882
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,001
and getting enough ad revenue.

883
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:47,842
We actually hosted those sites to keep them alive.

884
00:41:47,862 --> 00:41:49,802
That's how valuable we thought community was.

885
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,163
It was a great move to do because it definitely

886
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:53,763
helped the whole community.

887
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:56,544
Yeah, there are guilds still running today,

888
00:41:56,644 --> 00:42:00,505
holding annual conventions that are on their third generation

889
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:04,206
of guild members in one family today, coming together.

890
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:05,807
Shout out LLTS, anybody?

891
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:06,427
Yeah.

892
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,343
the syndicate, ShadowClan.

893
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,504
And one of my favorite stories, there

894
00:42:11,544 --> 00:42:15,005
was a really young guy, newlywed at the time,

895
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:19,146
who he'd done cartooning while he was at school.

896
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:21,927
And he really wanted to be a cartoonist.

897
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:25,688
So he started making a UO fan comic strip.

898
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:28,148
And I loved it, so I featured it on the UO website.

899
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:31,989
It was all about Samwise the Bard and Skull the Troll.

900
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,650
Anybody here read PVP Online?

901
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,741
Yeah, so today, this is Scott Kurtz, Harvey and Eisner

902
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:39,141
award-winning cartoonist.

903
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:44,343
You know, stuff like that is what was born out

904
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:45,183
of this community.

905
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:50,545
We had managed to build that San Antonio-sized city,

906
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:56,427
and it gave us fruit in ways that we absolutely never, ever

907
00:42:56,587 --> 00:42:57,248
expected.

908
00:42:58,228 --> 00:43:01,329
So yeah, I mean, some amount of you here in this room

909
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:02,149
are probably here.

910
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:03,350
I get people coming up saying.

911
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,286
This is the reason I'm in games.

912
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:06,628
I get that all the time.

913
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:11,272
So that leads us to talking about some of the crazy.

914
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:13,473
So we'll go through this quickly,

915
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:15,175
because I want to leave time for questions.

916
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:17,897
So that was the heartwarming part.

917
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,539
And there was some seedier sides to our community.

918
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,243
So we were very excited.

919
00:43:25,924 --> 00:43:27,806
We were going to start our beta.

920
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:30,068
And the servers spin up.

921
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:35,049
a male character spawns in.

922
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:36,030
So we're all online watching.

923
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,571
A female character spawns in.

924
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:40,332
And the first thing they say to each other is,

925
00:43:40,372 --> 00:43:41,073
do you want a cyber?

926
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:48,477
And basically, that involved taking all your clothes off

927
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:50,258
and bowing in front of each other

928
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:53,960
and typing nasty messages.

929
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:59,924
That, within a week, had evolved into a prostitution ring

930
00:44:00,044 --> 00:44:01,265
at the end of one of the.

931
00:44:01,697 --> 00:44:08,019
empty buildings along the docks in the capital town of Britain run by a character named Fly Guy

932
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:16,443
who used our elaborate dyeing system of the clothing to dye his he wore this cavalier's hat

933
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:22,585
you know it had a big feather in it dyed it bright colors he had a stable of ladies that you would

934
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:27,747
pay him gold and then they would go and the buildings were empty so he commandeered him

935
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,108
and then you would go into the building where no one could see

936
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,441
And then they would type dirty messages.

937
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:36,705
And so that was the first thriving business in our game.

938
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:38,247
Not smithing.

939
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:38,888
Mm-hmm.

940
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:39,028
Yeah.

941
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:39,288
Yeah.

942
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:39,388
Yeah.

943
00:44:39,408 --> 00:44:39,568
Yeah.

944
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,191
Not carpentry.

945
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:42,751
Yeah.

946
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:43,011
Yeah.

947
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:46,355
So I mean, the world's oldest profession was true.

948
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,276
And I mean, he made more money at the beginning

949
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:49,518
than anybody else in our game.

950
00:44:49,538 --> 00:44:49,658
Yeah.

951
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,328
So one of the things we did for all our team

952
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:57,269
was we put them through CS training.

953
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,650
So we actually had them come in and be actually GMs

954
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,691
in the game, because it helped us.

955
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,273
And I was on call, and suddenly I got a whole bunch

956
00:45:03,293 --> 00:45:05,474
of messages, and basically people were putting in

957
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,616
these runes into the banks where you couldn't see them

958
00:45:08,636 --> 00:45:10,477
until you got into, as you entered the bank,

959
00:45:10,497 --> 00:45:11,898
it teleports you to an island.

960
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:14,380
They would take your clothes off and rob you,

961
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,563
and then leave you there without any way of getting away.

962
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,684
And so I got my call, and I said, oh my God,

963
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:21,785
I can't believe this is happening.

964
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:23,463
And I go out there on the island,

965
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,303
there's a whole bunch of naked people yelling at me.

966
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:28,644
And I said, OK, I get it.

967
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,965
I'll go get, first, let's get your clothes on.

968
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:33,826
And then we'll get you moved out of here and teleported out.

969
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:37,327
But that was, the amount of exploits in this game

970
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,307
were just incredible.

971
00:45:38,327 --> 00:45:41,748
I remember just real quickly on Christmas, I was a knock.

972
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:43,149
So I was a network operations center.

973
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:44,509
I ran the knock on Christmas Eve because I

974
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:46,109
wanted to give the people time off.

975
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,950
So what we did is we had Santa spawn a reindeer.

976
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:50,936
during to celebrate Christmas.

977
00:45:51,396 --> 00:45:52,737
Suddenly, a whole bunch of,

978
00:45:52,757 --> 00:45:54,658
our spawning system went out of control.

979
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:57,580
And then we didn't realize that people

980
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,901
could take the Santa suits off the Santas.

981
00:46:00,221 --> 00:46:01,642
And so we had a whole bunch of Santas

982
00:46:01,682 --> 00:46:03,363
running around naked saying, ho, ho, ho.

983
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:07,485
And then a PK guild formed,

984
00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:09,466
a Santa PK guild formed after that.

985
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:10,647
It was notorious.

986
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,749
And the person that I hired as my lead programmer

987
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:14,949
ran that guild.

988
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:17,251
He didn't tell me until a year afterwards,

989
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,371
by the way, I ran that guild.

990
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:18,752
I said, you.

991
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,032
Oh, I can't believe that. And then we gave out charcoal, we thought was kind of cool,

992
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:28,734
to the, you know, to the people, the bad people, the bad reputation people. Then we didn't realize

993
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:34,177
that, oh my God, that actually could turn their armor into pure black, which made it rare. Yeah.

994
00:46:36,258 --> 00:46:41,701
Yeah. And, you know, what was, what was interesting about these first days is,

995
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:44,982
you know, the quality of the service was abhorrent.

996
00:46:46,189 --> 00:46:47,570
And it wasn't that we didn't know it.

997
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:49,752
I mean, we were in there playing alongside everybody, right?

998
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,494
But again, going back to the lack of government,

999
00:46:52,534 --> 00:46:55,356
you know, in the real world, if you have complaints,

1000
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:57,358
you know, there's a variety of levels of government

1001
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,239
you can complain to, whether it's your school board

1002
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:00,961
or your neighborhood association or whatever it might be.

1003
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,623
In our case, you know, we had hundreds of thousands

1004
00:47:03,643 --> 00:47:06,285
of players all in, all seeing the same bugs,

1005
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:08,887
all trying to tell us, trying to communicate to us

1006
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:11,469
in some way, hey, I believe I've seen a unique bug.

1007
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,471
It's not unique, but they believed it might be.

1008
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:17,008
And they're not getting a response individually back from us.

1009
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:18,549
And so they think we're not listening.

1010
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,392
So they're convinced that we are ignoring

1011
00:47:21,732 --> 00:47:24,455
these very obvious problems that everyone is having.

1012
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:28,258
Yet, at the same time, they're really enjoying the game.

1013
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:31,461
I mean, they understood what this moment meant

1014
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:32,522
from a gaming perspective.

1015
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:34,704
And so they didn't want to leave the game,

1016
00:47:34,744 --> 00:47:35,565
which they could easily have done.

1017
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,166
They could easily have given up and just gone away.

1018
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:40,950
Instead, they decided to have protests in the game.

1019
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,880
And because by doing that, by the way,

1020
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,321
it made things much worse.

1021
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:48,883
And so they thought, if we don't pay attention

1022
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:51,264
to the laggy service and failures,

1023
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:54,206
crashes based upon overloading areas,

1024
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:57,268
we're just going to double down and make it even worse.

1025
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,889
So they would love to go break into places.

1026
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:02,451
This one is in some town, but they also

1027
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:04,632
did it in our castle, in Lord Brutus' castle,

1028
00:48:04,652 --> 00:48:06,673
where we actually had to go unlock the doors for them

1029
00:48:06,693 --> 00:48:07,294
to let them in.

1030
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:08,835
But then once they came in.

1031
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,581
They all took off all their clothes.

1032
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:13,281
They all started drinking heavily, which makes you then vomit.

1033
00:48:13,861 --> 00:48:17,342
And then they all started, so not only was the castle just covered in puke,

1034
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:21,803
naked bodies running around, bumbling around.

1035
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:23,964
And everybody's also screaming obscenities.

1036
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:27,585
And by this, they hope they're going to get our attention.

1037
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,586
And we, of course, we thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.

1038
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:31,286
My favorite was.

1039
00:48:32,062 --> 00:48:36,863
My favorite was when they all got in a line and turned around and bowed and mooned all of you in the city of Moonglow.

1040
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:40,903
Yes. And we had GMs approach there because we wanted to control the crowd.

1041
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:43,944
We had to teleport people out and they didn't like that very much. They started mooning us.

1042
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:49,285
So early on our philosophy was when things were going weird like this,

1043
00:48:49,945 --> 00:48:53,566
we didn't want to solve it by pulling away from the simulation.

1044
00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:57,927
So for example, this here is the city of Trinzic and a group of player killers said,

1045
00:48:58,407 --> 00:49:00,667
they formed a carpenter player killer guild.

1046
00:49:01,332 --> 00:49:04,255
And that gate up at the front, they just barricaded it

1047
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:07,557
with tens of thousands of armoires and desks and chairs

1048
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,159
so that nobody could get out.

1049
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:10,960
And everybody who spawned into Trinzic

1050
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,382
had to leave through the tiny little one-tile-wide gate

1051
00:49:13,402 --> 00:49:15,724
at the bottom where they couldn't see what was happening

1052
00:49:15,944 --> 00:49:19,547
and got hit in the back of the head the minute they came out.

1053
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:21,389
And this siege of Trinzic lasted all the way

1054
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:23,170
till the next patch, which is when

1055
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,213
we patched in the ability for axes to chop furniture apart.

1056
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,075
So our approach early on was.

1057
00:49:29,858 --> 00:49:33,659
let's run with the emergence instead of away from it.

1058
00:49:34,299 --> 00:49:36,840
And that's a philosophy that honestly I wish more games

1059
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,540
still pursued.

1060
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,300
Yeah, give them the tools.

1061
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,821
And they actually had the tools to do that and get out of it.

1062
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:46,982
So real quick, because I want to get to the awesome part.

1063
00:49:47,422 --> 00:49:51,302
So we had one player that, using the clothing system again,

1064
00:49:51,383 --> 00:49:53,103
assumed this character of Hulk Hogan

1065
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:56,984
and would dress basically in red underwear and blonde hair.

1066
00:49:57,524 --> 00:49:59,504
And he challenged my character, Blackthorn.

1067
00:50:00,277 --> 00:50:06,361
He kept issuing these taunts to me to use the unarmed combat skill to do a wrestling match

1068
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:10,884
And so we totally embraced this and we had a series of wrestling matches. They were player events

1069
00:50:11,864 --> 00:50:15,086
And it was theater troops sports leagues

1070
00:50:15,786 --> 00:50:23,271
You name it. Yeah, but of course, you know the the peak of player most famous event most famous event. Yeah. Yeah, so

1071
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:26,893
Yeah, this this one's literally in the history books

1072
00:50:28,983 --> 00:50:32,645
During the development, this event happened close to the end of the beta period.

1073
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:34,966
We were debating exactly what date it was.

1074
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:35,927
I'll have to go look it up.

1075
00:50:36,547 --> 00:50:41,130
But close to the end, and as you might have guessed,

1076
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,752
every now and then during the beta, we would do wipes, right?

1077
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,773
We'd have to reset the whole service, we'd have enough changes,

1078
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,014
the data structures fundamentally change.

1079
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:50,536
And that meant all of us had to go rebuild our characters again, including me.

1080
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,418
And when you rebuild your character,

1081
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:55,699
one of the things that was really important for me to do...

1082
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,249
was to turn on a little flag called invulnerability.

1083
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,633
And because already in all Ultimas and in Ultima Online,

1084
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:05,274
people were regularly trying to gank me.

1085
00:51:05,654 --> 00:51:08,237
And so I had the programmers put in this ability

1086
00:51:08,257 --> 00:51:08,997
to make myself immortal.

1087
00:51:09,518 --> 00:51:11,339
And so people had given up trying

1088
00:51:11,479 --> 00:51:13,441
because I was always immortal.

1089
00:51:14,882 --> 00:51:15,522
Until this day.

1090
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:18,985
When we had been going around giving speeches,

1091
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:20,886
going town to town, telling everybody,

1092
00:51:20,906 --> 00:51:22,768
thank you very much for coming and participating in the beta

1093
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,849
and we were getting ready to launch

1094
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:25,030
and how excited we were to be there.

1095
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:32,476
And we were broadcasting the whole GM announce that would announce across all cities at the same time

1096
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:38,103
But we would teleport from city to city to kind of make an appearance and we were at the last appearance here on Trinzic up

1097
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:43,729
on the parapet wall that you can see there when a gentleman by the name of rains

1098
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:49,239
cast a fire field right around where Star and I were standing.

1099
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,940
And I strolled into it and I'm like,

1100
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,482
ha-ha, you think that can hurt me because I had remembered to turn my invulnerability flag on.

1101
00:51:55,383 --> 00:51:57,504
And I thought, ha-ha, I'm immortal too.

1102
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,326
And so I walked into that fire field and fell over dead.

1103
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,109
And what was amazing about this moment

1104
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,670
is to see what the reaction was

1105
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,993
both in the community of players surrounding and at origin.

1106
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:15,018
Because again, we had no back channel communication

1107
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:18,100
amongst ourselves other than the in-house phone system.

1108
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:20,061
And that phone system couldn't have all of us

1109
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:20,562
at the same time.

1110
00:52:20,582 --> 00:52:22,563
There were groups of us on the phone

1111
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:24,164
together separate from other groups.

1112
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:27,086
And so the QA people see Lord Brist go down.

1113
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:29,187
And they're going like, well, how do we get him back to life?

1114
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,569
And Star sees me go down.

1115
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:35,391
And I'm going, whoo, is all I can say, because I'm a ghost.

1116
00:52:36,012 --> 00:52:39,914
And so everybody's scrambling to figure out what to do.

1117
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:41,895
And Star comes up with a brilliant idea.

1118
00:52:42,483 --> 00:52:44,404
Yeah, so I unleashed a bunch of demons in the crowd.

1119
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:48,626
And then we had GMs protecting him

1120
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:49,826
so no one could loot his body.

1121
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:54,808
But it was really funny just because at that moment,

1122
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:59,230
it really was for us just one of these kind

1123
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,131
of joyous emergent moments.

1124
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,013
Yeah, I mean, the king was dead, right?

1125
00:53:05,073 --> 00:53:07,133
And I think for all of us, that was the moment

1126
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:08,594
that we realized, right?

1127
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:11,535
This was no longer about control.

1128
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:18,116
right? The new rulers of our virtual world that now we all play in all the time.

1129
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:24,358
This was really the moment when we realized the players are going to be the ones who topple

1130
00:53:24,378 --> 00:53:32,101
the kings. This was the moment we realized what we had set free. You, right? We had set

1131
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:38,743
you free. And, you know, no offense, but Richard was no longer the ruler of fantasy worlds.

1132
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:40,784
The power was now.

1133
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:45,315
in your hands and from the bottom of all of our hearts

1134
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:48,917
I think we actually want to say thank you

1135
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:52,259
for that. Thank you so much. Thank you for killing Richard.

1136
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:54,421
Don't do it again.

1137
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,784
So you know, the CA's promised to give me time signals,

1138
00:54:14,824 --> 00:54:17,386
and those lights are so bright, I can't even see the CA.

1139
00:54:17,406 --> 00:54:18,527
So we have five minutes.

1140
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:19,347
Five minutes.

1141
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:20,808
So timed perfectly.

1142
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:21,109
Good.

1143
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:23,190
So there's time for just enough questions,

1144
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,371
but there's way too many of you.

1145
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:29,655
We have access to the two overflow rooms over there.

1146
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:32,637
So if we run out of time, please meet us over there.

1147
00:54:32,697 --> 00:54:34,519
Please do remember to fill out the surveys.

1148
00:54:34,879 --> 00:54:36,460
Fives are a wonderful number.

1149
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,842
We really like the number five.

1150
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:42,977
All right, Dr. Katt, we shouted out to you earlier.

1151
00:54:43,037 --> 00:54:43,717
You weren't here.

1152
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:45,899
We gave you a shout out, a screenshot and everything.

1153
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:46,400
All right.

1154
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:46,620
Yeah.

1155
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,040
What's up?

1156
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,681
I'm going to have to look on the vault.

1157
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,043
I got here two minutes late and I missed my moment.

1158
00:54:51,564 --> 00:54:55,787
I just wanted to ask you guys during those first couple of minutes.

1159
00:54:56,268 --> 00:55:00,031
Did you also give a shout out to James Van Aertsdalen who tried to make

1160
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:03,093
Multima based on Ultima IV code briefly in the 1980s?

1161
00:55:04,973 --> 00:55:07,154
We covered some of the history of previous Multimas.

1162
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:08,034
But not that one in particular, no.

1163
00:55:08,274 --> 00:55:08,874
But not that one.

1164
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:09,154
Yeah.

1165
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,435
So yeah, shout out to James Van Aerts, Dale,

1166
00:55:11,495 --> 00:55:14,737
and to who made the first attempt to bring that up.

1167
00:55:16,337 --> 00:55:18,238
Yeah, because how many were there?

1168
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:20,639
It was actually, you guys tried for years.

1169
00:55:20,699 --> 00:55:21,959
We talked about it for years and years and years.

1170
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:25,661
We just never really got momentum until Ultima.

1171
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,241
All right, next question, anyone?

1172
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:27,461
Yes.

1173
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:31,112
Yeah, I just wanted to say, I was a longtime player,

1174
00:55:31,272 --> 00:55:33,373
and both in the counselor and SEER program.

1175
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:36,514
The SEER program is something that I've never really seen

1176
00:55:36,554 --> 00:55:37,755
the equivalent of since.

1177
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:39,136
Do you have any thoughts on that?

1178
00:55:39,456 --> 00:55:44,298
And having players doing interest events

1179
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:46,058
in a truly massive game.

1180
00:55:46,759 --> 00:55:48,940
Yeah, it's a pattern out of mud, right?

1181
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,000
Yeah, it is.

1182
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,442
It's one of those things that you don't tend to see

1183
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:55,082
done as much because of legal risks

1184
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:56,383
around volunteer systems.

1185
00:55:57,038 --> 00:55:58,439
which we had to work around carefully.

1186
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:01,340
And because of scale, right?

1187
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,841
It just, you know, it becomes hard to manage.

1188
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:05,221
Yeah, let me take a run at it too though,

1189
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:07,462
which is the problem is when you give them anything,

1190
00:56:08,062 --> 00:56:11,123
any powers beyond any other user.

1191
00:56:11,783 --> 00:56:13,804
And so the way we, the approach we're now taking

1192
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:17,425
with our new game is to, you know,

1193
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:18,985
if you think about who in the real world

1194
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,086
are good storytellers or good chefs to make restaurants

1195
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,406
or good architects that make buildings,

1196
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:25,607
there's a natural competition to weed out

1197
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,133
bad creators, if you know what I mean.

1198
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:31,495
Their work, their plot of land,

1199
00:56:32,176 --> 00:56:34,077
the taxes on it becomes too much and they go away

1200
00:56:34,137 --> 00:56:35,938
and somebody who does a better job comes in on their stead.

1201
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:38,841
And that's why normally in a virtual world,

1202
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:41,603
if you unleash too much power to everyone equally,

1203
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:44,645
not everyone is a great creator

1204
00:56:44,885 --> 00:56:46,226
and so you end up with a world full of trash.

1205
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:50,549
And so versus bequest power to seers,

1206
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:54,072
we're now believers in bequest the power to everybody.

1207
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:57,647
just give an ability, a cost to put things in the world

1208
00:56:57,687 --> 00:56:58,748
that otherwise it gets cleaned up.

1209
00:56:59,308 --> 00:57:02,090
And that way only the good creators' stuff persists.

1210
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,232
We had in Star Wars Galaxies ended up

1211
00:57:05,892 --> 00:57:09,615
eventually launching what was called a storyteller system,

1212
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:13,217
which allowed players to gain access

1213
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:15,398
to a constrained set of tools

1214
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:17,960
so that they could build quests and run events for one another.

1215
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:20,948
But it was a constrained set rather than basically handing

1216
00:57:21,348 --> 00:57:23,989
an all-powerful client off to strangers.

1217
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:25,449
Thank you.

1218
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,750
Any more?

1219
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,310
Oh, come on.

1220
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:31,150
There we go.

1221
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,591
Oh, it's a question.

1222
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,071
Thanks so much for making this incredible game.

1223
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,352
I am curious about the degradation of houses

1224
00:57:38,752 --> 00:57:41,592
and sort of major, you know, you worked a long time

1225
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:43,173
to get a house, and then you managed

1226
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:45,793
to find a spot to place it, and then you don't show up

1227
00:57:45,813 --> 00:57:46,653
for a while and it goes away.

1228
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:47,593
Yeah.

1229
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:49,971
I'd love to hear more about the design.

1230
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:50,252
Sure.

1231
00:57:50,612 --> 00:57:51,553
We didn't have enough space.

1232
00:57:52,293 --> 00:57:55,855
When we expected 1 10th of the number of players on the map,

1233
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:58,978
we had left clearings for that many houses.

1234
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:02,980
And instead, 1 in 10 players could find space for a house.

1235
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:06,283
There are features, probably still live in the game,

1236
00:58:06,823 --> 00:58:10,666
where those clearings, it used to be before players populated

1237
00:58:10,706 --> 00:58:15,049
every space, we would actually spawn NPC camps and buildings

1238
00:58:15,189 --> 00:58:15,629
in those.

1239
00:58:16,012 --> 00:58:18,333
that you could come in and fight them, the orc camps and whatnot.

1240
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:20,374
And after enough houses were placed,

1241
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,076
that feature never happened again, because people couldn't even,

1242
00:58:23,236 --> 00:58:24,497
there was no place to spawn those.

1243
00:58:25,078 --> 00:58:30,141
So we had to have decay, and we had to have cleanup in the system,

1244
00:58:31,282 --> 00:58:33,663
tuning how quickly and how fast,

1245
00:58:34,184 --> 00:58:38,346
particularly given that there was unlimited ability to store things in the house.

1246
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:40,388
So to give people some perspective,

1247
00:58:40,408 --> 00:58:44,430
you guys think Battlefield or something has a lot of dynamic stuff running around in it?

1248
00:58:45,037 --> 00:58:47,898
you know, hundreds of players and hundreds of bullets flying.

1249
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:52,221
Any given arbitrary house in U.O. probably had 20 to 30,000

1250
00:58:53,342 --> 00:58:56,624
dynamic objects simultaneously, each of them capable

1251
00:58:56,664 --> 00:58:59,766
of running scripted behaviors in real time, right?

1252
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,308
So yeah, we had to clean it up.

1253
00:59:03,388 --> 00:59:04,249
We didn't have a choice.

1254
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:04,929
Yeah.

1255
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,991
And it was also a matter of maintaining interest

1256
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:09,252
for other people as well.

1257
00:59:09,332 --> 00:59:13,855
So if someone would just go and claim land and then

1258
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:20,428
never use it. That for us, that was a waste of community space, right? And so

1259
00:59:20,448 --> 00:59:28,031
that was another reason for the decay. Thanks. All right, well why don't we...

1260
00:59:28,051 --> 00:59:30,672
We're out of time, so why don't we move outside. So we're gonna go to the

1261
00:59:30,752 --> 00:59:32,172
overflow space 22... what is it? 2022 and 2024.
